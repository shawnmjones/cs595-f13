Bill Gates Statement in Response to G20 Leaders Summit Final Communiqué

   Cannes, France, November 4 - Bill Gates welcomed the G20 leaders'
   Communiqué, particularly the strong commitments to move forward in
   critical areas of global development and food security.

   "It was a great privilege to have been asked by G20 Chair President
   Nicolas Sarkozy to address the G20 on financing for development, and to
   be able to hear, in person, world leaders' strong commitment
   to ensuring that the needs of the poorest are not neglected," said
   Gates.

   "I am pleased that many of the recommendations in my report,
   `[13]Innovation with Impact: Financing 21^st Century Development' are
   reflected in the communiqué - including the need for developed
   countries to meet their aid commitments and explore innovative
   financing options, and the need to promote triangular partnerships that
   draw on the expertise and experience of big emerging economies in key
   areas like health and agriculture."

   Gates also said he was encouraged by the G20's new multi-year Action
   Plan to address food security, and welcomed the first steps of
   implementation led by the French presidency, but warned that it was
   critical to continue to turn rhetorical commitments into resources and
   results.

   "Nothing has greater potential to build broader global stability and
   long-term economic growth while making deep inroads into poverty than
   major new investments in boosting agricultural productivity in the
   developing world," Gates said.

   Noting that the G20 represents the opportunity to bring all countries
   into the global economy, Gates stated, "I'm encouraged by the G20's
   strong commitment to build on the unprecedented progress in health and
   development achieved in the last decade and to improve the lives of the
   world's poorest."

   The Billl & Melinda Gates Foundation stands ready to work with the
   Mexican Presidency (host of the 2012 G20 Summit) and other partners to
   turn the recommendations in the report into concrete actions that can
   increase global stability and put the poorest countries and people on a
   long-term path to economic growth and equity.  These actions include
   further funding for agricultural research and support for the
   pioneering Global Agriculture and Food Security Program that can be
   implemented over the coming months."

   Why Aid is Important by Bill Gates
   [24]

   November 01, 2011

Why We Must Stay Committed to Alleviating Poverty

   Over the last 50 years, development aid has contributed to advances in
   agriculture and health that have saved a billion people from starvation
   and millions more from deadly diseases. Despite the current economic
   crisis, it's important that the world's wealthier nations continue to
   look beyond their national borders. Maintaining their current
   commitment level - about 1% of public spending - will save lives and
   dramatically improve living and economic conditions in the world's
   poorest countries.
