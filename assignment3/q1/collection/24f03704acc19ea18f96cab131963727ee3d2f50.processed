   [29]North Carolina:

    An N.C. House lawmaker is equating any prayer to the Islamic God with
                                 terrorism.

   In an email exchange with a constituent, Republican state Rep. Michele
     Presnell of Burnsville was asked whether she was comfortable with a
   prayer to Allah before a legislative meeting. Presnell responded: "No,
                        I do not condone terrorism."

   The first-year lawmaker who represents a district in the North Carolina
   mountains is a co-sponsor of House resolution 494, a measure asserting
             that North Carolina can establish a state religion.

   Top that, Oklahoma. What's that? [30]You can?

      The founder of a tea party group in Oklahoma was charged with two
      felonies on Tuesday for allegedly sending threatening emails to a
     Republican lawmaker after he refused buy in to the notion that the
   United Nations was conspiring to transform the country into a communist
                             dictatorship. [...]

   Gerhart had been angry because [Sen. Cliff Branan (R)] refused to allow
       a vote on a bill that would have ensured Oklahoma cities do not
      participate in Agenda 21, a United Nations initiative to promote
    environmentally sustainable development. Conspiracy theorists on the
    right have long thought that Agenda 21 was a "conspiracy to transform
      America from the land of the free, to the land of the collective"
        through "a mind-control" tactic called the Delphi technique.

   Lovely.

   [31]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2005--Guantanamo
   Bay military tribunals: "I don't care about international law.":

   The government is holding about 550 terrorist suspects at the U.S. Navy
    base in Cuba. An additional 214 have been released since the facility
        opened in January 2002 - some into the custody of their home
                     governments, others freed outright.

     Little information about those held at Guantanamo has been released
     through official government channels. But stories of 60 or more are
     spelled out in detail in thousands of pages of transcripts filed in
     U.S. District Court in Washington, where lawsuits challenging their
                         detentions have been filed.

        The previously anonymous detainees provide accounts of their
    imprisonment and impressions of U.S. justice. Some express defiance,
                   others stoic acceptance of their fate.

   On today's [36]Kagro in the Morning show, the Senate's attempt at
   getting to debate on a gun bill is underway as a bipartisan deal on
   background checks is announced. What'll become of the threatened
   filibuster? Monte Frank told us about simultaneous "Filibuster the
   Filibuster" events in Newtown & DC to protest Republican obstruction.
   NC's nutters are backing off the establishment of a state religion,
   while IN's nutters are stepping up their game. We returned to the NYT's
   "A Secret Deal on Drones, Sealed in Blood." And just before closing,
   snuck in a quick report on the early word on the background check
   compromise.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [49]Tagging tips - [50]Search For Tags - [51]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   our little feet..."

   [331]http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/...

     The National Rifle Association said Wednesday the group is
     unequivocally opposed to the newly-struck compromise plan to expand
     background checks -- and threatened that it may seek to penalize
     lawmakers who vote for what it deems "anti-gun" measures by giving
     them poor grades in their rating system.

     The warning to members of Congress came just hours after a
     compromise on expanding background checks for gun purchasers was
     announced, a deal that the NRA itself participated closely in.

     "Expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not
     reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools," top
     NRA lobbyist Chris Cox wrote in a letter sent to senators Wednesday
     night. "Given the importance of these issues, votes on all anti-gun
     amendments or proposals will be considered in NRA's future candidate
     evaluations."

     Brad Paisley Is Still Happy About His 'Accidental' Racism

     Why did country star Brad Paisley write the song "Accidental
     Racist"? Because he thinks it's time musicians step in to have a
     national conversation about race.

     Paisley told Ellen DeGeneres Tuesday that, along with LL Cool J, he
     wrote the song to spark the dialogue that has been going on for a
     while but that he apparently has never before noticed. "I don't know
     if any of you have noticed but there's some racial tension here and
     there?" Paisley joked. The Ellen audience laughed-ish. "I don't
     really trust Hollywood ... or talk radio or anything like that to
     sort of deal with that [race] anymore. I think it's music's turn to
     have the conversation." Music has been having this conversation for
     a long time.

 Republicanism as it relates to education. ([650]7+ / 0-)

   Today, I stumbled across this sobering and somewhat desperate plea on
   the West Virginia University planning division's webpage:

     WVU is operating in financially uncertain times. The University is
     facing a proposed 8.9% cut in state appropriations ($13.3M), a
     competitive enrollment environment, and reductions in federal
     appropriations and research grant funds due to sequestration. There
     is also concern that the decline in state revenue collections and
     growing mandates at the state level may negatively impact state
     appropriated allocations in FY15.

     As the FY14 revenue picture becomes clearer, the campus community is
     urged to explore various options to effectively manage the loss of
     state appropriations. The magnitude and duration of the state cuts
     will have an impact on the type of corrective actions required to
     maintain the University's stable financial position.

     At this time, it would be helpful if the University community would
     assist senior leadership in developing a list of cost saving and
     revenue generating ideas; (e.g., consolidating programs and
     modification to existing practices or policies to streamline
     operations). Please share your ideas by e-mailing
     budget_suggestions@mail.wvu.edu

   I'm sure that there is fat to be cut somewhere there and economies of
   scale to be reached, but the overwhelming feeling in reading this was
   that this is a nation in decline.

   Sen. Judy Burges (R-Skull Valley) has introduced [676]SB 1403 to
   prohibit adopting or implementing the United Nations Rio Declaration,
   the sinister Agenda 21.
   From Sen. Steve Farley (D-Sanity):

     To get a flavor for the broad scope of their thinking, listen to
     these quotes from anti-Agenda 21 groups who will be sharing their
     thoughts on Thursday:

         "UN Agenda 21/Sustainable Development is the action plan
     implemented worldwide to inventory and control all land, all water,
     all minerals, all plants, all animals, all construction, all means
     of production, all energy, all education, all information, and all
     human beings in the world. INVENTORY AND CONTROL."
         "Moreover, people should be rounded up off the land and packed
     into human settlements, or islands of human habitation, close to
     employment centers and transportation. Whole towns need to be
     demolished and rebuilt in the image of sustainable development.
     Bike groups are being used as the 'shock troops' for this plan."
         "This plan is a whole life plan.  It involves the educational
     system, the energy market, the transportation system, the
     governmental system, the health care system, food production, and
     more.  The plan is to restrict your choices, limit your funds,
     narrow your freedoms, and take away your voice."
         Elements of the conspiracy include: The United States Green
     Building Council, the American Planning Association, Light Rail,
     Common Core curriculum for our schools, New Urbanism, planning and
     zoning, downtown revitalization efforts, non-conservative political
     leaders, income taxes, energy efficiency programs, gun restrictions,
     illegal immigration, the Federal Reserve, paper money, chemtrail
     spraying from jet planes, climate change scientists, walkable
     communities, public transit, college readiness programs, and clean
     air and clean water laws.

   Arizona for the win.

   The free market is not the solution, the free market is the problem.

   parroting the same RW talking points about the dire state of the
   deficit and how if we don't tame it immediately by cutting entitlements
   (which are going broke according to them) and "broadening the base",
   really bad things will happen to our children and grandchildren? They
   can't all have spontaneously come to this view on their own, obviously.
   Has ALEC taken over much of the Democratic party? They sound like a
   bunch of AEI/Cato drones.

   Obviously, this is coordinated, and these Dems have either been
   "trained" to say these things in exchange for big campaign donations,
   or were hand-picked by the DNC, DSCC & DCCC because they already held
   these views or seemed willing to promote them in exchange for those
   donations and political support as they ran for office. They might as
   well be Repubs on economic policy.

   Does anyone know how this specifically works, meaning what specific
   groups are behind this, what consultant and strategist firms are
   involved in this, whether this has a program name sort of like a
   corporate version of the 50 State Strategy, etc.? It's quite creepy,
   kind of scary, and appears to be part of an overall strategy of taking
   over enough of both parties to make the two party system effectively
   moot. We all know that it's happening. I just want to know some of the
   details. Who's behind this, specifically?

   Gee thanks, President Obama! I was mystified how the heck you ever got
   elected, being a black man and a Democrat on top of that. Now, with
   your proposed cuts to Social Security, I know you really are just an
   extremely tanned Republican (do you go to the same tanning salon as
   John Boehner?), so I no longer have to waste time wondering whether
   this country was getting better or worse. Apparently it's getting
   worse, if you are willing to make poor old people eat Meow Mix just so
   robber barons like Mitt Romney can hide more of their surplus cash in
   the Cayman Islands. And thanks for teaching us a stereotype-shattering
   lesson in not expecting all educated black people to be liberal;
   destroying Social Security is the ultimate wet dream of many a
   conservative who despises the government doing anything for anybody
   other than rich white Republicans.

   PS from some other fans: Monsanto sends you all its love and kisses! So
