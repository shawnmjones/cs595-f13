Omaha suffers rash of shootings in less than 1 hour; 3 dead

   By CNN Staff
   updated 1:36 PM EDT, Sun June 16, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Police say first victim was targeted, other attacks were
       random, CNN affiliate reports
     * Three people are dead and two are critically injured
     * Authorities release names of four victims
     * Four shootings occur within an hour in south Omaha, police say

   (CNN) -- Four shootings in less than an hour left three people dead in
   Omaha, Nebraska, police said.

   Two shooting victims were killed, as was one gunman, who was not
   identified, police said. Two other people were critically wounded.

   The shootings all took place in south Omaha on Saturday, the same day
   the city kicked off the College World Series -- the NCAA championship
   for baseball.

   Officers responded at 2:03 p.m. to the first shooting, which left
   31-year-old Aaron Anderson in critical condition, police said.

   At 2:23 p.m., police responded to another shooting across town, which
   critically injured 46-year-old Angel Cabrera.

   Four minutes later, officers arrived at the scene of a third shooting.
   Pascual Bautista-Raymundo, 25, was hospitalized but later died, police
   said.

   Around 2:30 p.m., there was a fourth shooting, in which 25-year-old
   Anthony Vazzano died. A neighbor followed the suspect and gave police
   his location.

   When officers caught up with the suspect, a gunbattle ensued. Police
   fatally shot the suspect; no officers were injured.

   Omaha police said at a Sunday news conference that it appeared Anderson
   was targeted and the other shootings were random, [41]CNN affiliate
   KETV reported.

   Police also are looking for the driver of a 1995 Ford Thunderbird who
   was seen near Anderson's apartment before the shooting, the station
   said.
