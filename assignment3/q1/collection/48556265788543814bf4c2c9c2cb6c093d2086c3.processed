ones

   [29]Matthew Rothschild at The Progressive writes House Republicans say
   no free lunch for poor kids:

     [T]he poor and the hungry shouldn't have to suffer because of Wall
     Street's excesses and George Bush's wars.

     If Republicans wanted to make reasonable cuts out of the Farm Bill,
     they should have gone after corporate welfare to the giant food
     companies.

     But no, they'd rather take a poor kid's meal away.

   [30]Greg Grandin at The New York Times writes Slaughter Was Part of
   Reagan's Hard Line:

     Once in office, Reagan, continued to supply munitions and training
     to the Guatemalan army, despite a ban on military aid imposed by the
     Carter administration (existing contracts were exempt from the ban).
     And economic aid continued to flow, increasing to $104 million in
     1986, from $11 million in 1980, nearly all of it going to the rural
     western highlands, where the Mayan victims of the genocide lived.

     This aid helped the Guatemalan military implement a key part of its
     counterinsurgency campaign: following the massacres, soldiers herded
     survivors into "model villages," detention camps really, where they
     used food and other material supplied by the U.S. Agency for
     International Development to establish control.

   [31]Ellen Bravo at In These Times writes The Right to Call In Sick:

     In each location, the movement for paid sick days is backed by a
     broad coalition that includes dozens of partners from labor
     (including unions like UFCW and AFSCME, and Working America and the
     Working Families Party) together with small-business owners and
     groups that advocate for women, children, seniors, public health,
     racial justice and LGBT rights (Portland's coalition is a member of
     the Family Values @ Work Consortium, a network of 21 state
     coalitions working for policies like paid sick days, of which I
     serve as executive director). But what's most notable is how these
     groups have engaged new activists like Lund, who hadn't been
     politically active before, but who share the common experience of
     fearing for their jobs if they or their child gets sick.

   Below the fold are more pundits to read.

   [32]Julian Sanchez at Mother Jones asks Is the Government Spying on
   Reporters More Often Than We Think?:

     It wouldn't be surprising if there were more cases like this we've
     never heard about. Here's why: The Justice Department's rules only
     say the media must be informed about "subpoenas" for "telephone toll
     records." The FBI's operations guidelines interprets those rules
     quite literally, making clear the requirement "concerns only grand
     jury subpoenas." That is, these rules don't apply to National
     Security Letters, which are secret demands for information used by
     the FBI that don't require judicial approval. The narrow FBI
     interpretation also doesn't cover administrative subpoenas, which
     are issued by federal agencies without prior judicial review. Last
     year, the FBI issued NSLs for the communications and financial
     records of more than 6,000 Americans--and the number has been far
     higher in previous years. The procedures that do apply to those
     tools have been redacted from publicly available versions of the FBI
     guidelines.

   [33]Jessica Valenti at The Nation informs us In 2016, I'm casting my
   vote for a woman. Not because she's guaranteed to be the most feminist
   candidate, but because I'm fed up.:

     Voting for a woman with the sole purpose of breaking the most
     important political glass ceiling in the country--possibly the
     world--does give me pause. The belief that a female politician is
     inherently more woman-friendly is the same misguided notion that
     allowed even Sarah Palin--who, as mayor of Wasilla, made women pay
     for their own rape kits and, as governor of Alaska, cut funding for
     a shelter for teen moms--to call herself a feminist. And the
     insistence on putting gender above all other identities often means
     that white women take the lead. I'll never forget being told by a
     representative of a mainstream women's organization that they were
     looking for a panelist for an election-related event who "wouldn't
     trump race over gender." I still believe that my 2008 vote was the
     right one, and that expecting women to vote for a female politician
     simply because they share the same gender is cynical and
     shortsighted.

     But I'm also absolutely exhausted. Why?

   [34]Paul Pillar, former CIA analyst, writes at Consortium News about
   The Great Benghazi Distraction:

     As the pseudo-scandal continues to be pushed, other costs come to
     mind. An obvious one is the big distraction this entails from useful
     work Congress could otherwise be doing. Of course, we are no
     strangers to similarly ineffective use of congressional time and
     attention. Probably the Benghazi kick has been no more of a
     distraction than the House of Representatives voting for the 33rd
     time (or maybe it's more -- it's so many there doesn't seem to be an
     accurate count) to repeal Obamacare.

     One also needs to consider, however, the drain on the time and
     attention of officials in the Executive Branch. Having five
     different House committees holding hearings on the same subject is
     an enormous diversion from the main duties of those who are
     responsible for diplomatic security.

   [35]Jay Janson at Dissident Voice writes  Guatemala's Ríos Montt
   Genocide Conviction: Omen for US Presidents and Their Assassins:

     US President Ronald Reagan also had the power to stop the massacres
     being perpetrated by dictator General and President Ríos Montt.
     Reagan must have been aware of them, known enough about them, and
     could have stopped those year-and-half-long massacres with far less
     effort than President Eisenhower had made in ordering the bloody and
     merciless overthrowing of a popularly elected president, a
     democratic president, who in making land reform, had gotten in the
     way of the massive United Fruit Company that owned more than half of
     Guatemala. In the case of the President of Guatemala and in
     President Reagan's case, there was no room for sentiment. It was
     just business.

   [36]Juliette Kayyem at The Miami Herald writes Melting Arctic requires
   U.S. action:

     Right before Kerry left for Sweden, the White House released a much
     anticipated white paper, "National Strategy for the Arctic Region."
     It is 13 pages long; that is, at least, twice the length of the
     Arctic strategy memo released under George W. Bush. While Obama's
     plan lays out basic principles for cooperative stewardship of the
     region, it has been uniformly criticized for lacking any specific
     means to assert American interests, protect the environment, and set
     standards for exploration.

     Summer is coming. The ice is melting. And we seem to have no place
     to go.

   [37]Doug Henwood at LBO writes Deficit emergency over:

     The Congressional Budget Office's latest debt and deficit
     projections for the next ten years are out and there's no way any
     honest analyst could read them as anything but the official end to
     any rational concern about red ink.[...]

     So what will the fiscal sadists do? The CBO itself offers a hint of
     how to maintain deficit hysteria--the deficit will rise from 2020 to
     2023, and could get really bad in the late 2020s (though they don't
     provide any numbers). Egads! But the rise in the debt/GDP ratio from
     2020 to 2023 is all of 2.2 percentage points, to a level still below
     today's--and projections 15 or 20 years into the future are a thin
     support for drastic action today. (This is further proof of the rule
     that one should always read the numbers before the prose in official
     reports like these.) But that doesn't mean fiscal hawks won't piss
     and moan. They will. But their emoting will either have to get even
     more phantasmic--or more nakedly class war-ish.

     If only we could get important people to show this level of
     long-term anxiety about atmospheric CO2.

   [38]Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes GOP's biggest obstacle on
   Benghazi/IRS/AP: Americans' attention spans:

     To watch the news coverage this week, you'd think the Obama
     administration was on its last legs.

     The good news for the Obama administration is that relatively few
     people are watching the news coverage.

   [39]John R. MacArthur at Harper's writes In Boston, An Exercise in
   Intimidation:

     As Emilo Viano, of the Department of Justice, Law and Society at
     American University, noted on Quebec radio, the massive,
     disproportionate show of force in Boston "was practically a military
     exercise" that "demonstrated more a wish to see what nowadays can be
     done through cooperation by federal, state and local police with the
     military." In short, it was a tactical operation designed more for
     the symbolic value of its intimidation than to catch the killers.

     But who in public life dares to say such things in the midst of a
     terrorist "crisis," when everyone seems impressed by the sight of
     massed men in uniform. Only the marginalized seemed up to the task.

   [40]Timothy Noah at The New York Times writes The 1 Percent Are Only
   Half the Problem:

     The decline of labor unions is what connects the skills-based gap to
     the 1 percent-based gap. Although conservatives often insist that
     the 1 percent's richesse doesn't come out of the pockets of the 99
     percent, that assertion ignores the fact that labor's share of gross
     domestic product is shrinking while capital's share is growing.
     Since 1979, except for a brief period during the tech boom of the
     late 1990s, labor's share of corporate income has fallen. Pension
     funds have blurred somewhat the venerable distinction between
     capital and labor. But that's easy to exaggerate, since only about
     one-sixth of all households own stocks whose value exceeds $7,000.
     According to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, the G.D.P.
     shift from labor to capital explains fully one-third of the 1
     percent's run-up in its share of national income. It couldn't have
     happened if private-sector unionism had remained strong.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Hear, hear! Anyway, Gillibrand is 'No Labels' ([158]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [159]SueDe

       affiliated.  Or at least she was, since she participated in the
       'kickoff of this group in 2010.'

     This organization, along with Peterson's 'Fix The Debt Campaign,'
     Third Way, etc., are primary 'promoters' of 'austerity measures,' or
     'the Grand Bargain' to cut social insurance programs.

     Heck, Joe Scarborough, David Brooks, former CBO Director David
     Walker, Joe Manchin (WV), Angus King (Me), Jon Huntsman, etc., are
     members of 'this outfit.'
       Don't forget, her nomination was forced by the Clintons over that
       of Caroline Kennedy.  I've read that she represented one of the
       reddest districts in New York as a US (or state--not sure which)
       Representative.
       She may be somewhat moderate to liberal on a wedge issue or two,
       but frankly, I'd be cautious.

     From Salon, [160]The sad, inevitable return of Harold Ford,
     Wednesday, Jan 6, 2010 10:54 AM CST:

     . . . The New York Times reports that appointed Democratic Senator
     Kirsten Gillibrand "has yet to win over key constituencies," leaving
     an opening for a primary challenge. . . .
     First of all, Gillibrand herself was considered an excessively
     conservative pick, and has spent the last year running leftward to
     forestall a primary challenge. She's flipped her positions on gay
     marriage and immigration. In other words, if she's vulnerable
     anywhere, it's on her left. That's what the Times means when it says
     she's having trouble nailing down key constituencies.
       From what I've read about her, she appears to be a typical DLC-type
       'fiscal conservative.'  Personally, I would not rely on her to
       defend Social Security and/or Medicare.  It sounds as though she
       has moderated her views on a couple of social issues to avoid the
       wrath of 'the base.'  I am concerned that Ms. Gillibrand may throw
       her support behind the Administration when it comes to striking a
       'Grand Bargain.' [and cutting Social Security and Medicare, as
       indicated in the President's 2013-2014 Budget]
       I'm going to try to find a David Walker video from C-Span and post
       it so that folks can see how 'off-the-charts' this organization is.
       Walker sounds like Alan Simpson, and he is one of the main
       spokespersons for this organization.  Frankly, this group is more
       toxic than the DLC, IMO.
       Can't imagine a Democrat running as an ally, or member of this
       'bunch,' after over three years of threats to our social insurance
       programs.  Seems to me that it would be political suicide to have
       any association with them, past or present.
       I will be posting on the 'No Labels' monthly town halls on XM
       Radio.  Wisely, the XM Channel that's hosting these ridiculous
       events, don't 'do' podcasts!  But that okay, I'm taking notes, and
       will 'blog' on these events.
       Below is a short blurb about her participation in the kickoff of
       'No Labels.'  BTW, the December 2010 date 'is no accident,' I'm
       sure.  The kickoff was almost immediately after the Bowles-Simpson
       Chairman's Mark, [161]"The Moment Of Truth," was made public (this
       is the President's Fiscal Commission's recommendations, which is
       the 'framework' for the 'Grand Bargain').

     Political Insiders Launch `No Labels' To Support Moderation In
     Washington

     Jillian Rayfield December 13, 2010, 1:34 PM
     A group of high-profile Democrats, Republicans, and Independents
     today launched No Labels, a non-profit that calls itself the
     "Woodstock of Democracy," touts non-partisanship, and features a
     bipartisan bison as its official logo.
     The group kicked off at an event in New York today, with speakers
     like New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I), Sen. Kirsten
     Gillibrand (D-NY), and Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) appealing to the
     "vital center of our still-great country."
     and this excerpt from this piece 'Mayor Bloomberg Dons Bipartisan
     Purple Tie for 'No Labels' Kick-Off.'
         . . . More than 1,000 Republicans, Democrats and Independents
     were expected to join Bloomberg Monday at Columbia University for
     the "No Labels" event. Among the featured speakers in attendance
     were New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Indiana Senator Evan Bayh,
     and Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, who earned the animosity of
     some Democrats by losing the primary as a Democrat and going on to
     win the seat by running as an Independent.
     Gillibrand described the event as a "call to action to demand
     bipartisanship." . . .
     The group [No Labels] touts policies including reining in the
     deficit, securing Social Security and Medicaid, and "encouraging
     free and open markets, tempered by sensible regulation."
       Yeah, I agree with you, Albanius.
       Except that I would add that we can't afford more 'corporatist'
       Democrats in the Senate, either.   ;-)

       deflections, dissemblings, exaggerations and distracting rhetoric
       who can, at times, be funny.  David Walker is a bitter, determined,
       ideological right-wing fundamentalist for the moneyed class and is
       never funny and hardly ever even  listenable.

   His bulleted talking points have failed him.

     During a congressional hearing regarding the IRS on Friday, Rep.
     Peter Roskam (R-IL) inadvertently led the head of the IRS to
     contradict the notion that conservative nonprofits were singled out
     for scrutiny.

     At the hearing, outgoing acting IRS commissioner Steve Miller
     repeatedly objected to the use of the word "targeting." He said the
     so-called "be on the lookout" (BOLO) list was an "inappropriate"
     organizational tool or "shortcut" that IRS staff used to find
     potential political cases. Miller claimed the tea party groups would
     have be subjected to extra scrutiny regardless of the BOLO list.

     "If the targeting wasn't targeting, if the targeting wasn't based on
     philosophy, how come only conservatives got snagged?" Roskam
     confidently asked.

     "They didn't, sir," Miller responded. "Organizations of all walks
     and all persuasions were pulled in. That's shown by the fact that
     only 70 of the 300 organizations were tea party organizations, of
     the ones that were looked at by TIGTA [Treasury Inspector General
     for Tax Administration]."

     Roskam angrily cut off Miller and asserted his statement was at odds
     with the inspector general's testimony, then ended his questioning.

     Of the 298 groups subjected to additional review, 72 were "tea
     party" groups, 11 were "9/12'' groups and 13 were "patriots" groups,
     according to the inspector general's report.

 Derivatives Reform on the Ropes ([359]10+ / 0-)

          [367]skohayes, [368]wonmug, [369]Meteor Blades

   is the title of [370]an editorial in the NYTimes today.  The editorial
   examines rule-making in the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission's
   effort to implement transparency in the derivatives market called for
   in the Dodd-Frank bill, which was passed in the wake of the excesses in
   that market found to be the major cause of the economic collapse in the
   fall of 2008.

     New rules to regulate derivatives, adopted last week by the
     Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are a victory for Wall Street
     and a setback for financial reform. They may also signal worse
     things to come.
     ...
     In the run-up to the financial crisis -- and since -- the lack of
     transparency and competition has fostered recklessness and
     instability. But banks like opacity, because their outsized profits
     depend on keeping clients in the dark about what other clients pay
     in similar deals. Under the Dodd-Frank law, derivatives are supposed
     to be traded on "swap execution facilities," which are to operate
     much like the exchanges that exist for equities and futures.

     Even as the new rules shift much of the trading to those facilities,
     they will also preserve the ability of the banks to maintain their
     old practices.

   The CFTC consists of five commissioners appointed to staggered terms.
   Currently there are three Democrats and two Republicans on the
   commission, but one of the Democrats consistently votes with the
   Republicans to limit transparency of derivative trading.

     By themselves, these new rules are not fatal to the overall reform
     effort. And they are the best that the commission's reform-minded
     chairman, Gary Gensler, could achieve at this time because of
     resistance to tougher standards by the agency's two Republican
     commissioners and by one of its Democratic commissioners, Mark
     Wetjen.

     The problem now is that Mr. Gensler's term has officially ended, and
     he is expected to leave the agency at the end of the year. Given
     Wall Street's incessant lobbying and powerful presence in
     Washington, it is assumed that he will be replaced by a chairman who
     is friendlier to Wall Street. That bodes ill for rules that have
     started out weak and need to be shored up later. To lose a reformer
     would also reflect poorly on President Obama, but he has not yet
     shown interest in keeping Mr. Gensler in the government.

   And that's not the only problem that will remain when Gensler departs.

     In addition, none of the derivatives rules that have been finalized
     so far will make any real difference if they are not applied
     internationally. Yet Mr. Gensler has met fierce resistance -- from
     banks, some C.F.T.C. commissioners and regulators at the Securities
     and Exchange Commission -- to his plan to extend domestic rules to
     foreign affiliates of American banks and to foreign banks operating
     in the United States. Anything less broad would make a sham of
     derivatives reform.

   Details on the refusal of the SEC to put any teeth in the law at all
   will have to be the subject for another day.

       This is the crux of Mr. Wetjen's statement regarding the new rules
       to implement "Anti-Disruptive Trading Practices."

     SEFs, as registered entities, will be required to establish and
     enforce comprehensive compliance and surveillance programs that
     simply do not exist in the swap markets today.
       An SFE is a Swap Execution Facility, defined in Dodd-Frank as "a
       facility, trading system or platform in which multiple participants
       have the ability to execute or trade swaps by accepting bids and
       offers made by other participants that are open to multiple
       participants in the facility or system, through any means of
       interstate commerce."  The law expected CFTC regulations would be
       implemented on SEF's that would allow for transparency and provide
       the tools for a complete record and audit trail of trades with the
       CFTC having concomitant authority for enforcement.
       Under rules that were passed thanks to Mr. Wetjen's lining up with
       Republicans to block CFTC regulating authority, SEF's will now
       regulate themselves - and act as the enforcement body for their own
       regulations.  What could possibly go wrong....

     The organization's polling tells the same story: 90 percent of
     voters in battleground states would vote for a qualified woman
     candidate from their party, and 86 percent believe that America is
     ready to elect a female president.

   I believe those numbers are highly overoptimistic. What were the
   numbers like for people who said America was ready for a black
   president before Obama was elected? It's become pretty obvious that
   there is a significant portion of the population that are motivated to
   oppose him out of racial animus. How many people say America is ready
   for a woman because they think that's what a pollster wants to hear,
   when they really believe a woman's place is barefoot chained to the
   stove?

   "American Interests" around the world, Guatemala may prove to be one of
   the worst. The CIA backed ousting of a democratically elected Jacobo
   Arbenz in order to protect UFC (which both the Dulles brothers had
   direct ties to) was one of the most egregious examples of how our
   country prefers to protect the interests of the wealthy over helping
   the poor. 30 Years of civil war and the country still has one of the
   worst wealth gaps in the world, land is still collected in the hands of
   a few, and corporate interests take precedence over social programs.
   Our policy towards Guatemala has kept millions there in poverty and has
   led to systematic discrimination against the indigenous Maya
   population. I know most of those involved are dead at this point, but
   it would be nice to see someone formally acknowledge the barbarism that
   was our policy towards Guatemala.

   The AP scandal is a real scandal.

   If we talk about all three issues as one issue, it will be impossible
   to address each issue fairly. Real wrongdoing by the Obama
   administration will be lost in a welter of idiotic Republican
   propaganda on other issues. I'd like to think that the Democratic party
   doesn't need to hide behind a froth of Republican perfidy and unreason
   to justify its actions.

   I encourage everybody to address each issue on its own merits, look
   into the facts, and come to your own conclusions, rather than
   responding to three separate events as if they were one
   indistinguishable mass.

       In other words, we support George Bush's policies because George

     The key here is a legal principle known as the "third party
     doctrine," which says that users don't have Fourth Amendment rights
     protecting information they voluntarily turn over to someone else.
     Courts have said that when you dial a phone number, you are
     voluntarily providing information to your phone company, which is
     then free to share it with the government.
       Also noted in this article is that journalists get special
       treatment:

     Journalists get a bit of a special deal here. The government has
     established special policies to guard against inappropriate
     surveillance of reporters. Before an FBI agent can seek a
     journalist's call records, they must get special approval from the
     attorney general. But that's merely a Justice Department policy, not
     a constitutional requirement. The policy could be changed in the
     future, and the lack of independent oversight makes abuses more
     likely.
     The rest of the country doesn't get even the modest procedural
     protection the government affords to journalists. The FBI likely
     didn't need a warrant to obtain e-mail records that led to the
     identification of Paula Broadwell as the mistress of Gen. David
     Petraeus last year.

       What we are supporting is the idea that what the DOJ did is not and
       should not be referred to as a scandal because what the agency did
       was not illegal.  If congress thinks what happened is a scandal,
       they should repeal the portion of the Patriot Act that gives the
       cover of legality to what the DOJ did.

   This:

     The good news for the Obama administration is that relatively few
     people are watching the news coverage.

   We are finally so disgusted with ABC World Nudes Tonight that we simply
   turn off the TV after the local news and weather.  We would watch other
   programs such as BBC or PBS News Hour, but they're not on at 6:30 p.m.

   Wonder if the reason people don't watch the morning and evening news is
   because it's so revolting (sex, sleaze, and scandal), or because it's
   simply irrelevant.  Real news is never covered--only stuff about movie
   stars and murders.

 I stopped watching TV news in 1984 ... ([570]0+ / 0-)
       ... and ABC was the station I switched off, too.  But it could have
       been any station by that point in my life.
       It was the morning after the second Reagan-Mondale debate, and I
       switched on "ABC World News This Morning" to hear Kathleen Sullivan
       tell me that the top story of the day was that Reagan's people said
       Reagan had won the debate and Mondale's people said Mondale had won
       the debate.
       I said, "That's not news," turned off the set, and have not watched
       network news since.  (The only exception I've made was for about
       half an hour the night of 9/11/01 after I got home from my job in
       Boston.)
       Years later I learned that same debate was identified by the late
       William Safire as the night the terms "spin" and "spin doctor" were
       born.

   The VA GOP has managed to nominate a Tea Partier for LT Governor that
   somehow manages to be crazier than Ken Cucchinelli:

     and Cuccinelli fell out of a nutball tree and hit every branch on
     the way down.

   (the inestimable Charlie Pierce)

     Earlier this week, Jackson released a new video as part of this
     effort in which he blasted the Democratic Party for its ties to
     Planned Parenthood, which "has been far more lethal to Black lives
     than the KKK ever was," and for comparing the fight for marriage
     equality to the fight for civil rights, which Jackson called "an
     outrageous lie" and "an insult to human intelligence." Jackson went
     on to declare that "our ancestors were sold against their will
     centuries ago, but we're going to the slave market voluntarily
     today" by supporting the Democratic Party which has "become
     anti-Christian, anti-church, anti-Bible, anti-life, anti-family, and
     anti-God."  As such, "it is time to come out of the Democrat Party
     and to refuse to support its candidates in their rebellion against
     God."

 Regarding viewership of the news: ([584]2+ / 0-)

     The good news for the Obama administration is that relatively few
     people are watching the news coverage.

   Whenever a news agency/media outlet is given to offering items with any
   evident political bias as straight news, its veracity and reliability-
   its integrity- become suspect. It seems with many of our once-trusted
   news outlets that little or no regard has been given to maintaining
   objectivity and nurturing the public trust in the past few decades.

   Too bad. So sad.

 OT: To MB - Can you have a look at this ([589]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [590]Amber6541

   and eventually cover it in detail? I think it's very important:

   [591]Can We Save the Planet By Messing With Nature? I still can't calm
   down after having listened to it.

   You know I am driving by the Cato Institute every morning and after
   Hunter's recent diary about them glorifying the 400 ppm threshold of
   CO2 emissions, what I heard this morning about how they are again
   involved in support of "shielding the earth from the sun with a cloud
   of mirrors in space to deflect sunlight, thus preventing the sun's
   radiation to the earth and heating it up "too much".

   Imagine, on the one hand people try to develop solar energy by putting
   up solar panel farms capturing the sunlight to generate alternative
   energy, why at the same time "geoengineering nut-cracks" phantasizing
   about putting up a shield of mirrors above the clouds to avoid the
   sun's radiation to reach our earth's surface.

     We're joined now by Clive Hamilton, professor of public ethics at
     Charles Stuart University in Canberra, Australia. Hamilton's new
     book, "Earthmasters: The Dawn of the Age of Climate Engineering,"
     lays out the arguments for and against climate engineering, and
     reveals the vested interests behind it linking researchers, venture
     capitalists and corporations.

   The interview starts at TC 27:51.
   Transcript not out yet. I hope that gets some eyes and ears.
