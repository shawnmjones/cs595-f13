   Daniel Yergin, Author, The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of
   the Modern World

   June 29, 2012 | By Daniel Yergin

Daniel Yergin Replies to Bill's Review of His Book, "The Quest"

     Daniel Yergin is one of my favorite writers and his book, "The
     Quest", is a significant contribution to the conversation about the
     various forces shaping our energy future. I appreciate that he took
     the time to comment on my review of his book.

   I much appreciate Bill's thoughtful review of The Quest. He points to a
   central question--what will fuel transportation in the future? In the
   aftermath of the 1970s energy crises, a sharp division emerged between
   oil and other energy sources. In much of the world, oil was squeezed
   out of electric generation and primarily became a transportation fuel.
   Thus, when one talks about wind and solar today, that has very little
   to do with transportation. Transportation and electric generation, as
   Bill observes, are two separate worlds, with very little trade between
   them.

   Autos have become much more efficient over the last few decades and
   will become more efficient in the years ahead. Nevertheless, the
   challenge of fueling the world's growing population of cars will be
   huge. I try to phrase the problem simply in The Quest: how will the
   world cope, in terms of energy, in going from an auto population of 1
   billion cars to 2 billion? The most obvious answer is by becoming more
   efficient. And that will certainly be the case, where, in the United
   States for instance, the new car will go from about 30 miles per gallon
   today to 54 miles per gallon by early in the next decade. But that
   still implies oil as a fuel.

   Over the past decade, we have seen a sequence of initiatives to reduce
   oil dependence in transportation--hydrogen, biofuels, electric car,
   natural gas vehicles. Biofuels have made an impact. In the United
   States, on a volumetric basis, they constitute almost 10 percent of
   motor fuel. But there is a clear limit with ethanol and the other first
   generation biofuels. The second generation of biofuels is proving
   harder to attain than anticipated by some a few years ago.

   Around 2008, the electric car gained new prominence and commitment,
   although it is not a new concept. (See the wonderful picture in The
   Quest of Thomas Edison and Henry Ford discussing the automobile in
   1896, prior to Edison's efforts to promote the electric car!).

   From today's vantage point, electricity seems destined to play a larger
   role in transportation in the years ahead.  Wide dispersion of electric
   vehicles would break down the wall between transportation and electric
   generation and reduce the market share of oil. But informed
   expectations vary widely as to whether the electric car will be a niche
   vehicle or a mass market product, and it will probably be five to 10
   years before that is clear. Battery innovation and cost are key.

   But now there is a new competitor. Or rather, another old competitor
   with new vigor--natural gas. In some parts of the world, natural gas
   has long been an alternative fuel.  What is new is the North American
   shale gas revolution. Its prospect of abundant volumes of low-cost
   natural gas has made natural gas a new contender in the transportation
   market. Given current costs, it does appear that natural gas will
   expand its role in fueling fleets of buses and delivery and service
   trucks and could well gain share for large long-distance trucks. But
   the need and cost for refueling infrastructure constitute a major
   barrier to wide use in motor cars.

   All this leads to a very interesting question: Will natural gas gain
   share in transportation going directly into fuel tanks or by generating
   electricity that goes into electric vehicles?

   Both natural gas and coal are converted into liquids in a few
   situations around the world today. But the costs--and energy
   costs--raise major barriers to any notable expansion. For instance,
   China has stepped back from what were, a few years ago, ambitious
   targets for coal to liquids. The reason was cost.

   So all of this turns attention back to the importance of continuing to
   improve the energy efficiency of automobiles and gives very strong
   impetus to the now-familiar hybrid technology as a key enabler.

   But there is still that basic challenge of 2 billion cars. Economic
   growth and rising incomes are what will propel the world from 1 billion
   to 2 billion cars. That is a massive growth. Moving down that road will
   require a good deal of innovation along the various avenues that Bill
   described in his review.
