George Takei talks social media and justice at Cal Poly Pomona

   Takei: Oh My
     __________________________________________________________________

   POMONA - George Takei, best known for his role as Captain Hikaru Sulu
   on "Star Trek," is using social media as a platform to bring awareness
   to social injustice.

   Takei's popularity online is evident by 3.5 million "Likes" on his
   personal Facebook page and his more than 500,000 Twitter followers, not
   to mention his electronic book, "Oh Myyy! There Goes the Internet."

   Speaking to more than 600 Cal Poly Pomona students and many fans on
   Tuesday, the 75-year-old, openly gay Takei discussed his social media
   experience and how it has provided a new chapter to his career.

   For Takei, social media has been a vehicle to promote "Allegiance - A
   New American Musical," which is loosely based on his life. The musical
   details the experiences of Japanese-Americans, such as Takei, who were
   forced into internment camps.

   "Pearl Harbor was bombed and overnight American citizens of Japanese
   ancestry were seen as the enemy simply because of what we looked like.
   It was a time of racial history ... greed and lack of political
   leadership," Takei said during his talk titled "Social Justice in a
   Digital World."

   To help build an audience for the musical, Takei used various social
   media outlets.

   When he first started on the sites about two years ago, Takei would
   engage with his audience by talking about Star Trek and telling jokes.

   "We wanted to tell that story ... we needed to develop an audience
   beforehand and so I started Facebooking and Tweeting essentially to my
   core audience, which are science fiction, nerds and geeks, and build
   that up," Takei said.

   Once he saw there was a positive response, he started to talk about
   larger, often controversial, subjects and "Allegiance."

   The musical, which is set to be on Broadway in the fall, follows the
   story of the Kimura family and the Japanese-American internment in the
   weeks and years following Pearl Harbor.

   It is a story that is personal to Takei.

   When he was 5 years old, Takei and his family were forced out of their
   home and sent to a camp at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia and then to Tule
   Lake and Rohwer, Ark.

   "We went outside and the last to come out was my mother and she was
   carrying my baby sister in one arm and a huge duffle bag in the other
   and I saw tears streaming down her cheek - that's the picture that is
   burned into my memory," he said.

   Takei called the fallout from Pearl Harbor and how it impacted
   Japanese-Americans "a dark and shameful chapter of American history."

   "We've been making great progress and I expect tremendous progress to
   be made, but when you take where this country came from and where we
   are today we have made unimaginable progress," Takei said.

   Tuesday's speaking engagement was hosted by Cal Poly's Office of
   Student Life and Cultural Centers, which oversees the campus's six
   cultural centers.

   "I think that the bigger picture is that we really wanted to bring
   bring George Takei to talk about his background, beginnings, and
   individuals who influenced him to who he is today and in relation to
   that his experience as an Asian Pacific Islander individual as well as
   an LGBT individual and and more recently his involvement with social
   media and Facebook and Twitter," said Thavery Lay-Bounpraseuth,
   coordinator for Asian and Pacific Islander Student Center.

   "The bigger picture is to talk about social justice issues and looking
   at social media as the medium nowadays with college students, young
   individuals who are onto that."
