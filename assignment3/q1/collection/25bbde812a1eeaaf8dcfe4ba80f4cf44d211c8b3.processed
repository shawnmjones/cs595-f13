[24]Texas Defends Voting Laws: "We Don't Want Democrats To Vote"

   Good luck with that, Texas
   Oh, Texas.  What to do with you.

   So mere hours after the Supreme Court struck down Section 5 of the
   Voting Rights Act, Texas wasted no more time and re-instituted the same
   redistricting plan the courts had already ruled as unconstitutional.
   The same with their new voter suppression bill.

   Attorney General Holder was having none of it, however.  Texas was the
   first lawsuit to be filed by the Justice Department under Section 2 of
   the Voting Right Act.

   [30]And now Texas is presenting its defense. It is using two main
   arguments.

   And boy, are they doozies.

   Jump below the Chee-to for more:

   First, says Attorney General Greg Abbott, the redistricting is not
   about race.  Oh no.  It's about not allowing DEMOCRATS to vote.  White
   Democrats too.

   From their brief:

     DOJ's accusations of racial discrimination are baseless. In 2011,
     both houses of the Texas Legislature were controlled by large
     Republican majorities, and their redistricting decisions were
     designed to increase the Republican Party's electoral prospects at
     the expense of the Democrats....The redistricting decisions of which
     DOJ complains were motivated by partisan rather than racial
     considerations, and the plaintiffs and DOJ have zero evidence to
     prove the contrary. It is perfectly constitutional for a
     Republican-controlled legislature to make partisan districting
     decisions, even if there are incidental effects on minority voters
     who support Democratic candidates.

   Translation:

   "So, basically, we just want to fuck over all Democrats, and if the
   Black and Brown people are also hurt, well, they shouldn't vote for
   Democrats, should they?  It's only collateral damage"

   You know, having them actually come right out and say it--that they
   don't want Democrats to vote--is somehow not surprising.  But it's good
   that they're doing it at last.

   But wait!  There's more. To address the actual accusations of racial
   bias and discrimination, Texas is using the argument that "Yeah, there
   may be an isolated incident or two, but it's NOTHING like it was in
   1965".

   From the article, which says it better than I can:

     Furthermore, the state claims, even if Texas did discriminate, and
     the state stresses that it did not, it was nothing as bad as "the
     `pervasive,' `flagrant,' `widespread,' and `rampant' discrimination
     that originally justified preclearance in 1965." So as long as Texas
     skies aren't alight with flames from burning crosses, what's the big
     whoop?

   So, according to this, Texas is arguing that Section 2, and in fact the
   entire reasons for preclearance are all based on conditions in 1965.
   And that since "things are better than in 1965" then Section 2 is null
   and void.

   I think the fact that Texas is second only to Mississippi in Section 2
   lawsuits is the basis for this particular argument.

   However, there is a danger here.  Texas is arguing that ONLY conditions
   that existed in 1965 would justify Federal supervision of the elections
   process.  Sort of like an "originalism to the extreme" argument.

   And that can be dangerous because there are those on the Supreme Court
   that would like nothing more than the total eradication of the Voting
   Rights Act.

   Not to mention the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments, but that's another
   story.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Redistricting for purely partisan advantage isn't itself prohibited by
   the VRA.  In theory, if you had a state with no minority voters at all,
   a Republican (or Democratic) legislature could draw the districts in a
   way that would maximize the ruling party's chances of winning.  It's
   hard-ball, partisan politics, but it's legal.

   What will likely make this tricky is that by disadvantaging Democrats
   in Texas, the legislature is also disproportionately disadvantaging
   minority voters.  I'm not an expert in the VRA, so I don't know how
   this will play out.

   My only point is that redistricting for partisan advantage isn't
   something that's currently legally prohibited by the VRA.  Perhaps it
   should be, but it isn't.

     The department can still use Section 3 of the act to get states or
     cities back into its jurisdiction, allowing it to judge election
     changes. To do so, though, it must show clear intent of racial
     discrimination, which is easy to hide. Congress should revise that
     section to allow coverage when a state makes a voting change with a
     disparate racial impact, not just discriminatory intent.

       Partisan gerrymandering is in theory unconstitutional. Davis v.
       Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109 (1986). However, the burden of proof is
       usually extremely high for those challenging the districts: they
       have to show that partisan considerations "were applied in an
       invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate
       legislative objective." Vieth v. Jubilerer, 541 U.S. 267, 307
       (2004) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Basically, the challenger must
       prove that the legislature drew the lines with the primary purpose
       of partisan gain.
       This is where Texas may actually lose: if Abbott argues that the
       purpose was to disenfranchise Democrats rather than racial
       minorities, then he's essentially admitting that the districts were
       drawn primarily for partisan gain. This contrasts with prior cases
       in which the legislators were able to claim some other "legitimate"
       purpose.

       This is from the [773]DOJ's Voting Rights Act page on Section 5 of
       the VRA:

     Section 5 provides two methods for a covered jurisdiction to comply
     with Section 5. The first method mentioned in the statute is by
     means of a declaratory judgment action filed by the covered
     jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of
     Columbia. A three-judge panel is convened in such cases. The
     defendant in these cases is the United States or the Attorney
     General, represented in court by attorneys from the Voting Section
     of the Civil Rights Division. Appeals from decisions of the
     three-judge district court go directly to the United States Supreme
     Court.

     The jurisdiction must establish that the proposed voting change
     "does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying
     or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color or
     [membership in a language minority group]." The status of a voting
     change that is the subject of a declaratory judgment review action
     is that it is unenforceable until the declaratory judgment action is
     obtained and the jurisdiction may not implement or use the voting
     change.
       Emphasis added.
       We have to see what will happen with Section 2 cases, since that
       will now become the key section.  I would hope that the Supreme
       Court would use the same standard as with Section 5.  The burden
       shifts, of course, but the legal standard should be the same.

       of Texas law is to disenfranchise Democrats may not violate the
       VRA, but it certainly is a statement against interest which may be
       used as a cudgel in an equal protection clause based action.
       Secondly, a cursory scientific analysis of the Democratic
       constituency in Texas would demonstrate a high percentage of
       minority voters, ergo the plan to "disenfranchise Democrats" is
       substantively a criminal conspiracy to disenfranchise minority
       voters, which brings back VRA.

       As soon as I read that appeals go directly to SCOTUS, my heart
       sank.  Not much chance that the actions will get held up long
       enough to keep the 2014 races from falling under the weight of this
       change.  If DOJ could keep the case in litigation until then, it's
       possible -- barely -- that there could be a re-terraforming of the
       legislatures that would abort the changes before the court cases
       could be discharged.  But with them being on the fast track to
       SCOTUS, that's not likely.  The wheels of justice grind slowly, but
       they don't have far to go.

   received, but if I remember correctly, wasn't the Texas redistricting
   farce one that ended up un court and got upheld or modified because of
   lack of evidence of partisan bias?  I may be wrong here, as there are
   so many of these cases, but if so, do we have a judicial admission of
   wrongdoing?

   Sadly, he is perfectly right. Partisan gerrymandering is 100% legal.
   And ever since Mobile v. Bolden (1980), in order to be considered
   discriminatory, gerrymandering must purposely disfranchise people on
   the base of race. So long as they can claim it's just a happy
   coincidence that all those black people can't vote for democrats, its
   all above board. Basically, all they have to say is, "No your honor, we
   aren't discriminating because they are black; we're discriminating
   because they're democrats" and they are in the clear. (I can rant for
   hours about that case. )

   Although one could ask why they are redistricting now, when they don't
   have to do so for another seven years, that's a legal moot point.

 ...welcome... ([816]0+ / 0-)
       ...you are absolutely correct. Gerrymandering was created
       specifically to discriminate against members of political
       parties...not their race, gender, religion or sexual orientation.
       It would be impossible to prove to the satisfaction of the court
       that any of these reasons were why a district was gerrymandered the
       way it is.
       Having said that, the last election was the first time the party
       who got the most votes across the land...and in specific states did
       NOT gain control of the House. For this reason alone, there needs
       to be a change in gerrymandering. I believe it should NOT be
       something that allows for the control of the Federal Government by
       the minority party...as it has now become.
       Gerrymandering should be gotten rid of. In California a
       "non-partisan" group decided what the new districts would be. They
       did it based upon population and not specifically by what party
       controlled what county. So it actually favored the Democrats a bit
       more because California is so overwhelmingly Democrats. In other
       words, it made the district really more representative of the
       population and not as favorable to the minority party.
       I can live with gerrymandering that affects a state's internal
       politics...but NOT the way it controls national politics for the
       minority party...

       instead of having to honk out scales on the damn thing :)

   resident relocated from New England, I can say with all honesty and
   balance that the state government and Congressional reps are crazy.
   For every Grayson we have five Buchanans and other crooks and crazies.
    Down here, the local paper has 3-4 letters to the editor a day that
   make Batshit crazy Bachman look almost sane.  The Chamber of Commerce
   almost got an office in City Hall for a dollar a year in my city, while
   actively lobbying the City Commission.  So, to all you Texans who get
   upset at our generalized dumping on Texas, please understand that the
   same applies to our own state.  I've been through many states, and seen
   and got to know many people from all over the world, and I have to say,
   certain places seem to either attract or grow concentrations of the
   dumb.  Panhandle Florida is such a place, as is Duval County, Florida
   (otherwise known as Southern Georgia by the inhabitants).

     Cojones (Spanish pronunciation: [ko|xones]) is a Spanish word for
     denoting courage when used in the phrase "tener cojones" (equivalent
     to English "have the balls to") or testicles. It is considered a
     curse word when used by itself as an expletive in Spanish. In
     English, as a loanword, it means courage, brazenness, "nerve" etc.

     In US slang, cojones denotes "brazen, brave attitude", pronounced
     k@|hoUneIz and k@|hu:n@z in English. Contextually, its usage is like
     that of the Yiddish chutzpah (nerve), ...

       no Constitutional right to vote.  Don't remember much about why,
       but I've seen that stated.  Much like there is no true right to
       privacy spelled out in the Constitution.  Implied, yes, but not
       actually spelled out with that quill pen.
       The next argument could be that those who are members of the
       Republican party are allowed into polling places up to a month in
       advance, while those registered as Democrats, Greens, Independents
       or Commies can only vote if they're in line between 1:10 and 1:12PM
       on the prescribed voting day - no absentee ballots, no allowance
       for voting machine problems, no allowance for any difference in
       your watch versus the Republican Supervisor of Elections' official
       timepiece.  Because, following their logic, Democrats don't have an
       official right to vote.  That the Republicans choose to allow them
       to (if they follow the above "guidelines") is because Republicans
       are generous and considerate of those less fortunate.

   no right to vote for certain offices.  There is no inherent federal
   Constitutional right to vote for your mayor or city council members
   (see e.g. Detroit).  There is no inherent federal Constitutional right
   to elections that are determinative on state laws via referenda as is
   so popular in rural and Western states.  State constitutions are much
   more detailed than the federal constitution and often the right to vote
   in those circumstances can be found in a state constitution, in whole
   or in part.

   Furthermore, when the vote is provided for, either voluntarily  (see
   e.g. mayoral elections) or by Constitutional obligation (and I can no
   longer remember which federal offices require a vote), the vote must be
   conducted in a Constitutional fashion, which puts it under the purview
   of the 5th and 14th Amendments and the various acts that serve to
   enforce the 5th and 14th Amendments, yatta yatta.

   So the "no Constitutional right to vote" claims start with a small
   kernel of truth but usually are made in defense of some state action
   that is violative of another Constitutional right.

   Normally, partisan gerrymanders survive judicial scrutiny because those
   challenging the redistricting have to prove that partisan gain is the
   primary purpose. It's hard to prove that because the majority party can
   usually point to other "legitimate" factors and claim that they were
   the primary considerations.

   However, this makes Abbott's argument especially weak: by arguing that
   the primary purpose was not racial but partisan, he may defeat a Voting

   Equal Protection Clause challenge.

   But doesn't their own argument sow the seeds of their own demise
   (legally)?  I mean, if they are claiming that the are not
   discriminating against minorities, but rather discriminating against
   Democrats - then doesn't one have to show that it would be difficult
   for a minority to vote for a Republican to legally blow their argument?

   there is very little difference between those two as - since a

   vote for Democrats - they are essentially killing two birds with one

   rather than a fake majority from distorted districting.  Equal should
   mean that each vote should count equally toward representation.  In
   other words, the whole representative body should be made up via a
   system that makes each voter's vote as equal as possible in
   representative effect.

       Gerrymandering can certainly be construed as a form of group-level
       disenfranchisement -- but not in the sense of preventing anyone
       from voting. So, while the story is interesting and worthwhile, the
       headline is misleading.

   highly correlated with deliberate highly partisan gerrymandering? Have
   they run correlations analyses, or are they doing the usual, talking
   out of their ass to confirm their own racist beliefs.

   Besides, what does gerrymandering have to do with election laws that
   target minorities.  The two have synergistic effects, yes, but they are
   mostly unrelated . . .  other than the intended partisan effect, of
   course. Do they even listen to what they say.  They admit effects, but
   brush them off as incidental,  just b/c.

   what if everybody in Texas registered as Republicans, and then voted
   Democratic? That would throw a monkey wrench in their redistricting,
   wouldn't it? Registering GOP also means you get to pick the candidate.
   Might be the shortest path to dumping the Tea Party and moving the

 The author is spouting bullshit. ([1912]0+ / 0-)

   Democrats can still vote in Texas. They just won't have the
   disingenuous convenience of gerrymandered districts to vote in. You
   want to elect people? Convince enough Texans that your message is worth
   it, and then run candidates in those districts you want to challenge
   republicans in. End of story. For a bunch of people that play extreme
   hardball politics, there is sure a lot of whining going on.

   You have a constitutionally protected right to vote (assuming you're a
   citizen). You don't have a constitutionally guaranteed right to a
   mandated X number of "safe" districts.

   Back when democrats had the overwhelming majority in Texas politics
   (not that long ago, go look it up), democrats had no problem at all
   screwing over republicans. Turnabout IS fair play, even if you don't
   like it. And when republicans finally got the upper hand and started
   redisctricting back circa 2000, democrats got their undies in a twist
   and fled the state so that they wouldn't have to face the political
   music that THEY created. Flippin' crybabies.

   And by the way, I'm not a republican. I'm a libertarian, and we have
   MUCH bigger hurdles to overcome in Texas politics than democrats do,
   and you don't hear US whining about it. Buncha pussies. I just call's
   'em like I sees 'em. Don't like it? Grow some.

 The Worst Thing About Living in a Red State... ([1938]0+ / 0-)

   ...is knowing that at least every other voting age-person that you
   meet, or who is within sight of you at any given time, is committed to
   bigotry to some degree. Or else is frightfully ignorant.  Because any
   person who votes Republican is voting for the party that is absolutely
   dedicated to eroding and/or destroying human & civil rights, and
   personal liberties.

       That said, I often remind my friends and neighbors of this (and the
   quotation is my own) --

         Congress and state legislatures have become tragically adept at
     eroding human and civil rights, and neither party is blameless in
     that.  So you need to ask yourself this question before casting your
     ballot at the polls: "Since some injury to them appears inevitable,
     and some wounds take longer to heal than others, would I rather have
     my personal liberties kicked by a spooked 300-pound donkey or
     trampled by an enraged six-ton elephant?"
