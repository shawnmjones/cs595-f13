Case closed: the stimulus worked

   CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf

   Among Republicans, it's taken as a given that President Obama's
   Recovery Act -- a.k.a., the "stimulus" -- was a failed Keynesian
   experiment. Among many voters, it's also widely assumed that the effort
   to get the economy back on track simply did not work.

   Among those who know what they're talking about, however, there is no
   real doubt that the stimulus was a success. Douglas Elmendorf, the
   director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, [3]reminded
   Congress of this inconvenient truth yesterday.

     Did the stimulus work? Certainly not according to Republicans, who
     regularly blast President Obama's "failed" economic policies on the
     campaign trail. GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney has called
     the $787 billion package of temporary tax cuts and spending hikes
     "the largest one-time careless expenditure of government money in
     American history."

     But on Wednesday, under questioning from skeptical Republicans, the
     director of the nonpartisan (and widely respected) Congressional
     Budget Office was emphatic about the value of the 2009 stimulus.
     And, he said, the vast majority of economists agree.

     In a survey conducted by the University of Chicago Booth School of
     Business, 80 percent of economic experts agreed that, because of the
     stimulus, the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010
     than it would have been otherwise.

   The truth matters, not simply as a political exercise in which partisan
   players point fingers and thump their chests, but for entirely
   practical reasons.

   For one thing, there's the question of credibility and accountability.
   In 2009, the American economy stood on the brink of a catastrophic
   collapse. Some proposed solutions that made sense (in this case,
   Democrats) and some proposed solutions that were ridiculous
   (congressional Republicans wanted a five-year spending freeze). Who got
   this right and who got it wrong helps us understand who we should
   listen to now and in the near future.

   For another, on a substantive/policy-driven level, there's value in
   knowing what worked and what didn't when it came to making the economy
   stronger. It's common sense -- if, given certain economic conditions, a
   Keynesian fiscal stimulus worked, we should do more of it. If it made
   things worse, we should do less of it.

   And I've got some charts that help separate fact from fiction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Here, for example, is a chart showing the nation's GDP before and after
   the stimulus. Note, once the stimulus kicked in, the economy
   immediately started growing.

   Here's a chart showing private-sector job growth before and after the
   stimulus. Note, once the stimulus kicked in, job growth immediately
   improved.

   And here's a chart showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average before and
   after the stimulus. See that low point in March 2009? That's just
   before the stimulus kicked in.

   Now, a Republican might look at this and argue, "Yeah, but the gains
   didn't last." That's true; they didn't. In the spring of 2010, the
   Eurozone debt crisis rattled international markets and through the
   global economy a curve ball. The U.S. gains quickly stalled, right
   around the time the stimulus funds started to wane. In 2011, unrest in
   the Middle East, coupled with a Japanese tsunami and Eurozone
   austerity, provided more global troubles.

   But that's not an argument against the stimulus; it's an argument for
   more stimulus. The most accurate criticism of the Recovery Act comes
   from the left -- it was too small.

   In a political/electoral context, Mitt Romney and congressional
   Republicans would have Americans believe President Obama's 2009
   policies made the economy "worse." The challenge, then, is having
   Romney and his allies explain how, exactly, their argument lines up
   with reality.

   The economy was failing, then the Recovery Act started spending, then
   conditions quickly improved. In GOP minds, how is that possible? Was it
   magic? Was it a coincidence? How do they explain why every relevant
   economic metric showed sharp improvements immediately after Obama's
   stimulus took effect?

   That's not a rhetorical question; I genuinely want to know.

   As a secondary question, if every relevant economic metric showed sharp
   improvements immediately after Obama's stimulus took effect, why in the
   world should we avoid taking similar steps right now?

   Look here, as any republican knows-the truth is a mere deception
   designed to remove doubt so as to make propaganda useless. In resorting
   to such tactics as facts and figures the left proves they are a
   hopeless bunch of dreamers who think rather than feel or believe. We
   must fight this assault on our beliefs lest we lose our freedom to
   ignore science and reality. Uh I mean...

   I see lots of studies stating the stimulus worked. Did it work in
   eliminating the threat or did it prolong the inevitable?

   I would love to see a study in what would have happened if the
   government didn't prop up the jail worthy financial institutions. So we
   would have been trading for goods and services with potatoes for awhile
   (some are already in that boat). Where would we be now, almost four
   years later? Would we have already gone through the worst, bottomed
   out, and now working and progressing far beyond where we are at now?

   What would have happened without stimulus and the Federal Reserve
   printing money? 1929-1933 would have happened: a depression worsened by
   compounded deflation and government spending cuts. The same happened in
   1937, when FDR prematurely decided to start cutting spending in order
   to curb the deficit. The economy is driven by money circulating between
   different sectors, and the government is and always has been a big and
   important sector--especially since they are the only body authorized to
   print currency (through the Fed, at this point.)

   Without it, we would all be living in literal poverty today, except for
   the wealthiest among us, and some thieves.

   As a side note, TARP was also necessary, but it was handled extremely
   poorly.

   I'm really tired of folks (mostly on the Left, but with plenty on the
   Right as well) making garbage statements like "Case Closed" or the
   "Debate is settled".

   If the $timula$$ worked (and don't get it too twisted, I put W's TARP
   bailout in the same category) why is the TRUE unemployment rate still
   so high?? Why is a trip to the gas station, supermarket, "stuporcenter"
   or other retail outlet painful??

   You people have no idea what you are talking about. EVERY economic
   downturn comes at the back end of a credit catalyzed economic boom. Low
   interest rates drive up a "false demand" in the market place until
   growth has outpaced demand more quickly than investors realize they are
   overextended.

   Interestingly enough, the exact same mechanisms that were in place
   which caused the current financial crisis are STILL in place. The Fed
   is still driving Interest rates lower than ever (below 4% for a 30 year
   fixed), sub-prime loans are alive and well thriving in the form of FHA
   loans, and derivatives have not yet been reigned in. I would like
   someone to tell me how any bailout would work under these conditions.

   The Keynesian bailouts don't work because a fundamental principle is
   being ignored which is basic energetics. Regardless of whether or not
   the bailout would have been effective (and it wouldn't have) is beside
   the point. The underlying problem is not which political party is in
   power (a lie the powers that be need you to believe) or which economic
   schemes will be most effective, the problem is our culture has been
   permeated and saturated by corruption. No one is responsible,
   accountable, or ethical. No system will thrive under these
   circumstances.

   While the Republi-Crats are redirecting the focus of the citizenry on
   the issues that divide this nation, most of us are ignoring the issues
   that these two seemingly separate organization into one special
   interest group.

   Maddow and anyone else who divides the issues into a convoluted
   Democrat vs. Republican argument is implicit. Anyone who follows these
   types are fools.

   As I have said before, here.

   FDR used Keynesian stimulus to get us out of the depression. It was
   never enough until WWII was seen on the horizon and France and England
   started to rearm and placed orders in the US for weapons. Then the war
   started, more orders. Then US started to rearm too.

   Finally the depression ended. So my take on this is-- if a little
   stimulus is not working-- add more, and more and more, until it does
   work.

   Also, the 1% (or is it 1/10th of 1%) seem to want the 99% to to suffer
   with less (and less and less) while they get more (and more and more).
   This is their idea of shared sacrifice. I say if they want me to have
   less and less, I want them to join me in my misery. This is my idea of
   shared sacrifice.

   So I understand you correctly Steve, you believe that Keynesian
   stimulus money the taxpayers (i.e us, i.e the 99%) must finance to
   cover the unscrupulous business practices of the individuals who put
   the nation in this position [i.e. the 1% (or is it 1/10 of 1%)] even
   though they (the 1%) want the rest of us (the 99%) to suffer with less?

   Clearly they are not alone in wanting to share the sacrifice. Have you
   ever heard the phrase "public risk, private profits" or "transfer of
   wealth?" Fraud, AIG bonuses, PNC purchase of National City... It
   doesn't appear you have thought this through. If you want them to join
   you in misery then why bail them out? Why not put your money where your
   mouth is, man up, and stop consuming from these monsters?

   I really think your contempt and envy has clouded your logic.

   Anyone that doesn't believe the bulk of the Stimulus money didn't go to
   the same institutions that helped create this mess would do well with a
   little number crunching.

   What did it cost the taxpayer? 250k-500k per 30k-50k a year job
   created. Where do you think the rest of the money went?

   With these kind of statistics, how can they call this a success?

   Not envy, but contempt is present, but not clouding judgement. The
   stimulus is for hiring people, not for bank bailouts. TARP was what you
   are talking about.

   The taxpayers are already being affected by low revenues due to
   underemployment. The stimulus is for working people to spend money to
   buy products and services for overall economy, not to be hoarded by
   unscrupulous businesses. Besides, the Republicans are mostly protecting
   those that are sending jobs away from the U.S., when this stimulus goes
   toward roads that are here in our country.

   The Republicans want to spend money in other countries to prop them up,
   but the infrastructure is here. We have people in need of jobs here.

   I must conclude the stimulus is opposed because some folks do not want
   economic recovery for political reasons?

   Aren't we tired yet of betting for foreclosures and unemployment? How
   about trying to get something going for more people to buy a car and
   hire folks to put in flooring, buy some new clothes, maybe have meals
   in a restaurant or whatever?

   I want everyone to do well, and there is no envy. Do not believe that

   @ Teresa,

   I do not know what you mean.

   Tarp was done by Bush II, not Obama. The banks were already bailed out
   when he took office.

   In so far as the stimulus was badly crafted, blame the Repubs in
   Congress, not Obama.

   You post failed to respond to the "shared sacrifice" part.

   @ Steve

   "...I want them to join me in my misery." That statement speaks volumes
   Steve. That is what I mean. I am as angry as anyone else regarding the
   level of corruption in our culture, but my personal philosophy is not
   to have others join me in my misery. You are a crab in a bucket.

   My personal philosophy is to take ownership of MY OWN LIFE. We as a
   family are working extremely hard to improve our own lives and we teach
   our children to take responsibility and ownership for THEIR OWN LIVES
   and to do their best to improve the lives of others around them.

   As far as shared responsibility, what is your suggestion? The 99% is
   just as much at fault as the 1% because we have taken part in this
   gluttonous lifestyle. You assign blame as if it is this some childish
   good vs evil scenario.

   I do think Bush and the GOP are responsible; I blame Obama because he
   is continues to dig the financial hole deeper; I blame mega banks for
   their exotic lending schemes; I blame Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
   because they invented these mortgage back securities; I blame people
   who bought more home or shiny new things than they could afford; I
   blame the people who thought they were money savvy and used their new
   found equity for business investments.

   You seem to argue from the position that if one side is at fault, the
   other is not. Try not to forget that Congress controlled the majority
   in both chambers. There were some honest legislators on both sides that
   wanted nothing to do with the bailout. Ultimately, both parties voted
   for it. If you would actually read both of my posts you would see that
   I do blame both parties and I think the only real difference between
   the two parties is the political gimmicks that the intellectually
   shallow bite on like bait. The difference between me and you is I blame
   BOTH. Corruption is not bound by political affiliation Steve. If you
   really believe that then you need to grow up.

   Or just join me in the lake, the water is fine.

   Theresa, FDH,

   I would ask those that seem bent on blaming Obama to explain
   specifically what Mitt Romney would do to create jobs.

   We have all heard about tax cuts creating jobs, but it obviously isn't
   working. Address the jobs, specifically. Corps are too busy donating to
   tax cutters and EPA and union haters (how else do we make people stop
   dumping chemicals in water, etc.?). How can Mitt do better to create
   jobs, when the entire nation would seem to be concerned about jobs, not
   same sex marriage, not abortion, not what the Catholic Church feels
   laws should be, not what any church or religious institution thinks,
   JOBS. Numero uno issue is jobs and Republicans are more interested in
   "winning elections" to even allow a jobs bill.

   The debt? Nobody was talking debt while a Republican was President and
   debt running up.

   You try to steer conversation, but elude the real important stuff that
   voters want: jobs. Trickle down is such b.s., we know "job creators"
   are consumers, consumers need income. Corps seem bent on cutting
   incomes for workers and increase their own. Same with taxes. Cut
   working persons' jobs to keep their tax rates low- yes they are low.
   Cutting off OUR economy by cutting jobs.

   This talk about both parties are bad is trying to get more voter
   apathy. Might as well give up, is that it? We need more people involved
   and accurately informed, not less.

   Sandy,

   Notice there is no h in the name Teresa. That seems to be the spelling
   variant that many people seem to default to. This is not much different
   than defaulting to political or social opinions.

   We are supposed to ask those kind of questions to all candidates so I
   agree with you. I don't trust Romney because is blatantly dishonest and
   inconsistent. I hope you are not assuming I am in the Romney camp.

   I also agree the economy is the critical issue. You say the Republicans
   are more interested in winning elections... I agree. But if you claim
   that the Democratic party is above this I would ask you why they are so
   different.

   The debt. The left complained that Bush was running up the debt while
   the right was silent or justifying it because the Repub party appealed
   to their values . The Right was complaining while Obama has run up the
   debt while the left sits silent or justifies it because the Dems
   appealed to their values. I am standing pointing out the debt created
   by both. What is the problem with this?

   Pointing out the fundamental which is corruption is not about apathy,
   its about identifying the problem. Cherry picking problems based on

   I want to know what Romney would do and discuss more specifics.

   I was in the none of the above camp until I realized that we have a two
   party system and we must steer the two because having only yes or no.

   So, you are calling Republicans cherry pickers for switching focus on
   debt instead of jobs?

   I do not see how saying both parties are bad is going to be of any
   effect. I do see corruption (mostly Republican), but we can't just pull
   the plug and start over.

   I'm all for discussions, but I have seen quite a bit of trying to say
   it's useless because all are bad. The result is more apathy. We need

   Sandy.

   I would just like to say good job on the commenting and I agree with
   most of what you say about both parties stinking gets us nowhere.

   The problem I have with voting for Obama is the fact he cannot get
   anything done with the Congress he has been presented and whether his
   fault or not it is HIS job to move forward and stop pointing fingers.
   President Clinton had to deal with the evils of people like Newt
   Gingrich and Tip O'Neal and was still able to get meaningful
   legislation completed. Obama has failed miserably in this area when the
   country needs a government that works so desperately.

   I totally agree the system is broke and both parties are to blame. Even
   though an insider my candidate of choice in 2008 was Hillary Clinton. I
   liked the way she talked and believe she could have gotten things done.
   This year my candidate of choice is Buddy Rohmer, a Republican. He is a
   straight shooter and says things that make sense. Problem with him is
   he's more of a third party candidate and that just won't work right
   now, hopefully soon.

   Although Romney may not be the answer, he deserves a chance and I
   suspect with his willingness to bend will get lots more done than this
   president ever will.

   FDH, I understand the Hillary statement but I believe she would face as
   much or more resistance. I like her and respect her. I do not think the
   Congress would be more cooperative with Hillary, as the Congress is
   apparently more focused upon their own power and status than the well
   being of the country as a whole.

   I think Obama deserves a second term and the Congress being the people
   that are resisting the policies of an overwhelmingly elected president,
   the Congress should change majority.

   Roemer seems like a good man, but I am definitely not leaning toward
   the Republican platform, not to mention the T.P. that influence them
   into wildly radical things like the debt ceiling being the whole
   problem, not understanding default is worse. The interest rate is bad
   enough as it is, causing debt to flounder longer. I want to turn tax
   rates back to Clinton era tax rates and cut MIC spending.

   That's the part I don't get about the Democratic platform, when it has
   been proved over and over again that tax increases is like dropping a
   Bounty paper towel into the ocean of debt. The debt and deficit
   spending is just too enormous.

   Government spending money they don't have, especially with all the
   exposed fraud, abuse, redundant programs, and inefficiencies, is
   absolutely insane and sometimes it takes the threat of insane acts,
   like creating a debt ceiling, to combat insanity.

   I really believe most people, including the rich, wouldn't mind a tax
   increase, especially temporary, if the government cut spending where it
   could without hurting those in need, first. The problem is the taxes
   always seem to be increased in these types of situations with broken
   promises of spending cuts that never materialize.

   Sandy,

   I think honest and open discussion is the only way to go. One liner
   opinionated responses based solely on beliefs and pre-concepts are
   useless if not destructive.

   During the 2008 campaign I was optimistic about Romney, but he has
   proven to me he is a quintessential double talking politician. I think
   Obama is as well. I am baffled that so many people are cynical about
   these types yet continue empowering them.

   Last election I walked out of the voting booth (literally) feeling sick
   because I voted for a person I felt was the lesser (if only minutely)
   of the two evils. I didn't like either candidate at all. This time
   around I will vote my conscious.

   Based on your statements, you don't appear to be very intimidated or
   concerned by the ever growing debt. For me, its important to understand
   your viewpoint on this matter. Jobs and the magnitude of debt are
   inherently linked.

   I personally stand with the Republicans on drawing a line in the sand
   on the debt ceiling. I can't imagine anyone posting messages on this
   blog using this method as a means to support their own families. Going
   deeper into debt to pay debt while maintaining ones lifestyle is
   fundamentally no different than relying credit cards, signature or
   worse, payday loans as a way to stay afloat. The reckoning will come
   sooner or later in the form of out of control debt, collections, or
   bankruptcy if one will not change the way they manage their money.

   Regarding cherry picking and blaming both sides. It's not about
   assigning blame, finger pointing or giving up, it is about trying to
   open up honest discussion in order to identify a fundamental problem
   which has more to do with character than econ/political philosophy. I
   was referring to anyone who only points out the faults of their
   opponents while ignoring the mistakes or transgressions of their
   cohorts because. This is the key recipe of dysfunction and failure in
   any relationship from marriage to corporate. How much more successful
   would these relationships be if each individual is capable of admitting
   fault in themselves or those that they support.

   Well, I guess we will wait and see.

   The assumption that the TARP bailout was equivalent to stimulus because
   they are creating debt is not accurate. The bailout was for the people
   that caused the real estate failure. Who helped those folks out? The
   federal backing of loans were viewed as a free for all to take too much
   risk without regard to the known default probablility. The private
   sector is reliant upon government and also seem to be holding out
   hands. The creation of conditions were due to deregulation while
   passing out home loans to risks. Then unscrupulous people scammed the
   system to create even larger housing bubble. I cannot look away from
   the fact that the bank bailouts occurred, but those banks were merged
   to create even less competition and the borrowers were left holding the
   bag. No way out for them. At least something has come out to refinance,
   but the false ballooning of real estate value was out of control.

   I personally am watching it play out in my family. I can't find any way
   to help a woman with adult children (whose father is remarried and new
   family-not helping even his other children). She was one who was given
   a loan when all that was going down. She had a manufacturing job.
   Facing the impending loss of her job, she was diagnosed with breast
   cancer. Well, the company let her go after that. Nice, huh? Well, she
   survived, but infection cause her to be hospitalized frequently. She
   has totally run out of money. We pay her medical insurance. Her mother
   sends some money. She is probably behind in mort. payments, because she
   can't shake the infections to get even a Mickey D's job. Her arm is
   always swollen and cannot use it much. She applied for SS disability,
   but it will be 6 mos, to a year before a response for any income. She
   can get food at churches now and then. Her house is way under water, so
   selling it would only leave her (and her daughter) completely homeless.
   I visualize her moving here or with her mother some day. My brother was
   in a similar situation, but no health insurance. Well, he died in April
   (probably because he had no health insurance-delayed health care), so I
   am no longer worried about him becoming homeless. I paid for his burial
   (I am living on 401K-retired) and my mother (widow) paid for his casket
   and mortuary fees. Multiply these stories by millions and that is where
   I am coming from in regard to being a humanist and not a corporatist.

   Yes, emotional approach, so sue me. I believe in helping people and
   education would be a way to pull up by bootstraps, but Republicans want
   to cut it for debt, rather than return to tax *60's or even 90's rates.
   The pension funds were raided by venture capitalists to enrich the
   already rich.

   That is where I am coming from.

   Balance is needed, we agree. I do not advocate dependence on
   government, either by private enterprise, or humans. The thing that was
   done for excessive greed has come back to bite us all. We would be
   better off regulating more and denying home loans to people without
   down payment. Perhaps veterans should be given special status, but the
   risks taken were catastrophic because they were allowed to do this,
   even encouraged to do this. I was told for many years, you need to save
   up a down payment before we loan you money, even though I had a great
   job.

   Well people HAD jobs, but the mergers and deregulation, trade
   agreements need to be made to get us back on track. Jobs with higher
   revenues coming in would also close the budget gap faster. Hence, I
   would prioritize jobs first, tax rates go up for higher incomes, cut
   spending. I never said not to cut spending, but I believe the that some
   folks are trying to solve the problem by cutting more jobs. I believe
   jobs should NOT be cut now, the debt interest rate is also crushing, so
   why push for higher interest on top of it all?

   But we cannot have any movement to jobs, let alone green jobs. There
   will still be coal producers and oil producers, but we want to open up
   the renewable energy.

   That should explain my views. I long for the days where employers
   valued employees and customers because of the simpatico relationship
   that makes it all work. Privatizing federal, state and municipal jobs
   does not cut costs, now there is a profit aspect, so it would cost
   more.

   Thanks for the exchange, but I cannot ignore the real human suffering
   aspect to protect the troubled tax rates of millionaires. That is where
   I am coming from.

   That was a great response Sandy! I have to commend you for investing in
   the life of another family. We should all be invested in the lives of
   others; there is little point otherwise.

   I really do agree with much of your statement (with an exception or
   two). I think when we can get passed the defensive or offensive
   exterior of our opinions, we agree on more things than we disagree. I
   think most of us agree that there is a real problem and many of us
   would agree on what has caused the problem. The disagreement seems to
   come when trying to find the solution to the problem.

   It's easy to ignore the human aspect of a political issue unless you
   have directly witness other people's hardships, but we can't ignore the
   macro either. This is an issue which obviously requires balance.

   So where am I coming from? As a person educated in science I always
   tend to view problems and solutions from a basic energetics standpoint.
   In fact, many of my beliefs, concepts and opinions have disappeared as
   a result of my education. I think when energetics is considered, many
   opinions pertaining to social, political, or economic issues get
   exposed as little more than red herrings.

   never they use it every day to prove the libs wrong. In the world of
   science a survey is considered the least accurate and least scientific
   way to gather data, just look at exit polls and actuality, not even
   close to the scientific margin of error. why?

   I love how Maddow gives reference to a servey and gives no back ground.
   To somebody that has any research back ground, it means nothing.

   Maddow loves to use facts and half truths to forward her agenda. For
   example: Rachel uses the fact that during her life time 3 Republican
   presidents have reduced taxes and during that same time the deficit
   increased. She claims that lowing the taxes was the direct reason form
   increased deficit, claiming tax breaks won't stimulate the economy. She
   purposely leaves out two other numbers that fall in between taxes and
   deficit. Those are revenues to the government and spending by the
   government.

   This is the part where she is Lying to you by telling you only part of
   the information. Under all three Presidents that reduced taxes,
   revenues to the government INCREASED. ( For you slow people that means
   that even with reducing the percentage of money taken by the government
   the amount payed to the government increased). The reason that the
   deficit increased was because of the 3rd number ( government spending)
   increased faster than the revenues to the government causing a net
   deficit increase.

   So Maddow uses PART of the truth to miss lead you and decieve you.

   That said, if you Righties expected the Stimulus to prop up the economy
   entirely, you're preaching Communism. The Stimulus was a stop-gap for
   job loss, and an energizing force on the economy. The private sector
   was supposed to kick in and do their part, but they are a) watching
   Europe part deux, and b) turning down deb-ridden applicants because of

   Instead, we are still, and not at an economic point of moving forward.

   It doesn't have to bust the budget. Here is the answer: Tax and spend.

   I am totally serious. The problem we have is not that there isn't
   enough money in the system. There is plenty of money. The problem is
   that the velocity of money has dropped off a cliff.

   The conservatives are right about one thing. Government collected taxes
   will go through and be spent like (ahem) food through a goose. That
   money, spent in the economy, will act as a stimulus, particularly if
   investments in education and infrastructure are made. In turn, the
   people who are paid those dollars will spend - and businesses will need
   to hire to satisfy the demand. Why? Because money is moving faster
   through the economy.

   Tax cuts have not proven to stimulate the economy because the
   government bonds that were issued are sitting idle. Tax and spend
   policies would be the stimulus this economy needs. All you have to do
   is to let the Bush tax cuts expire... All of them.

   Example, on "Secrets of the Dead" several years ago they had a show
   about how maybe the witch mania in Europe and Salem was partially a
   response to food poisoning.

   It said that rye for rye bread has a fungus that grows on it more in
   wet years. This fungus is hard to separate from the rye seeds and so it
   gets milled into the rye flour and baked into the bread. The fungus
   contains LSD and other poisons that cause muscle cramps, etc. The show
   claimed that there was a thousands of years old folk tradition that
   witches were causing the visions/hallucinations and other symptoms,
   when in fact it was food poisoning from tainted rye flour after a wet
   year's harvest.

   The show claimed that they grew rye in Salem and further pointed to a
   specific field where it was grown and claimed there was evidence that
   the people who got the symptoms would have eaten rye flour from that
   field, etc.

   Wow, the comment thread for the article is "Chock full-o-Nuts"! I find
   it interesting the a mental-minority can continue to deny so much and
   still drive the narrative in every aspect of media outlet. Opinions are
   facts and facts are garbage. It's extraordinarily sad what has become
   of the country I was born into; they used to call China the "sleeping
   giant", they now might likewise call America the "Giant Retard"!

   So let's see, the stimulus stalled out due to "outside" factors, but
   outside factors were not in play during the improvement?

   Now I realize Ed sits behind a microphone all day and does not have a
   background in economics, but please. This is as hollow an arguement as
   you can get. what abouth the Fed pumping money into the economy?
   Suppose thathad any effect? Really what is the answer to that?

   Of course $787 billion can create jobs, but the probloem here is that
   they were temporary jobs and what cost to the future? These jobs are
   not around still, even the President made the statement "We found out
   there weren't that many shovel ready jobs around".

   The point is you can spin #'s both ways and use several scenarios to
   say this worked or didn't work, but the end result is more debt for
   future generations period. I seem to recall a surging politician in
   2007 make the statement that piling on debt to the next generation was
   unpatriotic - I agree with him.

   It was a beginning step, never meant to not be matched by investment
   from private industry, or states to not have projects that were
   shovel-ready, or bankers to release some of the $2 Trillion so small
   business owners could start new businesses and hire, or states to make
   sure their cities, counties, and state employees would not lose their
   jobs in record numbers when the stimulus money ended.

   But, this is a political ad that needs making - just use the CBO
   Director Elmendorf and ten Americans who were hired using stimulus
   funds to say "thank you" to Democrats in Congress and the President for
   passing the FIRST stimulus. And while the DNC/OFA/DGA/DCCC/etc. are
   making these ads, perhaps they really ought to be less arrogant in
   assuming they "know better" what kind of message works best with
   America. The charts, the stories, the lies, the statements by
   Romney/surrogates about foreign intervention - all are ripe for putting
   in ads that shouldn't have to cost very much. Especially since so many
   of the big ads that have aired already have fallen flat...ya think. And
   start telling what Obama has done and WILL do. He needs to start
   talking about building on what's been started and what hasn't been
   gotten to, yet, and new ideas to be hinted at, at least. They ought to
   be talking to you folks at Maddow Blog IMO. Thanks for all you do. Keep
   it up!

   It'g going to be painful until wages increase. Once prices rise, they
   don't fall. Maybe in the short-term, as with gasoline, but in the
   long-term, price inflation doesn't tend to correct. Income rises to
   meet it where it is. Or it doesn't.
