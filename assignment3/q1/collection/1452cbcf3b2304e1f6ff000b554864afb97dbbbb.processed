Mitt manipulates math: a case study

   By [2]Steve Benen

   Thu Apr 12, 2012 8:00 AM EDT

   Yesterday, Mitt Romney and his campaign were eager, almost desperate,
   to work on narrowing the gender gap. The strategy was simple: argue
   that President Obama, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, is
   really the one waging a "war on women."

   Their efforts failed [3]rather spectacularly, thanks in large part to
   the clumsy unpreparedness of Romney's own aides. The day offered a
   reminder of an often-overlooked detail: the presumptive Republican
   nominee is accustomed to facing weak, bumbling competitors, and Team
   Romney is [4]going to have to learn quickly the differences between the
   minor leagues and the Big Show.

   But before moving on, it's worth pausing to take a closer look at the
   Romney campaign's underlying argument: 92.3% of the jobs lost in the
   Obama era have belonged to women. The claim was debunked yesterday
   [5]over and [6]over and [7]over and [8]over again yesterday, but my
   personal favorite was [9]Kevin Drum's takedown, because he included a
   chart that helped drive the point home.

   Kevin Drum, Mother Jones

   In case the image isn't self-explanatory, Team Romney took a look at
   all the job losses and gains in the American economy, starting on Jan.
   1, 2009 (three weeks before President Obama was inaugurated). The
   Republican campaign then got creative: because male workers saw a more
   sudden increase in job losses at the beginning of that calendar year,
   Romney carefully chose the starting date for his analysis that
   exaggerates the results.

   If he'd started on Feb. 1, 2009, to reflect Obama's first full month in
   office, the number for women would have been 300%, instead of 92%. The
   Romney campaign knows no one would believe such an absurd figure, so
   they manipulated the figures accordingly.

   The scope of its creativity and dishonesty is almost impressive, in a
   shameful sort of way.
     __________________________________________________________________

   As Kevin explained, "There was a steep job loss among men right at the
   beginning of the recession and a slower job loss among women. So what
   happens if you just lop off that bit of the recession and count only
   the strength of the recovery since January 1, 2009? Well, men have
   recovered steeply and women have recovered more slowly.... Men have
   made up ground faster then women since January 2009, so technically
   that means that women have sustained the bulk of the job losses since
   then."

   Romney's talking point is the kind of argument Americans would expect
   from a candidate who simply doesn't respect voters enough to be
   straight with them. The "92%" argument is a con masquerading as
   political rhetoric. That this is what Romney has been reduced to in
   April -- on the first day of the general-election phase of the race --
   does not bode well for the kind of honesty we can expect from the GOP
   campaign in the fall.

   There's a larger point to keep in mind -- when should the clock start
   when it comes to evaluating the economy under Obama? -- and I'll have
   more on that a little later this morning.

   Who, save us obsessive political junkies cruising teh internets,
   deconstructs the chicken entrails of arcane charts and figures?

   The vast majority of otherwise occupied voters will favorably respond
   to a terse, "Romney Lies- Again! Yawn."

   What was getting more play was the statement and apology about Ann

   The question in my mind is whether the 92% statistic will take votes
   away from Obama or just confirm the public impression that Romney is a
   liar and thus take votes away from him.

   till people start to believe themjust like the one where they say that
   Obama has taken some freedoms from them and nobody will say which
   freedoms have been lost,that is because they haven't lost any freedoms
   ,and if you know of a freedom, thats been taken away please tell us

   In the words of faux conservative Steven Coubert's faux lament.
   "Reality has a liberal bias." I know he meant it as a joke but I also
   think he meant it. Whenever both the conservative and the liberal take
   on an issue are examined in detail, it is usually the liberal view that
   wins out. That is why there are so many liberals in univeristies and
   why the media, if they do their job properly, have a liberal bias.

   Not that I have a bias in any way, shape, or form.

   "when should the clock start when it comes to evaluating the economy
   under Obama?"

   When Obama finally manages to dig us out of the hole left by the GOP
   AND he gets a fillibuster-proof house and senate. Only then do we have
   any hope of seeing what could have been under a progressive
   administration. Although I would have to say, given what he has to work
   with, I'm impressed. And given Rachel's fine reporting on Rethug
   governance in Michigan and Wisconsin, the day will never come when I
   will ever again vote for a GOP candidate for anything including
   janitor.

   Doesn't any claim like that need to be substantiated? For example, what
   sectors did these job losses come from? My guess is the public sector
   and under any proposals I have heard Mr. Romney state, there isn't any
   inclusion in adding public sector jobs...rather reducing them.

   Public-sector jobs have taken a beating in the past couple of years.
   Among teachers, most of them seem to be women, so that's one area where
   women would lose a higher percentage of jobs. Same for the healthcare
   field.

   It would be interesting to see a chart that shows job losses by sex in
   different job sectors.

   My question, I saw those 40 something professional women on the stage
   behind Romney for his ridiculous numbers on job losses for women - even
   Fox news didn't believe him. But here is my real question: where were
   the women who are , factory workers, cafeteria workers, checkout clerks
   at walmart, nurses, policewomen, fire fighters, students, retirees
   still working because their 401K funds fell flat at the end of the Bush
   presidency?

   It's great to have so many professional women pursuing their careers,
   but most women in the work force are struggling to raise a family and
   put in their 40 plus hours a week to buy the groceries, pay the rent,
   etc. Let's give them some attention too.

   Lots of job losses were women in the public sector due to GOP blocking
   of Obama sponsored aid to states. So, Romney is claiming Obama is to be
   blamed for female-heavy lay offs caused by the GOP. Par for the course.

   No kidding. The economy is a hugely complex machine, and it responds to
   many, many influences. Policies of the Obama administration are only
   one part of the story. What about the policies of two dozen Republican
   governors, working in lockstep to derail the recovery efforts and using
   extreme measures to ensure that President Obama is defeated in 2012? Or
   should we conveniently disregard that bloc (or should I say "block"?)
   when the goal is to heap all the blame on the President?

   So, following Romney to the logical conclusion of what he's flinging,
   women should vote for him - exactly why? So that they can experience
   100% job losses? Because candidate Romney has been 100% wrong on
   economic policy, and when he was governor, compared to his peers, he
   came in close to last on job creation.

   Ah so I see. A woman losing her job is more important than:

   -A woman being able to serve in combat (which is a job, btw)

   -A woman being able to have safe access to abortion (the doctors who
   provide these and their support staff are also jobs/employers, btw)

   -A woman being paid equally at whatever job she has (since you know
   having a job doesn't matter if you're not getting paid at said job)

   -A woman who doesn't make enough to support her family having access to
   WIC or food stamps (the consumerism from food stamps and WIC creates
   jobs, btw) (and since if she starves to death she won't exactly be able
   to work)

   -A woman having the ability to actually work (employers being allowed
   to deny women employment on the basis of disability, health and
   pregnancy, marital status, sexuality, gender identity, age, political
   affiliation, religious affiliation, etc.) (since, ya know, a woman has
   to actually be allowed to work in order for anything else to matter)

   -A woman having access to pap smears and mammogram screenings (since a
   dead or severely sick woman can't exactly work, now can she?) (the
   people who provide this healthcare also provide jobs, btw)

   -A woman having access to health insurance that treats her equally w/
   coverage (such as maternity care) and doesn't charge her more (since,
   ya know, if she can't go to the doctor and gets sick or dies that
   doesn't exactly help her w/ a job) (providing this insurance, btw,
   creates jobs)

   -A woman being investigated and potentially prosecuted for having a
   miscarriage (since, ya know, felons have such an easy time getting a
   job)

   -A woman being denied the right to marry (in the case of lesbians)
   (since, ya know, the marriage industry creates jobs AND married women
   are more likely to make more money, suffer from less health problems,
   and be more productive in the workforce)

   Gee, seems even if we take the jobs, jobs, jobs angle Mittens still
   fails

   needs to fly over to Fox News. I've been watching this political scene
   for a while and very rarely do I see the media attack the GOP as much

   It's the responsiblity of anyone who wants to be informed to fact
   check, because everyone in politics has their own agenda to pass. That
   responsibility is even more important when it's about a candidate who's
   beliefs you disagree with.

   That said, I have a great deal of trust in the president. Because he
   operates from the knowledge that many of his supporters will stop being
   his supporters if he lies to them.

   Mitt Romney does not operate from this place of thinking. He, and the
   GOP at large, seem to be under the impression that people are stupid.
   That the vast majority of American's don't care enough to check what
   Romney, or any of them say, and will simply take it at face value as
   the unassailable truth.

   Which is increasingly becoming NOT the case.

   Before Rush Limbaugh I didn't really pay attention to politics, but in
   the past couple of months, I have been listening and educating myself
   on many of the social issues that the Republican party is trying to
   push through, while operating under the banner of smaller government,
   and fiscal responsibility. And the GOP disturbs me.

   The degree to which they are lying to accomplish or hide their goals
   from the American people is at the least immoral. Provably, but only if
   you're willing to look at what they're doing, and what they want to do,
   and what they're accomplishing, and NOT what they're saying.

   Being a federal employee, I have a lot of experience with various
   pictoral representation of statistics...and how I can make numbers say
   just about anything. Point 1: on a graph like the one used, the top
   line generally depicts the predominant trend (greater value), and since
   the title of the Y axis is "Jobs Lost" and the red line on top is
   labeled "Men", kinda looks like men have lost more jobs that women.
   Point 2: if the Republican position is that government cannot create
   jobs, then how can they support the assertion that the government can
   destroy jobs? Point 3: Seeing as how President Obama's base is largely
   female and African American, it makes little sense that he would allow
   his base to take the brunt of this recession in the shorts. After all,
   African American unemployment is almost twice the national average.
   Point 4: If the Republicans really want to bolster their point, perhaps
   they should provide a break-down by industry. I believe construction is
   among the industries most affected by this recession, so...since it is
   an industry still dominated by men, would it not follow that men
   actually have lost more jobs, which is kinda what the graph shows?
   Point 5: Are the Republicans implying that President Obama actually
   laid off/fired all these women himself? I point you to the historical
   fact that, following WW II, unemployment for women surged as men came
   back from war and employers decided that men needed the jobs more
   because they had families to support. Is it possible that employers who
   have been sipping the "I want Obama to fail" kool-aid may in fact be
   intentionally and artificially supressing the job and financial markets
   in order to prevent the economy from recovering and hence causing Mr.
   Obama to "fail"? It would not be unfounded: take the case of the banks.
   The banks said they were not lending money because they had no money to
   lend, so the government gave them money to lend (remember the
   Stimulus?), and all they did was turn the money over several times, pay
   back the government, and pocket the earnings...to be given away in the
   form of executive bonuses. What a bunch of putzes.

   Why exactly is Romney putting the blame on the Obama Administration
   (regardless of the actual number of job losses for women)? In my own
   personal experience, there is still an unjust treatment toward women in
   the work place that has nothing to do with a government administration;
   rather the still prominent good ol' boy administration in corporate
   America is to blame. Women lose their jobs first.

   But what you don't understand is that even though Romney lies and
   bungles he is still white and therefore better, in the simple minds of
   many voters, than Obama or any person of color. This isn't about who
   tells the truth and who is the better man. For many in the regular
   population it is all about the color of the candidate's skin. Those of
   us who live in the middle of the country with just ordinary folks as
   neighbors know this for a fact, the rest of the country some how
   believes that there is no racial prejudice in the United States,
   certainly not enough to get Romney elected and I say "bullpucky" to
   that notion.
