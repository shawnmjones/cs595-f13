[22]Open thread for night owls: NSA surveillance could turn U.S. 'citizenry
into a nation of sheep'

   Stephen M. Walt writes--[29]The real threat behind the NSA surveillance
   programs:

   In fact, you should be worried, but not because most of you are likely
     to have your privacy violated and be publicly exposed. If you're an
     ordinary citizen who never does anything to attract any particular
      attention, you probably don't need to be concerned. Even if your
   Internet and phone records contain information you'd rather not be made
    public (an online flirtation, the time you emailed a friend to bring
    over some pot, or maybe some peculiar porn habits), there's safety in
               numbers, and you'll probably never be exposed.

   The real risk to our democracy is what this situation does to potential
   dissenters, whistle-blowers, investigative journalists, and anyone else
    who thinks that some aspect of government policy might be boneheaded,
   unethical, or maybe even illegal. If you are one of those people--even
   on just a single issue--and you decide to go public with your concerns,
   there's a possibility that someone who doesn't like what you are doing
   will decide to see what they can find out about you. It doesn't have to
       be the attorney general either; it might just be some anonymous
    midlevel bureaucrat or overly zealous defense contractor. Or maybe it
   will be someone who wants to suck up to their superiors by taking down
    a critic or who wants to have their own 15 minutes of fame. It really
    doesn't matter: Unless you've lived an absolutely pristine online and
     cellular life, you might wake up to discover that some regrettable
       moment from your past is suddenly being plastered all over the
               blogosphere or discussed in the New York Times.

    Does this danger sound far-fetched? Recall that when former diplomat
    Joseph Wilson published an op-ed debunking the Bush administration's
   claim that Saddam Hussein was trying to score uranium from Niger, some
   government officials decided to punish him by blowing his wife's cover
   as a CIA agent and destroying her career. Remember that David Petraeus
      lost his job as CIA director because a low-level FBI agent began
   investigating his biographer on an unrelated matter and stumbled across
     their emails. Recall further that long before the Internet age, J.
    Edgar Hoover helped keep himself in power at the FBI by amassing vast
   files of dirt on public figures. Given all that and more, is there any
     reason to believe that this vast trove of data won't eventually be
                       abused for political purposes?

    My point is that once someone raises their head above the parapet and
    calls attention to themselves by challenging government policy, they
   can't be sure that someone inside the government won't take umbrage and
                 try to see what sort of dirt they can find.
            _____________________________________________________

   [30]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2003--Is lying
   about WMDs an impeachable offense?:

    The question is rhetorical, of course. No one suggests that President
                       Bush will really be impeached.

      But it is a legit question, and it's especially surprising who is
             asking it: John Dean, Nixon's White House Counsel:

   Krugman is right to suggest a possible comparison to Watergate. In the
    three decades since Watergate, this is the first potential scandal I
     have seen that could make Watergate pale by comparison. If the Bush
   Administration intentionally manipulated or misrepresented intelligence
      to get Congress to authorize, and the public to support, military
   action to take control of Iraq, then that would be a monstrous misdeed.

    To put it bluntly, if Bush has taken Congress and the nation into war
    based on bogus information, he is cooked. Manipulation or deliberate
    misuse of national security intelligence data, if proven, could be "a
   high crime" under the Constitution's impeachment clause. It would also
     be a violation of federal criminal law, including the broad federal
     anti-conspiracy statute, which renders it a felony "to defraud the
   United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose."

   On today's [36]Kagro in the Morning show, total media dominance by a
   single, giant story has its advantages. One, it makes it easy to decide
   what to discuss that day on the show, and; two, it makes writing the
   episode synopsis relatively simple. Greg Dworkin and Armando both
   joined in a far-reaching and wide-ranging discussion of the exploding
   NSA story. And in the second half of the show, we read the
   seemingly-unrelated but still oddly-related story of the internal
   strife and collapse of Ohio's maverick-y ultra-conservative political
   consulting firm (described by some detractors as a "cult"), the
   Strategy Group for Media.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       when Hurricane Sandy hit.  It slowed down to under 1,000 new users
       in a 24-hour period, and we were back down to somewhat over 100 new
       users every 24 hours or so, until about January 30th, when it

     The always hermetic Bilderberg Group is currently holding its annual

     host America's foremost raving lunatic, Alex Jones, purveyor of
     foil-hat-making message board Infowars.com.

       was my first encounter with Mr. Jones.
       It was hypnotic.

     it. I have a treasure chest of knowledge and I can back it up with

     seems to be regurgitation of public education and a statist leaning.
     You claim "laws" brought you good things...I claimed that "laws"
     created the conditions you despise in the first place. Oh hey, look
     at the Patriot Act and NDAA...both "laws"...just like slavery, just
     because its a "law" aka writing on a piece of paper enforced through
     violence, doesn't make it legitimate. Nothing of what I claim or
     state is "pseudo knowledge"...my knowledge comes from countless
     hours of reading into what I claim...that seems to be more than your

   [582]When I Lived in London

   ... in the mid-1990s during my first grad school, the movie [583]In the
   Name of the Father was released.  As you know, the film is based on a
   true 1974 bombing incident in Guilford, which is 25-30 miles South of
   London.  It resulted in the conviction of four Irish Republican Army
   "suspected terrorists" - the so-called [584]Guilford Four, who each
   spent fifteen years in prison. Upon appeal, it was later found out that
   they had been falsely convicted, with confessions extracted through
   torture and other techniques.

   I tell you this story because the movie's release spurred a vigorous
   debate in British newspapers, most of them being national papers in a
   relatively small country.  I distinctly recall that one columnist (it
   may have been in the Observer) pointed out that the four men would not
   have been convicted had Britain had a written constitution and a Bill
   of Rights.

   I [585]studied international relations for almost a decade in four
   universities and can give you other examples where citizens of other
   countries point to the United States Constitution - an imperfect yet
   workable document - as an example of something to aspire to at least
   when it comes to protecting the rights of individuals.  In the current
   debate here on Daily Kos about NSA surveillance methods, some
   "My-Party-Right-or-Wrong" Democrats are forgetting that fact.

   Which is a damn shame, in my opinion.

   There a few other comments I made [586]in this diary by slatsg.

   They don't strike out in order to become activists, professionally
   speaking.

   They are often people who genuinely care about the quality of a job, or
   the way regulations should be upheld, or the safety issues that can
   endanger the citizens.

     "The real risk to our democracy is what this situation does to
     potential dissenters, whistle-blowers, investigative journalists,
     and anyone else who thinks that some aspect of government policy
     might be boneheaded, unethical, or maybe even illegal."

   THIS! This is so incredibly true. You don't have to be anyone
   important. You only have to stand up and be counted, and that makes you
   vulnerable. Welcome to the new state of Tall Poppy Central. Where any
   thing that sticks out over the artificially evened turf is lopped
   off--as a matter of course.

     It doesn't have to be the attorney general either; it might just be
     some anonymous midlevel bureaucrat or overly zealous defense
     contractor. Or maybe it will be someone who wants to suck up to
     their superiors by taking down a critic or who wants to have their
     own 15 minutes of fame.

   If you have ever had to blow the proverbial whistle, then you know this
   for a fact. This is what frightens me. This is what keeps me up at
   night. Because people like that don't just stop with you. They can ruin
   it for your spouse too, for your kids. A lot of people talk about being
   brave and standing up, but they don't know what it's like to do that
   and to find yourself unsupported, alone and targeted just as described
   above.

       He paid for telling the [771]earlier part of of the story that
       Snowden continues to unpack a bit

     one morning in July 2007, a dozen agents armed with rifles appeared
     at his house, with one of them entering the bathroom where Binney
     was toweling off after a shower, pointing a gun at him.
       This, even though Binney was simply charging that a wasteful and
       ineffective program was netting communication and wanted it
       replaced by a more effective one that he was convinced would've
       pre-empted 9/11.
       Even so, I don't want to imply that Binney is a fan of the current

   Walt is absolutely right-- while NSA surveillance is unlikely to target

   We're told that nothing happens unless it's "authorized" and such
   authorization happens under law.

   Well, there's a difference between "authority" and "capability." It's
   just human nature that if a person calculates an advantage, and their
   sense of right-and-wrong is based on their own interests, that they'll
   soon enough self-authorize.

   That's what the power-hungry, the corrupt, the insane do as a matter of
   course. It doesn't make any sense that a pool of a million or so
   people, many in private business, won't have a significant share of
   dubious characters.

   The power-obsessed, of course, know that "knowledge is power" and will
   certainly do all they can to position themselves advantageously.

   ...a libertarian issue? And why do so many Democrats fail to
   distinguish between civil libertarians and the big-L libertarians?

   Does this come from the same reasoning that calls people "fetishists"
   for not wanting unreasonable searches and seizures?

   Me, I love the First Amendment so much that I'd marry it if I could.
   The Fourth is a pretty cool concept, too, when followed. If that makes
   me a constitutional "fetishist," then call the damn vice squad.

   What's unnerving to me is the speed with which this has happened,
   because as recently as 2008, I recall Democrats standing up for those
   rights.

   approved by the person responsible for authorizing the data

   signed using public key encryption (perhaps with a rolling code scheme

       authorization problem but if such a system has to exist (and it
       probably doesn't) then there is no reason not to make it as secure
       as possible.  The only ways to defeat such a system would be to
       either hack the authorizer's computer or hack the data
       collection/retrieval system itself both of which would be heavily
       secured (and with heavy penalties for doing so).
       The point still stands, many people focus too much on authority
       rather than capability.  In fact, the reason the pdroid mod is so
       popular is because it lets you revoke the capability of an android
       app to do something you don't want (like access your GPS location)
       rather than merely the take it or leave it approach (i.e. authority
       based) of official android.

   says that if evolution is correct, how come no other animals have
   evolved to speak either? I told him about a cat I had who could say the

     NSA leak prompts questions over U.S. reliance on contractors

     (Reuters) - The U.S. government may have to reconsider how much it
     relies on outside defense contractors who are given top security
     clearances after an NSA contractor exposed top-secret phone and
     internet surveillance programs.

     Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old systems technician at Booz Allen
     Hamilton Holding Corp, admitted on Sunday that he divulged details
     of the National Security Agency's programs to The Guardian and
     Washington Post.

     Booz shares fell 2.6 percent on Monday, and peers such as SAIC and
     General Dynamics fell as much as 1.7 percent.

     "We do need to take another, closer look at how we control
     information and how good we are at identifying what people are doing
     with that information," said Stewart Baker, former general counsel
     at the NSA and former assistant secretary for policy at the
     Department of Homeland Security.

       doubt Snowden's credibility.  This is only based on a few

       LOD quoted him as saying he "knows everything" and I read somewhere
       that he is a Ron Paul supporter.
       I'm just not convinced that this is the bombshell it started out to
       be.  Snowden is employed by a private contractor which is mining

     between "foreign powers" and "agents of foreign powers" (which may
     include American citizens and permanent residents suspected of

   Hell, the very way we define "getting along with people" contains a
   heavy dose of "BE similar to other people." Our ability to get along
   and work with dissimilar people has been trained out of us, by a
   workplace that places "being a good fit" at the top of its list of
   desired qualities.

   The NSA and TSA have done their part in triggering our self-censorship

     US Soldier's 'Phone Sex' Intercepted, Shared

     Faulk says he and others in his section of the NSA facility at Fort
     Gordon routinely shared salacious or tantalizing phone calls that
     had been intercepted, alerting office mates to certain time codes of
     "cuts" that were available on each operator's computer.

     "Hey, check this out," Faulk says he would be told, "there's good
     phone sex or there's some pillow talk, pull up this call, it's
     really funny, go check it out. It would be some colonel making
     pillow talk and we would say, 'Wow, this was crazy'," Faulk told ABC
     News.

   Good phone sex? That's when the NSA guys gathered 'round? That's what

     and calls attention to themselves by challenging government policy,
     they can't be sure that someone inside the government won't take
     umbrage and try to see what sort of dirt they can find.

   has the right to investigate call records wherein somebody is
   interacting with anyone on the terrorist watch list. If your phone
   records indicate that you're communicating with terrorists, you'll be
   under investigation otherwise your records won't be looked into. I

 Drawing a line in the sand... ([1665]0+ / 0-)

   The days of being anonymous are ending quickly if not ended already.
   But as Walt clearly states, we need not worry about the correct use of
   this information, but the abuse of it. And in a program this large with
   so many fingers in it there is bound to be someone capable of this.

   The IRS might be a good example case in this situation. How does the
   IRS secure our private information? How do they manage the data without
   disclosing our private data to every low level employee within its
   ranks? Can something similar be applied to the immense data being
   gathered by the NSA?

   Social Security Numbers seem to be their main method of making the
   public seem anonymous to the outside world. But this hasn't stopped
   people from finding out things about us. So what else can we do to
   ensure that they use this raw data ethically and dispose of it when its
   no longer necessary? We really need to have legislation written up to
   effectively draw a line where this Raw Data collection must stop and
   where our private information begins.

   corporation in charge of surveillance. Bingo, they know everything

   Further, with privatization, people have little recourse. If the

 Let's Keep Perspective ([1677]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1678]KayCeSF

   In recent years I have noticed a strong turn on DKOS towards fear of
   the US Government.  This has always struck me as strange since, of the
   two major political parties, it is the left wing who believes in the
   positive value of government action and the right wing that castigates
   government as inherently evil and corrupt.

   Much of the pernicious activity noted in this diary need not be
   conducted by government.  Anyone with decent skills and access to the
   right programs can invade your online privacy.  You are constantly
   monitored by the private sector, which tracks what sites you visit,
   what you buy, etc.  The moment you pick up that phone you can
   potentially have your privacy violated - the FBI has had wiretap
   authority since the 1930's.

   There are legitimate issues with the current NSA affair.  I don't want
   to call it a scandal because it is as yet unclear if anyone in
   government has broken any laws.  The issue seems to be whether the
   existing laws and the way they are enforced are overly broad and
   subject to abuse.

   That sort of issue can and should be dealt with through the democratic
   process.  If we truly believe that no government agency should access
   call data (non-content, just the fact a call was made) without a court
   order, we can do that.  But we had not yet made that a requirement.
   How can we lash the US Government for doing something we as citizens
   have permitted them to do, either through omission or commission?

   But its all secret, you say.  How can I permit something I don't know
   about?  Easy - we have delegated that authority.  Secrecy laws have
   been part of the US Government since the beginning.  We have adjusted
   them over time.  For example, after the Hoover abuses.  If we decide we
   want the US Government to be a fishbowl visible in every action to all,
   friend or foe, we can write the laws for that (as unwise as I think
   that would be).

   The point I make is that there are legal actions through the democratic
   process that: a) created what we have in terms of our national security
   apparatus and laws; b) are subject to being changed if we so deem it.

   I find it very frustrating to read diary after diary on DKOS that
   presents the US public as helpless victims and subjects of dark forces
   we cannot resist.

   This is OUR country.  If there is a mess, WE had a hand in either
   creating it or allowing it to happen.  And if there is something amiss,
   we can do what we always do (or attempt to do) - fix it.

   We do not live in a tyranny.  We do not live in a dictatorship.  Let's
   take ownership of our problems and stop conjuring worst case scenarios
   when all the facts are not in.

       Since 9/11 the national security apparatus has grown tremendously.
        Add to that the fact that the Bush Administration presided over
       most of that period, with their anti-government mindset.
       The result was a massive use of private contractors to do what
       might otherwise require expansion of the federal civil service.  To
       the right wing, this has several advantages:
       - they can steer contracts to their allies
       - contractors are more easily controlled, since unlike a civil
       servant you can cut them off whenever you want
       - over time, you can shrink the federal agencies simply by
       replacing them
