   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [42]Tagging tips - [43]Search For Tags - [44]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   stations- coordinated and unchallenged lying to 50 mil a week.

   we should have been protesting at those stations.

   the cheerleaders and lack of questioning was rampant in the MSM but it
   was on the radio where the lies could be repeated all day long without
   question until they were acceptable and  could be repeated without
   shame in the MSM and floor of congress.

   critics and protestors of the war were seldom called traitors in the
   MSM but they were called traitors all day on the radio.

   while dem senators tried for more debate on giving bush war powers it
   was the GOP forcing the vote- with all national and local radio
   blowhards screaming together the day before for americans to call their
   senators and tell them to "stand up and be counted!"

   it was on the radio where the think tanks and maybe the pentagon put
   their paid callers.

   like so many other major events in our history the last 25 years, the
   story would have been very different if the right wasn't getting a free
   speech free ride from the loudest and most effective propaganda tool in
   our history.

       I agree. But your rightwing radio theory doesn't explain this:

     Number of Americans who believe Saddam-9/11 tie rises to 41 percent
     Josh Catone
     Published: Sunday June 24, 2007

     A new Newsweek poll out this weekend exposed "gaps" in America's
     knowledge of history and current events.
     Perhaps most alarmingly, 41% of Americans answered 'Yes' to the
     question "Do you think Saddam Hussein½s regime in Iraq was directly
     involved in planning, financing, or carrying out the terrorist
     attacks of September 11th, 2001?"
     That total is actually up 5 points since September 2004.
       [278]http://rawstory.com/...
       Frankly, that can only be blamed on the abject failure of the MSM
       as far as I can tell.

 yes they failed. they were also intimidated by the ([282]0+ / 0-)
       same teabagger talk radio base that screams into the phones on que
       when ordered by their gods for, for instance, health care reform,
       or debt ceilings.
       the other factor that isn't considered is that over the talk radio
       years 15-25% (25% during bush i think) say they get their news from
       talk radio.
       there are many people who are apathetic until time to vote (or all
       the time) and are open to persuasion - co workers, relatives,
       friends, etc.
       the talk radio effect is huge and was critical to getting us into
       that idiocy. they couldn't have done it without radio getting a
       pass from the left.
       if the left had protested those radio stations that were selling
       the lies the media would have been less likely to repeat them and
       go along. repeating what limbaugh and hannity are saying should
       have penalty.

   They were ashamed that president Bush came from Texas.

   Now, it is perfectly acceptable to call President Obama any insult
   (whether it makes sense or not), threaten his life in jokes, make
   racists depictions, refer to him as the anti-christ, refuse to follow
   orders because you believe he is illigitimate, scream "You Lie" in
   congress at him, etc...

   I thought it was supporting terrorism to disagree with your president
   while we are at war?

       when it comes to politics.
       most americans under 50 are pretty apathetic politically and don't
       pay much attention. they get news from MSM which leaves out the
       important stuff and goes establishment/1% on most everything else.
       major events that do get their attention often will come second
       hand or with the MSM's version. then the influence of more engaged
       co-workers, friends, and family kicks in.
       in most parts of the country, with many low pop states with 2
       senators, those engaged people often have only one free source for
       politics while driving or working.
       the 1% uses the 20% to get 50%'s worth just because they have 1000
       giant invisible soapboxes, and the country's political circus goes
       crazy over a few percentage points.
       it's been working great for the roves the last 25 years and it can
       slowly fade away in influence on its own or the left can stop
       ignoring it, do something about it, stop getting their asses
       kicked, and finally get some real reforms going.

   ...They were waving the bloody shirt of 9-11. Remember that? Iraq had
   NOTHING to do with it!!

   I remember the casualties. There were several men who died in a
   helicopter crash the first day of operations. I believe another was
   killed by "friendly fire."

   But I swore I would never forget the name of 2nd Lieutenant Therrel
   Shane Childers, US Army. I believe he was the first man killed by
   hostile fire. His father went on tv and publicly blamed Bush for
   killing his boy. I do too.

   Since then 4488 men died as a result of Bush, Cheney and their lies.
   Estimates range from 32,000 to 100,00 American wounded. (depends who
   you ask) I've not bothered to learn who the last person to die as a
   result of the Iraq war as they will continue well into the future; from
   physical wounds and mental ones which have claimed countless suicides
   and will into the future.

   I said something against the Iraq war and was assumed to be a militant
   pacifist.  Nobody seemed to grasp that it was possible for someone to
   oppose this particular war for any reason other than being opposed to
   war in general.

   That was the approximate level of discourse I kept encountering.
   Blaming the media kind of feels too easy, but by god they didn't help
   any.
