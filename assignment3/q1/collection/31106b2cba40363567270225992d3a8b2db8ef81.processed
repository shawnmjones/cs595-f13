Obama is right where he wants to be

   A month ago, there was a fair amount of bravado in Republican circles,
   with many in the GOP cautiously optimistic the presidential race. The
   swagger is now gone -- Politico [3]quoted "top advisers to Mitt Romney"
   who conceded that President Obama is the favorite. The same piece said
   internal Republican polls show Ohio "clearly" leaning in the
   president's favor.

   Now that the dust has settled on both major-party conventions, we can
   also take a look at two full weeks' worth of Gallup tracking data.

   That straight, boring line on the left half of the chart? That's the
   period around the Republican convention -- which showed no bounce for
   Romney at all. As things currently stand, Gallup shows Obama up by
   five, which is hardly an insurmountable lead, but is the larger
   advantage either candidate has enjoyed in the last 11 weeks. Other
   polls are pointing [4]in a similar direction.

   With a growing sense of dread in Republican circles, the Romney
   campaign's pollster [5]published a memo this morning, urging everyone
   to just calm down. Neil Newhouse -- yes, [6]that Neil Newhouse --
   acknowledged Obama's lead, but dismissed the president's advantage as
   "a sugar high" that won't last.

   He may well be right. We don't yet know whether Obama's current lead is
   the result of a post-convention bounce that will soon fade, or whether
   it's a new normal that will last until the debates in a few weeks. Time
   will tell.

   That said, it's worth noting that the Team Romney memo was extremely
   thin -- it wasn't based on data or any kind of evidence; it was instead
   based on hopes of what Republicans think could happen in the near
   future. For GOP voters worried about Romney's chances, the polling memo
   effectively boiled down to, "This'll work out; trust us."

   For Republicans inching closer to panic, this may fall short of
   reassuring. Romney was supposed to get a bump when Paul Ryan was
   introduced, but that didn't amount to much. He was supposed to get a
   bump from his convention, but that proved underwhelming, too.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Mark Halperin, who's generally a fairly reliable barometer of what the
   inside-the-beltway establishment is thinking, [7]said this morning that
   Romney "faces the immediate threat of both quiet and loud
   we-told-you-so's from Republicans who last year had the very worries
   they fear are being manifested now. Romney is an awkward, unlikable
   candidate.... Until Romney breaks this cycle, he is in danger of living
   out the Haley Barbour dictum: in politics, bad gets worse."

   Halperin added that GOP donors may even start investing less in the
   presidential race and more in congressional contests if they perceive
   Romney as a likely loser.

   For what it's worth, I tend to think all this handwringing in
   Republican circles is premature. But eight weeks out, it's also fair to
   say Obama, not his challenger, is exactly where he wants to be.

   Sick n effin tired is correct as regards the "Florida Horseshoe" (That
   is Naples to Orlando to Miami).

   Sick n effin tired is also correct as regards the Canadian health
   system. I spend half the year in Canada and have found few who want any
   part of the U.S. model -- and most who do have had a bad experience.
   "Bad Experiences" should not happen, but they do and I'd be pissed if I
   had one too. Its like, with me, I shall never even consider buying
   anything labelled "Magnavox".

   But I am an optimist even though I know in FL, Ohio, and the other
   "decider" states the TV and the Radio and the Mailman for goddess's
   sake will be all up in your bed with you for the next several weeks.

   Why am I optimistic?

   Easy: Obama has lower negatives and has successfully stated the
   pertinent proposition: "Hey! You know who I am, but who the hell is
   this other guy?"

   ...and the other guy will not answer

   Now beloved President Eisenhower is a hero to golfers for popularizing
   the game and playing close to 1,000 rounds while in office.

   George P. Shultz tells of meeting Ike after Nixon nominated him as
   Secretary of Labor. Here's what Ike told him:

   "Young man, let me tell you something. You are going to work 14 hours a
   day, seven days a week for the government, and you are going to think
   you are doing your job. Here is what I want you to know. If that's what

   For these last couple of weeks, I was amped up enough to actually
   respond to certain facebook "friends" (actually family or I'd de-friend

   In the interest of preserving the family peace, I have decided to stop

   What did they day about FDR when he and his Congress started the WPA
   and Social Security? The real issue is that Democrats want to use our
   tax monies to better social, economic and health issues for Americans
   while the GOP says you're on your own. I wonder if GOP voters have
   thought about what would happen to them if Romney/Ryan is elected. They
   probably will kick in with the Ryan tax plan to give the rich more tax
   breaks and kill Medicare and Medicaide. What they aren't thinking about
   is the call they will receive from the rest home that their parents are
   in with the rest home saying the parents have to get out since they
   don't have Medicaide to pay for their care anymore.

   The problem with your statement, Eric, is the entire statement in of

   You do not and can not inherent a war, economic depression and stock
   collapse without tapering. Your facts are wrong, faulty, disproved and
   above all, somewhat hilarious.

   Equally hilarious is your last argument. Because somehow, on a
   government level, taking away the rights and liberties of others
   (issues such AS gay marriage and the ability to have an abortion/attain
   free contraceptives/ federally or government funded institutes,
   programs and clinics that world towards the health of all) is not
   government involvement at all.

   If Romney loses, then Jeb Bush wins because he can run in 2016. I would
   not be surprised if Daddy Bush and friends are secretly working against
   Romney to clear the way for Jeb Bush. However, there is a large
   stumbling block to that nomination. If Romney loses, then the radicals
   are going to blame Romney for being too moderate. The Republicans
   doubled down on Bush economics with this election. So the Republicans
   are likely to double down on the crazy and double double down on Bush
   economics for 2016. The Republican party is becoming a battleground for
   the regular Republicans and the Koch Bros./Tea Party radicals and the
   latter seems to be controlling the party. That makes it difficult for
   Jeb Bush to unite both factions by 2016 and run as a moderate.

   As a fiscal conservative I'd like to point out a big difference between
   us and Tea-baggers, we want government paid for first. If that means
   cuts, cut. If that means raise taxes, raise taxes. It may not be the
   most popular standpoint, but it is the most economical sensible
   standpoint. If Mitt-staken on everything is elected or in 2016 we get
   Bush v3.0, I fear I will be forced to move to Canada as I don't want to
   deal with that huge tax-cut/deregulation fiscal implosion that will
   happen. It'll make Europe look like vacation and the great Depression
   will be a walk in the park. I don't agree with everything Obama's done,
   but the worst of his policies in my mind are better than the best
   policy that Mitt-staken refuses to explain. Even my 11 year old asked
   how he can cut taxes, increase military and entitlement spending and
   still balance the budget. I told him "Son, in the land of make-believe,
   anything can happen. Here in the real world, the electorate just foots
   the bill and holds the bag and hopes for better days ahead." Then I
   told him to start practicing O, Canada!

   When the Tea Party doesn't manage to "take their country back" this
   time, perhaps moderate republicans will manage to "take their party

   I kinda doubt it, but you never know.

   Personally, I would think it would be best for both parties, and the
   country, if there is no pseudo-incumbent/establishment candidate
   running. No Bush, no Clinton, no Biden, no Ryan.

   For the moderate Republicans, the best and only way out of this dilemma
   is for the Tea Party to get tossed out in this election so that
   moderates would be less likely to face primary challenges in the next
   elections. That would make it easier for the moderates to squeeze
   Grover Norquist on his pledge and let the Republicans make changes in
   the tax code without calling it a tax increase. If Norquist sees no
   base of support to left to challenge moderate Republicans, he is going
   to be forced to accommodate the moderates or face an outright
   abandonment of the pledge. Norquist is not going to like losing
   influence on tax policy, but his choices are limited. Human nature will
   dictate the accommodation of moderates unless Norquist is as crazy as
   the Tea Party.

   The thing is if you actually had a debate between a conservative and a
   liberal in which both were trying to tackle the issue of the budget and
   both weren't being hyperbolic, party-line toters, and if both weren't
   morons you actually might be able to come to compromise. Let's raise
   some revenues here, cut some spending there, and make sure we're doing
   it in a way that isn't going to have drastic effects.

   But that's not the dichotomy we get. The dichotomy is either a. you
   choose spending cuts that are going to WILDLY cause damage to the
   middle-class and poor or b. you choose spending cuts that are modest
   and will mostly hurt the poor.

   There isn't a discussion about give and take, there isn't a discussion
   about our responsibility as a government to take care of our citizens
   (hell the Republican Party at this point in time doesn't seem to
   believe that such a responsibility exists), there isn't even a
   discussion about waste, fraud, and abuse. I bet there are all kinds of
   changes we could make from reforming the tax code to having each
   individual bureaucracy audited for expenditures that we might be able
   to cut to take spending down. But that requires from our government a
   willingness to micromanage between the states and the federal level
   while simultaneously to hold a stringent line. And right now I don't
   think you have people in office who want to be that flexible. It's
   either this black and white solution or that black and white solution
   because that makes our donors happy. And if it makes our donors happy
   then screw everyone else. Or so it seems to me.

   Wait a minute Eric! you just complained above about Democrats and now
   you're complaining that we don't get along. Do you not see the inherent
   problem here? How can we get along if you're always trying to find
   people to blame?

   For the record we are not 16trillion in debt. For the last damn time
   people the 16 trillion you're seeing is projected debt over 10 years.
   Read the damn chart next time from the CBO instead of just looking at
   the end number. Debt does not start over at 0 for each administration.
   You act as though Obama himself added 6$ trillion in debt. Obama has
   not spent 6$ trillion during his presidency. Now he has spent about
   3$trillion. If you want to attack him for that then at the least you'd
   be correct. The remaining 3$trillion had to do with carryover from the
   Bush Administration and from the recession. Because, again, when we
   talk about the US debt we are talking about projected debt: debt
   projections made under the Bush Administration (valued around
   10-12trillion$ over 10 years and around 16$trillion over 20 years)
   carry over to the Obama Administration just as they will carry over to
   the next administration. It doesn't start over at 0 with each
   president. Even if a president came in and did nothing the debt would
   still continue to rise because it rolls over. You can't blame any one
   particular administration for the existence of debt. You can blame
   administrations for the spending that takes place under their term that
   increases the projected debt, but not things that were given to them.
   You talk about wanting to work together, but we cannot do this unless
   you're willing to put YOUR partisanship aside and have a serious
   discussion.

   to advertising (when you throw in the super PAC money that doesn't
   coordinate with the campaign **wink wink**), but the more he attempts
   positive advertising the more likely he is to see his favorability fall
   (to know Mitt Romney is to ... Meh), so that leaves massive spending on
   negative campaigning. He can't raise his boat, so he will have to sink
   Obama. His problem is that Obama IS A LIKEABLE GUY. Negative ads are
   unlikely to persuade the undecided and more likely to turn them off to
   Mitt. Despite all his verbal gymnastics in not taking a firm stand on
   any policy whatsoever, his personality has him trapped between a rock
   and hard place.

   The question of coordinating ads with PACs is kinda like asking whether
   the gas stations are engaged in price-fixing. They don't have to meet
   and agree, they just have to look across the street and see the signs.
   Likewise, Romney can put an ad up in one market (or on the internet)
   and the PAC can put a similar one up somewhere else.

   Last week, Dr. Maddow made a pretty big deal over Mitt Romney's
   upcoming, high-profile interview. She strongly suggested that, by
   applying a modicum of real journalism on behalf of the public, Mr.
   Romney might be compelled to clarify his Party's hilarious and/or
   alarming and/or dishonest positions on a variety of issues, including
   it truly medieval views on rape, abortion, etc. Since David Gregory has
   (once again) let an opportunity for genuine public dialogue on
   genuinely vital issues slip away by (once again) spectacularly failing
   to use his privileged position to commit real journalism, I wonder what
   Dr. Maddow will have to say tonight about her colleague's persistent
   habit of abdicating of his professional responsibilities when they are
   needed the most?

   Gregory actually tried (for once), at least in the weirdly staged,
   no-girls-allowed rooftop clubhouse scene. The real problem is, he's
   just not all that bright. I think most of his brainpower is focused on
   trying to make "objective" and "serious" faces for the camera.

   When the great Tim Russert passed away, I was so overwhelmingly sad. I
   was never a big fan of David Gregory (though I feel he is generally a
   nice man). I think you hit the nail on the head with his being more
   focused on looking "objective" and "serious" for the camera -- he
   always falls short though in these big interviews. He smiles and nods
   along when he is clearly being fed a crock of lies instead of pushing
   hard to reveal the tough answers the public is hoping to hear. I think
   politicians must know that they can go on Meet The Press now and do
   their usual talking-points-mumbo-jumbo and get away with it because
   David Gregory comes off as a bit of a pushover. I don't think anyone
   can compare to Tim Russert but I was (and still am) in awe that Mr.
   Gregory is hosting the show. Personally, I wish that someone like
   Andrea Mitchell would have taken over in her dear friend's former role.

   There was a time when broadcast news was used as a method of fulfilling
   the requirement that radio and TV stations, and by extension their
   networks, serve the public interest. Also, the huge egos who formed
   these networks, guys like Sarnoff and Paley, valued their news
   divisions for the prestige they brought to the network, and to the huge
   egos of the founders.

   Now they're expected to make money. Period.

   But I should probably add that now there's a symbiotic relationship
   between these shows and their guests. No guests, no show. So you can't
   be too "mean" if you want them to keep showing up.

   Romney must win the swing states of Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio, and
   Virginia in order to win. The odds of that happening are around 20%.
   That puts Obama's reelection odds at 80%. I believe Obama will win the
   popular vote by around 1 million votes and get 332 of the electoral
   votes to Romney's 206.. Obama will win all four swing states that
   Romney needs and he will be reelected by a comfortable margin.

   Honestly, I think that there's going to be an October surprise or two,
   both of them favoring Obama. First, I think that there's going to be
   some Romney tax revelation that's going to destroy him. Proof that he
   paid no income tax, or proof that he engaged in illegal dealings with
   his assets.

   Second, I believe that Israel will strike at Iran's nuclear facilities,
   probably with the aid of the US military.

   If both of those scenarios happen, I don't see Romney getting more than
   40% of the popular vote. If only one happens, he might get 45%. If
   things just continue the way they are, he'll be lucky to crack 46%.

   I also think these polls overestimate Romney's likely voters, because
   I'd be willing to wager that many people are saying they'll vote Romney
   as a protest. But, when it comes down to the wire, I don't believe that
   they'll vote for him. Especially older voters. As more and more seniors
   and older folks learn about Ryancare, with it's Groupons for insurance,
   they're going to be utterly turned off.

   Netanyahu made a clever move earlier this year to form a coalition
   government. Many believe he hoped this show of unity would strengthen
   his hand against Iran, both diplomatically and domestically.
   Unfortunately for him, this coalition recently fell apart over domestic
   issues.

   I am not an Israeli politician who's trying to hold onto his job, so I
   can't criticize Netanyahu too much. Also, I have little doubt he
   sincerely believes he's acting in his country's best interests. But a
   quote from a retired security official accused Netanyahu of making
   decisions "based on messianic feelings."

   So, before some dingbat here starts accusing TC and calling him names
   for "Jewish Nazis of the Israeli Right," remember that here at home we
   don't have to love our current government to love our country, and
   besides, many Israelis feel as TC does.

   Coming soon: The Band Wagon Effect.

   As it becomes clear that Obama will win, down-ballot Dems will feel
   safer in identifying with him and the Dem agenda. Running against the
   do-nothing GOP House may allow the Dems to re-capture the House and
   keep the Senate.

   Big donors will stop giving to Mitt; saving their cash or spending it
   on electable republicans. Down-ballot races become the focus, boosting
   enthusiasm and participation nationwide. But even if the GOP keeps the
   House, a second Obama term means that the Tea-party agenda is a

     For GOP voters worried about Romney's chances, the polling memo
     effectively boiled down to, "This'll work out; trust us."

   Trust Us - the new GOP motto and answer for everything they don't want
   to give a truthful answer to.

   This Thursday, PA Supreme Court starts hearing the Voter ID appeal. The
   Court is short on Judge and is evenly divided 3 Dems and 3 GOPs. The
   President of Court is J. Ron Castile. He and Gov. Ed Rendell were buds
   as ADAs together back in the good ole days long, long ago in
   Philadelphia. According to Ed, while Ron is a Republican, he will "do
   he right thing." The Guv has faith in his buddy. I'm trying to, but am
   holding my breath.

   You wouldn't believe the hoops one has to jump through just because one
   does not drive or have a passport. Even other Gov. issued ID - if it
   does not have an unexpired expiration date won't get you in the voting
   booth. If you are 18 and live at home, but because your parents pay the
   bills and you don't have an electric bill and/or lease to prove you
   live at that address, your parent is supposed to come with you to the
   DMV and swear out an affidavit!! Hello!

   If you are homeless, you have to have someone from a shelter who can
   prove they work for the shelter with the proper I.D. has to come to the
   DMV and swear out an affidavit. On and on and on it goes.

   Normally, I would say that a good mix of Dems and GOP in the government
   is a good thing and keeps things in check, but until we find a way to
   identify if the Grand Old Party still exists, I say let's remember the
   down ticket and VOTE THEM OUT so POTUS has some sane folks to work
   with. Also, since the GOP are big on "the people have spoken" and
   mandates, let's give them one there is no denying.

   I would also like to hedge our bets that, God Forbid!, should POTUS not
   win re-election, RoMoney faces a Demoratic House and Senate. That's the
   only kind of "taking back" I want.

   We all recognize that America's (USA) education infrastructure is vital
   to our economic success and is critical to our national security.
   Romney/Ryan has produced a policy paper on their educational plans.
   What is not said is that the plan is not going to be funded. The
   Romany/Ryan plan focuses on for profit colleges and reduction in
   graduate school support. To meets his goals, at least a 40% reduction
   in college aid will be implemented. What does this mean for our number
   one competitive advantage? That is, our colleges and universities?
   Simply put, it will mean that many if not most colleges will be hit
   hard. They will be required to layoff teachers and cut back on critical
   programs -- engineering, science and graduate studies. This will have a
   long term impact on the economy, and will increase the number of
   foreign visas to staff the industries of the future. Jobs will not go
   to our citizens.

   If you are a Republican, Democrat, Independent, etc., you need to alert
   your colleges and universities to engage them in fighting the gutting
   of America's long term economic educational infrastructure.

   "Romney is an awkward, unlikable candidate" YES, this was the problem a

   from him and like him even less. Hence, the now more exciting graph.

   I agree. I am unsure why Republican donors are pouring cash into
   Romney's campaign. He is running a TON of ads in Ohio and the state is
   moving towards Obama. It's not working. At some point soon (probably
   after he looses the first debate when he stumbles several times as
   predicted) they are going to have to shut off the money. Things can
   change, but trends now predict an 80% chance that Obama is re-elected..

   A five-point advantage is not nearly enough, especially in Ohio where
   the Secretary of State plays fast and loose with vote counting. As long

   Republicans, Obama will need at least a ten-point lead to overcome

   Hey, your opening sentence has an error - I think the writer meant to

   Just wanted to point that out if it hasn't been pointed out already :)

   VERY exciting news! I was looking forward to seeing the bounce that
   Obama would get from the DNC and I am very happy to see him looking
   better going into the debates.

   My biggest worry is that Romney has such an enormous advantage
   money-wise that he can drown the few swing states in misleading ads. I
   am HOPING that they will run their ads, maybe get desperate and make
   some really awful ones too... and then by the time the debates come the
   public will get to SEE these guys debate. And I definitely think Obama
   will clobber Romney in the debates. Mitt gets so uncomfortable ---
   especially about foreign policy -- so I say, bring on the debates. If
   anyone is swayed by Romney's massive negative ads they will hopefully
   come to their senses during the debates as they see a President who can
   lead and a super-rich business fool try to awkwardly laugh his way
   through major American issues.
