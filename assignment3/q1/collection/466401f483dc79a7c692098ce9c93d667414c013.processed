Missing woman's body found 28 years later, behind false wall

   By Lawrence Crook, CNN
   updated 10:45 AM EDT, Wed July 3, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * A contractor finds a skeleton inside a container behind a false
       wall
     * Joann Nichols' husband reported her missing in 1985
     * Her husband continued to live in the house until he died there in
       December

   (CNN) -- The hidden skeleton of a woman who had been missing for 28
   years came to light when a contractor cleaned out a vacant home in the
   Town of Poughkeepsie, New York.

   The gruesome find was uncovered behind a 'false wall' in the basement
   of the home the woman had shared with her late husband, police said.

   Joann Nichols' remains were found inside a large plastic bin, inside a
   plastic bag and wrapped in a sheet, said Dr. Kari Reiber, the Dutchess
   County Medical Examiner.

   "The body was skeletonized and the hands were tied with rope. ... A
   large area of the right side of the skull was also missing," Reiber
   said.
   Joann Nichols was reported missing in 1985 and her body was found
   behind a false wall in her late husband\'s house.
   Joann Nichols was reported missing in 1985 and her body was found
   behind a false wall in her late husband's house.

   Sealing the body in the plastic bin behind a false wall might have been
   enough to mask the smell as the body decomposed, she said.

   Members of the medical examiner's office removed the body after it was
   found Friday and were able to identify Nichols through dental records.
   An autopsy showed the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the
   head, according to Reiber.

   Nichols, a 55-year-old former first-grade teacher at Gayhead Elementary
   School in Hopewell Junction New York, was reported missing on December
   21, 1985, by her husband, James Nichols.

   Police said he called in the report after his wife didn't show up for a
   hair appointment at a beauty parlor earlier that day. The next day the
   couple's vehicle was discovered in the parking lot of a shopping center
   in the town.

   Police Chief Thomas Mauro said an intensive investigation followed, but
   the woman was never located. The case had remained open since 1985 and
   was reviewed annually by police, he said.

   James Nichols was found dead in the home on December 27 after concerned
   neighbors called police because they had not seen him in several days.
   He was 82 and died of natural causes, police said.

   Officers said they found the house filled with personal items, debris
   and garbage.

   No one in Nichols' family came forward to claim his body or take
   control of his estate, so Dutchess County Commissioner of Finance
   Pamela Barrack was appointed as temporary administrator, according to
   Barrack's attorney, Kelly Traver.

   "We were only able to locate two family members of Mr. Nichols, but
   they were not able to claim his body," Traver said.

   Nichols was buried by the Dutchess County Department of Community and
   Family Services in an unknown location, Traver said.

   The Town of Poughkeepsie Police Department said it has not closed the
   case and will continue to examine the new forensic evidence.

   "It's now safe to say James Nichols is a suspect in this case," said
   police Capt. Paul LeComte.

   The Town of Poughkeepsie surrounds the City of Poughkeepsie in
   southeastern New York State, about 70 miles north of New York City.
