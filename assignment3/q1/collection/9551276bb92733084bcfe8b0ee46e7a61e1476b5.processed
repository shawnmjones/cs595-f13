   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Tuesday is the fourth anniversary of Michael Jackson's death
     * Prince Jackson is expected to be the next witness in the AEG Live
       trial
     * Expert concludes AEG Live created a medical conflict of interest
       with Jackson's doctor
     * AEG Live lawyers argue Jackson, not its execs, hired and supervised
       Dr. Conrad Murray

   Los Angeles (CNN) -- Four years after Michael Jackson died, his oldest
   son is ready to tell a jury about the last days of his life.

   Prince Jackson, now 16, was 12 when he followed an ambulance carrying
   his father to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on the afternoon of
   June 25, 2009.

   On Monday, in the Jackson family's wrongful death lawsuit, Jackson
   lawyers informed AEG Live attorneys that Prince will be the next
   witness after a doctor who is an expert in medical conflicts of
   interest completes his testimony Tuesday.

   That would likely put Prince on the stand Wednesday, a day after the
   fourth anniversary of his father's death.

   Michael Jackson\'s children in the spotlight Michael Jackson's children
   in the spotlight

   Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson and their grandmother Katherine
   Jackson are suing AEG Live, accusing their father's last concert
   promoter of negligently hiring, retaining or supervising Dr. Conrad
   Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's
   death.
   Doctor: Jackson had no REM sleep
   Paris: Michael said nanny 'lied a lot'
   Compare Michael Jackson in 2001 to 2009
   What did AEG know about MJ's health?

   Jackson lawyers argue that the promoter and producer of the "This Is
   It" shows pressured Murray to get Jackson to rehearsals but failed to
   get Jackson help despite numerous red flags that he was in trouble.

   Murray told police he used the surgical anesthetic propofol nearly
   every night for two months to treat Jackson's insomnia. The coroner
   ruled that an overdose of propofol killed him.

   AEG Live lawyers argue that Jackson chose and supervised Murray and
   that their executives had no way of knowing the doctor was using the
   dangerous treatment.

   [42]Remembering Michael Jackson's music

   A medical conflict of interest

   Dr. Gordon Matheson, the director of the sports medicine department at
   Stanford University, testified as an expert in medical conflicts of
   interest Monday.

   After reviewing testimony and evidence in the case, Matheson concluded
   that AEG Live created a conflict of interest because the contract it
   negotiated with Murray to serve as Jackson's personal doctor for
   $150,000 a month "was likely to lead to poor medical decisions."

   [43]Promoter deal with Jackson's doctor 'highly innapropriate'

   Matheson, the team doctor for Stanford's athletic department, compared
   it to a football coach telling a team doctor on the sidelines in the
   fourth quarter of a big game that a star quarterback has to go back in
   the game despite a suspected concussion.

   Murray, who had closed his clinics to take the job and was $1 million
   in debt, would be inclined not to resist the AEG Live executives'
   pressure to get Jackson to rehearsals despite evidence of his failing
   health, Matheson testified.

   Murray himself was conflicted because the negotiated contract was
   structured so that he answered to AEG, but it also could be canceled if
   the tour was canceled, he said. "I think that conflict played out as
   Michael Jackson's health began to deteriorate."

   E-mails from the show director Kenny Ortega and production manager John
   "Bugzee" Hougdahl warned AEG executives of Jackson's deterioration
   during June 2009, including indications he was unable to do some of his
   trademark dances or remember lyrics to songs he had sung for decades.

   [44]Jackson lost dance moves in last days

   His makeup artist and a choreographer testified about Jackson's
   paranoia, his talking to himself and hearing voices, and his severe
   weight loss.

   Associate producer Alif Sankey testified that she "had a very strong
   feeling that Michael was dying" after a rehearsal 11 days before his
   death.

   "I was screaming into the phone at that point," Sankey testified. "I
   said he needs to be put in the hospital now."

   Lost battle for sleep

   A Harvard sleep expert testified last week that the nightly propofol
   treatments likely interrupted Jackson's sleep cycle, robbing him of REM
   -- rapid eye movement -- sleep, which is vital to keeping the brain and
   body alive.

   "The symptoms that Mr. Jackson was exhibiting were consistent with what
   someone might expect to see of someone suffering from total sleep
   deprivation over a chronic period," Dr. Charles Czeisler, a Harvard
   Medical School sleep expert, testified Friday at the trial.

   [45]Expert: Jackson went 60 days without real sleep

   If the singer had not died on June 25, 2009, of a propofol overdose,
   the lack of REM sleep may have taken his life within days anyway,
   according Czeisler's testimony Friday.

   Lab rats die after five weeks of getting no REM sleep, he said. It was
   never tried on a human until Murray gave Jackson nightly propofol
   infusions for two months.

   Prince to testify

   Prince will be the only one of Jackson's three children who will appear
   in court, although the video of Paris' deposition over two days in
   March will be seen at some point during the AEG Live defense
   presentation. The company compelled her testimony, calling her a key
   witness to her father's dealings with Murray and to her own
   relationship with her father.

   Jackson lawyers informed the court last week that Paris, 15, would not
   be available to testify in person because she is hospitalized for
   psychiatric treatment after a suicide attempt earlier this month.

   In testimony last week, chef Kai Chase recalled how devastated Paris
   was in the first moments at home when she realized something was very
   wrong with her father.

   "We were literally pulling her by her ankles down the stairs as she was
   trying to go back up, screaming 'Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!'" Chase
   testified.

   [46]Paris, Prince Jackson testimonies shown in Jackson death trial

   Paris made millions cry two weeks later when she spoke at the public
   memorial for Jackson.

   "Ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever
   imagine," she said. "And I just want to say that I love him so much."

   Jackson confided in his son about his business dealings at an early
   age. His testimony is expected to include revelations about what his
   father told him in his last weeks about whom he trusted and distrusted.

   "Prince has always been, even at 12, the little man -- daddy's little
   man," Chase testified. "He wanted his father to be very proud of him,
   which Michael was."

   "The weight of the world is on his shoulders, the eldest, big brother
   and father figure to his siblings," Chase testified. "It's a lot for
   him, growing, liking girls. He wishes his father was here to give him
   advice. It's devastating to him."

   Life after his death

   Jackson died just two weeks before he was to travel with Prince, Paris
   and Blanket to London where 50 concerts were scheduled over the next 10
   months. Their father told them they would go on a long world tour after
   the London shows, which they were excited about, Paris said in her
   deposition.

   After the tour, Jackson intended to buy a mansion in Las Vegas to serve
   as a base while he concentrated on making movies, his children said. To
   prepare them, Jackson hired a film professor from the University of
   Southern California to teach them movie-making techniques in their home
   school.

   With their father gone, the children moved in with their grandmother in
   the same Los Angeles home where Michael Jackson lived at a teen. The
   veil of privacy -- which included wearing masks when in public with
   their father -- was soon replaced by occasional public appearances to
   honor their father.

   The children spoke at the Grammys, a Hollywood Boulevard dedication
   ceremony, a tribute concert and to Oprah Winfrey. In each event, they
   appeared poised beyond their years.

   The two oldest enrolled in a private school, a major change from the
   home tutoring their father provided.

   Prince and Paris have both begun exploring careers in entertainment.

   Prince worked several days as a "special correspondent" for
   "Entertainment Tonight" and acted in an episode of the television show
   "90210." Aunt La Toya Jackson arranged the jobs for him.

   Paris signed up with an A-list Hollywood manager to help with her
   acting career earlier this year, but that's on hold while she is being
   treated.

   Blanket, whose nickname came from the blanket his father often covered
   him with in public, is still taught at home, which is now a big hilltop
   house in a gated Calabasas, California, community.

   "He does dance moves like his father," according to Chase, who was
   rehired as the children's chef last year.

   Blanket, now 11, does "a lot of remembering what daddy did, and it's
   constant nonstop talking of him and his father's relationship
   together," Chase testified last week. He often wears a T-shirt from the
   Cirque du Soleil "Immortal" show based on his father's music, Chase
   said. "He wears it constantly."

   The trial, in its ninth week in a Los Angeles courtroom, is expected to
   last into August, according to lawyers on both sides.
