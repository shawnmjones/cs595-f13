Those who wait the longest to vote

   The fact that voting lines were disgraceful in many parts of the
   country is not new, but there's a growing body of evidence that some
   Americans wait much longer than others. Taegan Goddard at Political
   Wire had [3]this item yesterday.

     A new paper from MIT professor Charles Stewart finds that African
     Americans waited an average of 23 minutes to vote in the last
     presidential election, Hispanics waited 19 minutes and whites waited
     just 12 minutes.

     "While there are other individual-level demographic difference
     present in the responses, none stands out as much as race. For
     instance, the average wait time among those with household incomes
     less than $30,000 was 12 minutes, compared to 14 minutes for those
     in households with incomes greater than $100,000. Strong Democrats
     waited an average of 16 minutes, compared to an average of 11
     minutes for strong Republicans. Respondents who reported they had an
     interest in news and public affairs 'most of the time' waited an
     average of 13.2 minutes, compared to 12.8 minutes among those who
     had 'hardly any' interest."

   Charles Stewart's findings are online [4]here. They help bolster some
   preliminary findings that my colleague Laura Conaway [5]highlighted in
   February.

   In the larger context, there are a few things to keep in mind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   First, Bob Bauer [6]talked to Rachel last night about the new
   presidential commission on improving voter access, and he sees the
   possibility for bipartisan progress on addressing problems like these:
   "I honestly believe that there is room here within the confines of the
   commission's mandate as set out by the president to address these
   issues on behalf of the voters. And on these particular issues, not on
   all issues, but on these particular issues we ought to be able to set
   aside partisan conflict." Here's hoping he's correct.

   Second, if the Republican appointees to the U.S. Supreme Court strike
   down the Voting Rights Act, I hope federal lawmakers will remember
   charts like these when weighing a new legislative remedy to voting
   restrictions.

   And third, to reiterate a [7]recent point from Jamelle Bouie, if GOP
   leaders are sincere about minority outreach, they can start by
   demanding equal voting access for all. How about it, Reince?

   I think charts like that one cause more harm than good. People are
   going to say "waiting 20-25 minutes to vote is not a burden, what
   happened to all those people who supposedly waited for HOURS?" As if
   20-25 minutes weren't the average but the worst-case scenario. Millions
   of people sailed through voting with hardly a wait, but tens of
   thousand of people waited for hours, usually in poorer
   neighborhoods/districts. Average wait times only middy the issue, even
   if it proves black people waited longer than whites. In the 21st
   century no one should have to endure a wait.

   I actually (not supposedly) waited 7+ hours to vote in Aventura,
   Florida. Voter surpression should be a federal crime!!!

   Voter suppression is a crime: [23]Voting Rights Act - which the Supreme
   Court is now considering whether to water down or not. Not vigorously
   enforcing laws prohibiting voter suppression should also be a crime.

   this is a move by the gop to suppress voters for the 2014 elections and
   beyond. you do not leave inner city election halls open as long as
   suburbia. you move voting times around. change the open and closing
   times without due notification. you require voter ids at the last
   minute in an effort to suppress minority turnout. you throw out huge
   blocks of votes from inner city people because of'mistakes'. and the
   beat goes on. if you can't beat them with honesty or logic, because you
   don't have any, lie, cheat, steal, suppress, eliminate. welcome to the
   republican party!

   What we have in Colorado should be the model for the nation. We can
   sign up to vote by mail and the only thing you have to do to stay on
   the mailing list is to vote in every election. We also get what I call
   the little blue book which is a non-partisan booklet which gives the
   pros and cons on ballot initiatives, judges, etc. Thus I get a ballot
   in all elections and I can sit down at my desk with my little blue book
   and mark my ballot. I can then put it in the mail or deliver it to the
   ballot box at the courthouse. We also have early voting.

   This cuts down on how many people go to the polls and lines are short.
   I do not have any statistics about how much this saves/costs the state,
   but I expect it is more cost effective than manning more polling
   places. I do live in a small rural community, and I do not know how it
   works in the big urban areas like Denver.

   It is great for senior citizens. And for small local elections which
   some of us overlook, I get a ballot in the mail to remind me to vote.

   you sir, have a great system. but you cannot influence the vote if
   everyone votes. the gop knows that if they can stop 5 or 6% of
   minorities from voting they can win a lot of elections. and they don't
   care how they stop those people from voting. in states with large inner
   city turnouts the gop usually gets beaten badly. so all over the
   country they are creating' initiatives' to supress minority votes. and
   i believe that anyone who knowingly passes legislation that suppresses
   voting by any group of people is guilty of treason!

   I don't get it.

   How can we tell what race waited longer than some other race?

   Let's say there is a voting center that is in a black community. Not a
   lot of other races will be going there so there's no way to do a
   comparison for places like that (where a huge majority are one type of
   group)

   Also, some voting centers have all types of people there. Do the
   officials hold back the people they deem unworthy and force them to
   wait longer?

   In short:

   If a place has 1000 people in line and 999 are black, the time for
   voting can't be judged on anything other than the time it takes the
   person to vote. And that includes the whole process not just the voting
   part.

   If a place has 999 people voting and 333 are white, 333 are black, 333
   are hispanic...there's not a way to tell what group takes longer to
   vote unless they are purposely being held back.

   These groups are not equally distributed in terms of locality. If they
   were, then yeah, the graphs would suggest that one group was being
   delayed *at the polling station.* I doubt that this is the case [but it
   could be given the new push for certain types of documentation]. No,
   what's probably going on is that voting districts with more African
   Americans are being given fewer resources (e.g., one booth instead of,
   say, four) relative to voting districts that are majority white.
   Whatever the case, in the U.S.A it takes more effort to vote if you are
   African American.

   This isn't by accident. This is by design. In 2004 and 2006, Virginia
   was a solid red state. It took me 5-10 minutes to vote. In 2008 it took
   me 20 minutes. In 2012 it took nearly 2 hours.

   The biggest reason for long lines is that there arent enough polling
   places and not enough voting booths in each polling place. In some
   inner city locations where you have a very dense population you need a
   lot more voting booths to allow for greater thru-put. Yes, this means
   more expense and unfortunately some people dont want to spend the
   money.

   I live in a medium-sized, mostly white suburban town and have voted
   regularly for nearly forty years, and I've never had to wait more than
   five minutes -- not once. We should not be tolerating waits of an hour
   or more.

   Federal courts have not been shy to intervene in state prison systems
   when conditions have deteriorated enough to be considered inhumane. I
   do not see any impediment to a federal court stepping in with
   appropriate remedies for states that have long wait lines for voting.
   It just takes the will of one federal judge to stand up to the state
   and slap them around.

   I don't find this that shocking. Large populations of Whites live in
   rural/suburban areas. So since the population there is smaller, the
   wait is smaller. African Amercians and Latinos have large populations
   in urban areas where the overall population is 10x higher than those in
   suburban areas so the lines would be more crowded. And how did they
   measure this 'wait time' accurately?

   Now, weight that graph by the percentage of each group that have had
   their right to vote taken away (e.g., because of a past crime).

   In Washington State, we have 100% mail-in voting. Voters may register
   in person, by mail, at the DMV or on-line at the Secretary of State's
   website. You can even register via Facebook. Registered voters get
   their ballot well in advance (at least 18 days prior to Election Day).

   There is ample time to review the state provided voter's pamphlet (also
   available on-line) for each issue and candidate. You can also do your
   own independent research. Before putting the completed ballot first
   into the secret envelope and then the return envelope, they must be
   signed under oath by each voter and are then verified at each the 39
   county election departments throughout the state before they counted.
   Your ballot must be postmarked by Election Day or dropped off at
   convenient, secure ballot drop boxes by 8 p.m. election night.

   The free official election results app was the most downloaded election
   results mobile app in the nation. Washington's voter turnout of the
   2012 general election was the highest in the nation at 81%. No lines.
   No wait. No gimmicks by any political faction to impede the process. No
   public spectacle. No drama. Just accessible and thoughtful voting.

   SO Excited to hear you speak in Downer's Grove, Il. I just want to say
   thank you for been our link to the loving and logical news we need here
   in Chicagoland!! My family called Sandy Hook Sandy Hook, Ct home (the
   only hometown my children had ever known) until Aug 2012; my daughter
   and i would both have been in Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14th
   if we hadnt moved to Chicagoland. We lost friends, have friends who
   lost siblings and have been devastated by the events of that tragic
   day. We have been back to CT to our brokenhearted town and my heart
   aches to be there with our friends as they navigate their way to a new
   normal.

   You have handled not only this topic and those intimately involved,
   like Vicki Soto's siblings (she was one of my son's favorite teachers
   at SHS and a wonderful co-worker of mine!) and the Wheelers (my
   daughter was friends with Nate who is now an only child after loosing
   his little brother Benny) with such thoughtful and graceful respect and
   for that I thank you.

   If there is a way to personally express our gratitude to you while you
   are in Chicago, my husband and i would appreciate your time.

   Fondly,

   Barbara Baron
