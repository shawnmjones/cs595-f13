   APR
   First up, affirmative action. [29]Eugene Robinson at The Washington
   Post provides the snapshot:

     The Supreme Court decision on affirmative action could have been a
     lot worse. Given the court's ideological tilt, in fact, it was
     probably the best we could have hoped for. [...] To those who had
     hoped for a more sweeping decision, it may look as if the court
     decided to punt. But my impression is that the ruling represents
     compromise and consensus, with a healthy dose of restraint.

   [30]Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSBlog dives into the details:

     While the ruling was confined to the use of race in admissions to
     state- or local-government-operated colleges, it also has
     implications for the use of race in government job recruitment and
     public contract placement.   And the ruling will put a searching new
     spotlight on a case that the Court has already granted for review at
     its next Term: the constitutionality of a plan approved by state
     voters to forbid any use of race in public college admissions and,
     by implication, in state hiring and contracting. [...]

     Here is the way the opinion recited that ultimate test: "A
     university must make a showing that its plan is narrowly tailored to
     achieve the only interest that this Court has approved in this
     context: the benefits of a student body diversity that encompasses a
     broad array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or
     ethnic origin is but a single though important element." [...]

     Whether a university program that takes any account of race can run
     this legal course and survive, whether at the University of Texas or
     elsewhere, will depend upon cases that are now likely to unfold
     across the country.   There is a strong new incentive for opponents
     of "affirmative action" in college admissions to test virtually
     every such program; indeed, in some ways, the tone of the opinion
     would seem to invite such further testing.

   [31]Bloomberg's editors find the decision "unsatisfying" but breathe a
   sigh of relief that affirmative action wasn't banned outright:

     There will come a day when the U.S. Supreme Court decides that
     affirmative action is no longer constitutional. The question is
     whether that day comes before or after the rest of America decides
     that affirmative action is no longer necessary.

     All that's certain is that neither day is today.  [...] Although
     support has been declining for years, the American people are pretty
     much evenly divided on the need for it.

   More analysis below the fold.

   [32]Pat Garofalo at US News looks at the other SCOTUS decision that
   came down in which the Court chose to side with businesses over
   employee rights:

     The Supreme Court today - in a 5-4 decision - delivered another
     victory to corporate America. In Vance v. Ball State University, the
     court made it more difficult for employees to sue their employers
     over harassment in the workplace, the latest instance in which Chief
     Justice John Roberts and the court's conservatives have pledged
     fealty to business interests, to the detriment of American workers.

     In this case, the court narrowed the definition of "supervisor" in
     the workplace, making it so that supervisor means only those with
     the ability to hire and fire. As Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the
     majority's opinion, someone is only a supervisor "if he or she is
     empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions
     against the victim." [...] It's not hard to see the problem with
     limiting "supervisor" to only those who have hiring and firing
     power. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in the dissent, the
     court's decision "strikes from the supervisory category employees
     who control the day-to-day schedules and assignments of others,"
     which "ignores the conditions under which members of the work force
     labor."

   And, of course, don't forget to read [33]Adam Bonin's excellent
   analysis:

     In a pair of 5-4 decisions handed down Monday morning, a
     conservative pro-business majority of the Supreme Court of the
     United States has closed the courthouse doors to individuals seeking
     redress against their employers.   [...] In both cases, the U.S.
     Chamber of Commerce sided with the corporations, bringing its record
     to 13-3 this term. (Good enough for a first-round bye, because
     clearly the Chamber has home-field advantage before the Supremes.)
     And in both cases, this will lead to fewer lawsuits trying to hold
     employers accountable--indeed, in Dr. Nassar's case, the five
     conservative Justices openly decry just how many retaliation
     lawsuits are filed, and cheer on the closing of the courthouse doors
     to these victims.

   [34]Dana Milbank:

     The most remarkable thing about the Supreme Court's opinions
     announced Monday was not what the justices wrote or said. It was
     what Samuel Alito did.

     The associate justice, a George W. Bush appointee, read two
     opinions, both 5-4 decisions that split the court along its usual
     right-left divide. But Alito didn't stop there. When Justice Ruth
     Bader Ginsburg read her dissent from the bench, Alito visibly mocked
     his colleague.

     Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the high court, was making
     her argument about how the majority opinion made it easier for
     sexual harassment to occur in the workplace when Alito, seated
     immediately to Ginsburg's left, shook his head from side to side in
     disagreement, rolled his eyes and looked at the ceiling. His
     treatment of the 80-year-old Ginsburg, 17 years his elder and with
     13 years more seniority, was a curious display of judicial
     temperament or, more accurately, judicial intemperance.

   Switching topics, [35]Jason Warner at The Boston Globe examines the
   context of President Obama's trip to sub-Saharan Africa:

     PRESIDENT OBAMA'S first major trip to sub-Saharan Africa on
     Wednesday is expected to cost from $60 million to $100 million,
     prompting many calls for the president to cancel his trip. Yet, such
     opposition is shortsighted: Now, more than ever, the United States
     cannot afford to ignore Africa.

     Geopolitically, Africa is an emerging force to be reckoned with.
     Economically, it hosts several of the world's fastest growing
     economies -- including Rwanda, Zambia, and Mozambique -- while the
     continent as a whole is expected to outstrip global growth for at
     least the next three years. Simultaneously, the rise of
     fundamentalist actors hostile to US interests -- especially in
     Somalia and Nigeria -- means that the continent presents
     unprecedented exigencies in the security realm as well.

   On the topic of immigration reform, the other big topic of the week,
   [36]Jay Bookman at The Atlanta Journal Constitution points out that
   immigration foes are "down to just one argument" now that the
   heavy-handed Hoeven-Corker amendment is on the table:

     the excessive, flamboyant nature of the Hoeven-Corker approach is
     its entire point. Yes, people like Rand Paul and John Cornyn can and
     will continue to claim that they oppose the overall immigration bill
     because it just isn't tough enough on border security. But with this
     amendment now part of the bill, any plausibility that excuse might
     once have had is gone.

     If you oppose the Senate bill, even after all this, you oppose it
     because you oppose a path to legitimacy for the 11 million or so
     illegal immigrants in this country. Period. If you oppose the Senate
     bill, you cast your lot with Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin and other
     hardliners who offer no solution to the problem other than keeping
     those people in the shadows as a permanent underclass for the rest
     of their lives.

   Finally, [37]Adam B. Wolf at The Los Angeles Times draws attention to
   student loan debt crisis:

     Cable news channels regularly stoke their viewers' fears about China
     holding $1.1 trillion of U.S. debt. But they're focused on the wrong
     $1.1 trillion of loans.

     The borrowers of this other $1.1-trillion debt are far more likely
     to default on their obligations: students, particularly those who
     went to for-profit colleges. The global consequences could be -- and
     likely will be -- staggering.

     More than 38 million Americans have student loans outstanding. To
     put this in perspective, 38 million is the combined population of
     New York and Florida. And this collective debt is on par with the
     entire GDP of Mexico.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Congress clearly has the constitutional authority to regulate
       congressional elections. I could see a situation where preclearance
       remains in place for congressional elections and does not apply to
       state & local elections. For example, Congressional redistricting
       would still need to be pre-cleared, but state legislature
       redistricting wouldn't.

       gives us an entry titled [179]Top Ten Ways U.S. TV News Are
       Screwing Us Again on NSA Surveillance Story, subtitled "Iraq
       Redux".  This entry was posted yesterday morning, so scroll down
       past other entries.  Always insightful, Cole lists ways that the
       media is skewing or omitting information on the NSA story, some of
       which we were already aware of, some new, that impugn the U.S.
       government's case, and how this all sounds very familiar.  Here's
       one from the list we may not have known about:

     Ignore important breaking stories that impugn the government case.
     For instance, The Guardian broke the story Saturday morning that the
     NSA PRISM program was small compared to the TEMPORA program of GCHQ,
     its British counterpart, which Snowden alleged has attached sniffers
     to the fiber optic cables that stretch from New York to London, and
     is vacuuming up massive amounts of email and telephone
     conversations. A Lexis Nexis search in broadcast transcripts for
     Sunday showed that no US news broadcaster mentioned TEMPORA or GCHQ.
     This was true even though the NSA has 250 analysts assigned to
     TEMPORA and even though that program sweeps up and stores exactly
     the kind of material (telephone calls, emails) that President Obama
     denied were being collected.

       thankful for; as for me, I rejoice that I am not a Republican." -

   Two cases in 2007 - Seattle (high school) and Louisville (kindergarten
   placement) cases in Roberts' first term - signaled the death knell to
   using racial preferences even as just one factor in balancing school
   enrollment based on race.

   (Susan Coyle's new book, The Roberts Court: The Struggle for the
   Constitution, devotes the first third to these cases, and to the
   efforts of conservative activists to take advantage of the shift toward
   further conservatism after Alito's ascendency to SCOTUS.)

   If there's any appreciable hope in this current case, I'm having a hard
   time seeing it.

   Affirmative Action, why don't they talk about the state of elementary
   and secondary education, because that is the real, underlying issue.
   If we had equality at the pre-university level, we wouldn't have to
   take steps to improve it at the university level.

       With it turning out  that the BOLO lists targeted pretty much the
       entire political spectrum, there is just no story there. At all.
       Actually, that's not entirely true. The real story is that the
       Republicans have known the truth about this and continued to lie to
       try to smear the administration, but that won't have any legs in
       the media because it doesnt bleed. So as much as Republicans try to
       spin it as Obama trying to stifle dissent, it's just not there.

   and this is vividly illustrated by the juxtaposition of the affirmative
   action and discrimination-retaliation cases. The affirmative action
   case, involving a high visibility "hot button" issue, was decided so as
   to maximize the Court's institutional credibility by simply
   "clarifying" its previous affirmative action cases. But when the issue
   was more "below the radar" and touched directly on the corporate bottom
   line and managerial power, there was no hesitation to deliver the goods
   for corporate power, even with a deeply split decision.

   Chief Justice Roberts is a remarkably skilled and committed advocate
   for the Chamber of Commerce, both as a lawyer and on the bench. He will
   carefully maintain and build the Court's institutional credibility,
   even at the expense of right wing social issues, so that the court can
   deliver for corporate interestes when it counts.

   There are still too many white non-Hispanics who believe that their
   kids are more entitled to an education than other kids.  They know who
   they rose to the middle class, and that a college education means their
   kids are more likely to stay there.

   The reason that AA is being fought against, again, is because it is
   going to make a difference.  Black and Hispanics are over 10% of the
   population, and much more at the college age.  Asians are coming up to
   10%.  Whites non-Hispanics are falling to 50% or below.  In Texas where
   the case originated White non-Hispanics are greatly outnumbered by
   everyone else at the college age.

   If we assume that white non-Hispanics are not better, are not smarter,
   and should be represented at the same rate of the population, should
   not be entitled to a college education, should have to compete on a
   level playing field, then there are white non-hispanics who are not
   going to college.  Some who may have be equally qualified, some who may
   have gone when there was less competition from students who were
   willing to work harder.

   As I mentioned before, the father of an entitled white girl who threw a
   fit because she thought she was entitled to an education, even if a
   more qualified person was denied an education, stated on a local radio
   interview that he had not problem with other going to college, but
   there should be other colleges that they could go to. This was not
   about fairness, this was about University of Texas for the entitled
   white non-Hispanics.  A degree from UT for TAM, in Texas at least,
   means money, and allowing minorities to go there dilutes the population
   of who makes money, and, frankly, makes discrimination more difficult.

       Back when affirmative action first appeared, it was within the
       context of a nation in which white anglos were a large majority and
       everyone else was a minority, and the anglos controlled everything,
       legally as well as culturally. That nation is fast disappearing,
       however, as simple demographics turns what was once an anglo
       majority into just another minority which, despite the efforts of
       the diehards, simply cannot keep cultural or legal power any more.

 be careful ([335]0+ / 0-)
       It is statements like this that keep conservatives competitive
       nationwide and especially in Texas where this generation of
       'minorities' tend to educated and often, though certainly not
       always, grown up expected to be treated on their ability to do an
       days work rather than the color of their skin.
       To many it sounds like a code, no matter how carefully stated, that
       white people are willing to share, but not relinquish entitlement.
        In this case, a qualified student was accepted to school over an
       equally qualified white person.  Under traditional rules the white
       student would be accepted.  Under new rules in which we try to make
       colleges more representative of the populous the white student was
       rejected.  This is a bad thing because it entitles the non-white
       person.
       We also see this in redlining, which a few years ago prevented a
       friend of mine from buying a house.  If he had been allowed to move
       his family to where he wanted, the entitlements of the white
       non-Hispanic people to live a segregated neighborhood would have
       traded for his his kids to have the unfair advantage of a good
       school.

       A supervisor makes $200K and get a 2% raise to $220K.  A worker

       the raise that his boss did, but the greedy bastard still claims he
       cannot feed his family.  What is wrong with him?
       Due to the evidently unconstitutional AA, UT is making progress.
       The student population is about half whitenon-hispanic, about a
       fifth hispanic, and about 5% black.  Another reason is that those
       graduating in the top 10% of a high school achieves automatic
       admission to state schools.  This, along with nothing else, achieve
       equity in the school but not in a particular college.
       Even with no growth, assuming that white non-Hispanics are not
       inherently more entitled or deserving of a college education, there
       is going to have be double in the representation of these groups.
       It is interesting to note that many smaller urban schools has

       have 'given the CHinese' still doesn't impact his providing us with
       proof of rampant and pervasive unconstitutional crap.
       All this focus on Snowden simply detracts from the more important
       topic.
       Which happies our government. They want Snowden to be the topic and
       for people to forget the real shit that is going on.
       If he shot and killed somebody to get the same info, I'd be fine
       with him being charged with murder but that would not in any way
       reduce the vast importance of what he brought to us.
       If he gave the ENTIRE PRISM program to the CHinese, that would be
       espionage and he could riot in hell for it - doesn't change the
       nature of the information he provided us.
       The most important part of this entire issue is the assault on the
       constitution and that is what he has provided us: evidence its
       real.
       I do not care about the peripheral stuff.

 Snowden is a complete disctraction ([441]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [442]a2nite, [443]xxdr zombiexx

   to the real issues- he's not a hero or a swine, he's just a messenger.
   The obsession with Snowden and where he is or is not really obscures
   the issues about the violations of privacy and rights going on in this
   country.

 Read the Quote ([447]0+ / 0-)

   According to unnamed intelligence sources the Chinese "drained" his
   computer while he was in his hotel. Gotta trust them. Meanwhile the New
   York Times said:

   "Staying cooped up in the cramped Hong Kong home of a local supporter
   was less bothersome to Mr. Snowden than the prospect of losing his
   computer."

   This was after Snowden was in the hotel. So, he was still in possession
   of his computer. I call BS.

 One thing America seems very commited to ([451]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [452]MsPlasmodesmata

   is to NEVER do the right thing in a timely manner, to put it off as
   long as possible and then implement it as peicemeal as possible.

   Why is the right thing so politically unpopular and why do americans
   tolerate it like trained dogs?

   That shit Texas GOP pulled with abortion law SHOULD have precipitated a
   riot, but no.

   I know 'riot' is something were not supposed to say, but really, this
   is our only life and those assholes are powerfucking it while we just
   stand here and carp about votes and petitions and shit.

   It's like "ignoring bullies" - it DOESN'T work.

   One thing 'helps' a bully to rethink their ways.

       at the State House before that legislation was passed (it's not
       over, there's another bill being voted on today).
       For Texas, that's pretty impressive.
       For all that, the gerrymandering practically ensures a Republican
       majority for the near future.
       Of course, if they keep pulling this crap, a purple Texas might
       come sooner than you think.

       People are all sensitive about "acting up" but the GOP is banking
       solidly on people remaining nice and pliable.
       As 'proper' avenues are closed, the last resport comes into view
       even if it is not supposed to be talked about for various and
       sundry reasons.
       The GOP banks on push never coming to shove.

       They are banking on their republican constituents being nice and

       I saw a comment on an article about the protests from a woman who
       lived in Austin and hadn't heard a word about the protests on the
       news. Imagaine that?

   If the African continent were a single nation, it's billion people
   would place it right behind China and India.

   More to the point: Africa is a continent of waking nations, and waking
   nations prosper, and prospering nations buy cars and do things that
   spur economies but also emit greenhouse gases and increase competition
   for scarce resources.

   "...someone is only a supervisor 'if he or she is empowered by the

   [...]"

   This description is not only staggeringly stupid, it belies a profound
   disconnect between the the right-wing Justices and reality.Apparently,
   I should tell my lab manager that she can harass and defame the
   research associates (whom only I can hire or fire) all she wants,
   because it won't count.

   What an utterly foolish definition of "supervisor."

 Will it apply to public employees? ([485]0+ / 0-)
       When I started teaching in 1976, my principal blatantly harassed
       first year female teachers--to the point of "you'll do this or
       you'll get a bad evaluation" type of harassment.  Now we hear all
       the time that teachers cannot be fired--which is not true but
       principals can evaluate a teacher such that the school system fires
       them.  The union provides due process but the system fires a
       teacher.  Fortunately the union stepped in the help 4 of us and the
       principal ended up being transferred.
