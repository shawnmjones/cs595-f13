Nervous GOP staffer: 'Climate change is real'

   Associated Press

   Real Clear Science published [3]an interesting item the other day under
   a headline that read, "How the GOP Could Win the Climate Debate,"
   written by someone named "Eric Bradenson."

     Someone in the GOP needs to say it: conservation is conservative;
     climate change is real; and conservatives need to lead on solutions
     because we have better answers than the other side. [...]

     Republicans don't have to choose between conceding to the left and
     denying the science. There are genuine pro-growth solutions that
     align with conservative values. Republicans can admit that 97
     percent of scientists just might be right without having to embrace
     Democratic ideas that would grow government.

   Given the prevailing winds, anytime a Republican is willing to break
   with climate deniers and acknowledge global warming, it's a refreshing
   change of pace. But there's something unique about this piece in
   particular.

   As Joe Romm [4]noted, "Eric Bradenson" isn't the writer's real name;
   it's a pseudonym. In fact, the author needed to use a nom de plume, he
   said, "to protect his boss and himself."

   Got that? In 2013, with the threats posed by the climate crisis
   intensifying, a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill is only willing to
   acknowledge reality if he can do so pseudonymously.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romm added that article "was awarded second place in the 'Young
   Conservative Thought Leaders' contest from the Energy & Enterprise
   Initiative at George Mason University." The organizers at the
   Initiative agreed not to publish the author's real name "for job
   security reasons."

   In other words, to write a piece making the case that Republicans can
   "win the climate debate" by pushing conservative solutions to a real
   problem, is to put one's job in Republican politics in jeopardy.

   This really isn't healthy.

   The authoritarian nihilism that calls itself conservatism today is not
   conservative in either the American or the European sense. It cares
   neither for the heritage of the past nor respecting settled traditions.
   It worships power, and domination. It is our version of the political
   perils from the right that Europe went through after World War One.
   Over there some nations survived and some succumbed.

   The jury is out over here.

   ¿"It can most accurately be called pseudo-conservative -- I borrow the
   term from the study of The Authoritarian Personality published five
   years ago by Theodore W. Adorno and his associates -- because its
   exponents, although they believe themselves to be conservatives and
   usually employ the rhetoric of conservatism, show signs of a serious
   and restless dissatisfaction with American life, traditions and
   institutions"

   "Their political reactions express rather a profound and largely
   unconscious hatred of our society and its ways -- a hatred which one
   would hesitate to impute to them if one did not have suggestive
   clinical evidence ... The pseudo-conservative, Adorno writes, shows
   'conventionality and authoritarian submissiveness' in his conscious
   thinking and 'violence, anarchic impulses, and
   chaotic destructiveness in the unconscious sphere...... The pseudo
   conservative is a man who, in the name of upholding traditional
   American values and institutions and defending them against more or
   less fictitious dangers, consciously or unconsciously aims at their
   abolition.'"

   The real game changer is Lac-Megantic, Quebec. The oil train derailment
   that destroyed the town and killed over 50 people because a 72 car
   train with a single engineer was parked for the night and not enough of
   the brakes were set. It was an American owned train, probably carrying
   Koch fracked oil, and definitely with the Kochs approach to workers ---
   have as few of them as possible, no matter what the safety concerns.

   Don't look for the Keystone Pipeline to be approved any time soon.

   Even Texas and Oklahoma are feeling the effects of the "non-existent"
   climate change. Maybe, just maybe, the Kochs will back off a bit, but
   don't count on it.

   After all, their Stand your Ground law passed a major test with the
   Zimmerman not guilty verdict.

   Hail to the Kochs and their magnificent ALEC operation!!!!

   Plan to go to Wal-Mart anytime soon? Don't! It's Koch infested.

   This is an admission of nothing. "might" be right? If you could
   actually find a Republican of substantial notoriety and position to
   admit out-right, without using a fake name to protect himself, that
   climate change due to man's carbon-industrial/corporate footprint is
   real, then this "Eric Brandensen" article is pure B.S.. Young

   Energy and Enterprise Initiative is the organization launched by former
   SC congressman Bob Inglis. The entire purpose of the organization to
   promote pricing carbon pollution as a conservative solution to climate
   change. There are others like R Street, a libertarian think tank spun
   off from the notorious Heartland Institute and ConservAmerica, the
   national grassroots organization of Republicans for environmental
   protection. The Christian Coalition's Michele Combs launched Young
   Conservatives for Energy Reform. They're out there...but they haven't
   received funding like left-of-center groups or people (ex. McKibben).
   And it's a sure bet major GOP donors, like those from the fossil fuel
   industry, won't be donating to those groups anytime soon.

   The problem is the 'better answers' consistent with free market
   ideology are to tax carbon emissions at a rate commensurate with the
   costs associated with mitigating its impacts. In economics this is
   called a 'Pigovian Tax'. Pigovian Taxes are used to introduce and
   reform market pricing for an activity that is inadvertently subsidized
   by the public, such as pollution discharges and impacts on public
   infrastructure caused by traffic congestion, etc.

   Such taxes would include taxing fossil fuels and farming and land
   development practices that lead to degradation of topsoil, which is a
   leading contributor to increased CO2 emissions.

   (All that dark, spongy, organic matter in topsoil is converted to
   carbon dioxide when the soil is washed into a river. This is why rivers
   have sand bars, not soil bars, following each spring flood -- the sand
   is all that is left from the top soil.)

   (Soil erosion is a BIG problem -- imagine the amount of carbon in
   several feet of topsoil spread out over the entire Midwest.)

   GOP are fans of giving businesses a free ride. They are not fans of
   businesses paying for the impacts of what they do.

   Conservatives do have some interesting, market based ideas. Like Cap &
   Trade. That was the conservative plan. Give companies an economic
   incentive not to pollute and effectively tax those that do and let the
   market decide what it's worth. Wonder what ever happened to their
   support of that idea?

   It's kind of like how they had an interesting, market-based idea for
   health care of creating public exchanges where individuals could buy
   coverage from a range of competing companies, while using an individual
   mandate to ensure fair participation and personal responsibility. I'm
   sure they still back that concept, right? Right? Why are you laughing?

   Here's an example of a "pro-growth" climate change policy that
   Republicans could have latched onto not that long ago. It was actually
   set up in that bastion of commienism, Berserkeley CA:

   The biggest deterrent for most homeowners in going solar is the initial
   expense of getting the equipment, the re-wiring etc., which can run to
   $30K+. So the city council there had the idea that for resident
   homeowners, the city could give a guarantee for a bank loan for that
   expense, with the loan to run with the mortgage (i.e., when the house
   was sold, the new owner would assume the unpaid balance), with the
   requirement that the equipment purchased be "Made in the USA" and that
   the homeowner remain there for five years (to avoid the yuppie
   "flippers").

   Think about it: there's no "government money" being spent, the Made in
   the USA requirement helps build an industry where US companies are
   leaders in innovation, but have problems with sales (this is an old old
   old device for stimulating the manufacturing economy that goes back to
   Hamilton, f'r chrissakes) and has the result of reducing carbon
   emissions and increasing individual freedom (homeowners controlling
   their own energy and selling back the excess to utilities so they can
   increase their non-carbon energy). How much more "Republican" does an
   idea have to get? Do it nationwide, and what do you have? New industry,
   lots of hiring there and in independent small businesses who install
   the equipment, etc., and "energy independence."

   Sadly, this idea makes far too much sense for the modern day
   ignoramuses of the Confederate Corporate Party.

   Great way to get more solar on the market, TC.

   All we have to do to implement it nationwide is convince Republican
   members of the House and Senate that climate change is not a conspiracy
   invented by scientists to waste taxpayer money on thermometers.

   (Are Republican members of the House and Senate really that stupid? The
   answer is a resounding NO, but acknowledging reality has an adverse

   Our county (not Berkeley/Alameda), but a more agricultural zone nearby
   has that program. It is something locals should ask their County/Parish
   Supervisors to put into play.

   It encourages the solar usage, keeps people working, both in
   PG&E/electricity provider and the installers. Best case would be using
   panels made in CA...or encourage their locals to start a manufacturing
   plant for the inverters, wiring, panels, frames, nuts and bolts, even.

   We have just had a decision in a local [97]town to use Clean Energy.

   This can be done if we urge the locals to act or act ourselves.

   It is clearly a larger problem, but getting more people to find ways of
   accomplishing clean energy, rather than nixing it is called for.

   Some towns have solar panels on the rooftops of their buildings.

   I have solar panels on my rooftop. It feels good to do something about
   it, but if you can't yourselves, advocate for your locals to find ways
   that would work, not just say no and deny.

   Even if it is just for good health of people, this could lead to a
   larger solution with the added bonus of jobs. There can be jobs that do
   not come from oil pipelines and fracking operations. Not doing one
   thing in oil, coal or natural gas, where water is contaminated and
   wasted does not mean no jobs, it means different jobs.

   The right no longer has any credibility with anyone but the

   Does it really matter if a politician here or there -- be this
   individual conservative, pseudo-conservative, moderate, liberal, etc.
   -- realizes the dangerous reality of climate change?

   These days, a US politician's one and only job is to raise money in
   order to stay in office. The two most successful tactics for this are:
   (1) placate wealthy sponsors, or (2) threaten wealthy sponsors.

   The wealthiest of any politician's sponsors for the foreseeable future
   will be those in the energy industry, and ascendant energy sources are
   currently very bad for the environment. Anyone with fingers in coal,
   oil, natural gas, and similar energy-related products (automobiles,
   shipping, etc.) will deny climate change for vital business reasons.

   So a politician can either kill any legislation that might alleviate
   climate change, or he can push such legislation for the purpose of
   being paid to relinquish it. Any politician who doesn't take advantage
   of such tactics will lose elections to those who do.

   The result is that nothing will change in US politics... while
   catastrophic changes develop in the environment.

   greenhouse gases or reducing our dependence on fossil fuels? Could any
   of them bring up subsidizing green energies, such as wind or solar,
   like they subsidize Big Oil? Give me a break.

   [If true this probably will open up a Senate seat in Oklahoma as James
   Inhofe will have a heart attack and keel over, shocked at the heresy
   now lurking in the republican party]

   Just goes to show folks, this current TPub bunch, even before TP sre
   not conservative, they should stop saying they are.

   They are wholly owned corporate shills. Bowing to oil, coal and gas
   corps. They keep building that empire, which is far from conservative.

   Barry Goldwater would scold these people, shaming their use of
   religion/religious people to gain power.

   "Conservation is Conservative" is a trademarked slogan for
   ConservAmerica (aka Republicans for Environmental Protection).

   I gave that an up, because I hope to see that group strengthened.
   Conservatives cannot deny the conservation of resources is
   conservative.

   The EPA is about preserving resources, keep the land from being
   consumed and eroded, the water clean, air breathable without harmful
   increases of PPM particles or gases. Removing all the trees without
   replanting as they go has to stop.

   My Dad was fairly conservative. He died from lung disease, living in an
   area where concentrated pollution was a known problem. The steel mill
   employed people, but there were 2 smoke stacks going constantly, plus
   the cars we dearly love were increasing with population increasing, the
   highways grew.

   We need to limit pollution and find solutions where we keep cars but
   use cleaner emissions, use mass transit to keep cars from idling in
   traffic jams, stop contaminating water, which we need to live, air we
   need to live.

   This is absolutely something government should do.

   My problem is Republicans are all about deregulating commerce and
   promoting corporate profit at all costs. Abolish the EPA calls are
   heard.

   If we are going to say free market, then promote some corporations to
   trample over us, that is not free market any more. At least hold them
   to standards that do not pollute the essentials and say let's reverse
   the damage we've done.

   These "conservatives" are not conservative, they are enablers of
   rampant pollution, dangerous activities, oil spills, earth, water and
   air contamination.

   That is the kind of conservatism I can embrace, not what is passed off
   today with privacy, peoples bodies and their family make-up- being the
   states' business, state sponsored discrimination/outright control of
   people is not something I can ever embrace.

   p.s. They seem a little like Log Cabin Republicans to me.

   So, my best hope is for a total spin off from the TPubs than would be a
   counter to the phony conservatives we have. That party is beyond
   comprehension for me to have anything to do with them.

   Their issues would hopefully not be treated as some fake Green claim in
   products that are not really Green.

   Here is the pattern that is being followed by Americans at large, sans
   scientifically literate Americans: deny the climate is changing...admit
   the climate is changing but humans have nothing to do with it...oh
   crap, the climate is changing, and we are at fault. We as a country are
   at part II, and I hope it is not too late before we get to part III.

   The only good thing that could possibly come from a Republican winning
   the white house in 2016, and I choke when I say this, is that said
   Republican could claim Climate Change as their issue and run with it.
   Do I hold out hope for this...nope. But if Hillary, and Elizabeth or
   any other Democrat wins the white house in 2016, we can expect more of
   the same. Yes the black guy would be out, but think about it, did they
   treat Clinton any better?

   Still, climate Climate Change (upper case intended) is the overriding
   and most important issue of our day that almost nobody is willing to do
   anything about. Even Obama was late on the issue, and it is yet to be
   seen if he will follow through on his proposed actions.

   When Mitt Romney was in the primaries and admitted what every leading
   science organization in the world has stated; Global Warming is real
   and caused by human emissions, Rush L. cried that his run for President
   was over. So the next day he retracted his statement and was lying to
   get the GOP on his side.

   Sad for America

   A "conservative" solution would be pricing pollution and adding it to
   the cost of any and all products and services. This added cost to
   energy production would level the playing field across the entire
   sector. Instead the argument is being framed, in the fossil fuel world,
   as a "carbon tax". A semantic sleight of hand that diverts the eye from
   the subsidy, that not paying for the damage a product does, truly is.
