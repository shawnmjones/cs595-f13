     * Today's [29]comic by Jen Sorensen is [30]A well-funded militia:
       [31]Cartoon by Jen Sorensen - A well-funded militia
     * [32]119,000 U.S. solar workers outnumber nation's coal miners:

     There are more solar energy workers in Texas than there are
     ranchers. In California, they outnumber actors, and nationwide,
     America has more solar workers than coal miners.
     * [33]Arizona representative who once voted for DOMA getting married
       to a man: Former Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe--who in 1996 voted for
       the Defense of Marriage Act and then, with the knowledge he would
       soon be outed by The Advocate for his hypocrisy, announced he is
       gay--will marry his long-time partner in May.

     Kolbe's come a long way since voting for DOMA, as has public opinion
     (not to mention France and Delaware, each of which legalized
     marriage equality earlier today)... but his party hasn't. The vast
     majority of Republicans in Congress are still hateful and virulent
     homophones -- or at least pretending to be -- and oppose marriage
     equality and immigration equality.
     * [34]FBI backlash 'risks turning US into surveillance state':

     As questions continued to be asked about what the FBI knew about his
     older brother Tamerlan, experts close to the intelligence
     establishment say there is widespread misunderstanding of what it
     would take to put all tip-offs about radical individuals under close
     surveillance.

     Philip Mudd, a former FBI senior intelligence adviser, said there
     was a risk of a backlash turning the US into a "surveillance state".
     * [35]New bird flu strain called "one of the most lethal" of its
       kind. The strain has killed 22 in China:

     The H7N9 flu has infected 108 people in China since it was first
     detected in March, according to the Geneva-based WHO.

     Although it is not clear exactly how people are being infected,
     experts say they see no evidence so far of the most worrisome
     scenario -- sustained transmission between people.

       finger on the pulse of what's new and exciting:
     * [37]Studies indicate that humans feel empathy for robots.
     * On the latest #TWiBRadio, we discuss how  [38]Rand Paul lies,

       contributors and staff writers from the Angry Black Lady Chronicles
       and Jack and Jill Politics.
     * [40]"It's been cordial"? That's what George W. Bush says of his
       post-presidential relationship with Dick Cheney, the guy who
       hand-picked himself to be vice president:

     "You know it's been cordial -- but he lives in Washington and we
     live in Dallas," Bush replied, sitting next to his wife, Laura. "One
     of the saddest things about departing Washington is that you miss
     your pals and a lot of people were there for all eight years and I
     became good friends with them, like Vice President Cheney."

     Bush, apparently feeling the need to say more, continued about the
     man widely seen as the most powerful vice president in American
     history: "You know, I just I don't see him -- much. And I don't see
     many of the people I worked with much and it's kind of sad. It's
     great to be in Texas, however."
     * [41]Rios Montt genocide trial in Guatemala still in limbo.
       Eighty-six-year-old Efrain Rios Montt has been on trial for his
       role as president of Guatemala in the early 1980s in ordering and
       carrying out the slaughter of large numbers of Maya-Ixil Indians.

     On Tuesday, the Constitutional Court issued decisions on some, but
     not all, of the pending legal challenges which have left the
     Guatemalan genocide trial at a temporary standstill.

     The Constitutional Court decisions only added to the suspense
     created last week when, on April 18, Judge Patricia Flores abruptly
     annulled the oral phase of the trial even though more than one
     hundred witnesses and experts had testified and a final verdict was
     believed imminent. In her order, Judge Flores instructed that the
     process revert back to its November 23, 2011 pre-trial status,
     before her earlier recusal from the case. The trial court
     immediately rejected this annulment order as illegal, and suspended
     the trial pending constitutional review, which the trial court --
     and the public -- still await.
     * [42]Conservative group Photoshops a white-wash:

     A conservative group connected to Colorado's Secretary of State has
     been sending political mailers -- including a picture of a
     darker-skinned woman whose face was digitally removed and replaced
     with a white woman's face -- in an attempt to oppose a landmark
     voting bill that may soon become law.
       The bill would establish election-day registration, mail ballots to
       every registered voter and set up a real-time database to detect
       and prevent fraud.

       On today's [44]Kagro in the Morning show, we had to start off with
       the TX gun "instructor" who basically decided he could hold a gun
       class anyplace he didn't see anybody around. Then, into the weeds
       on budget procedure, as Republican bleating for a Senate budget is
       met by... filibustering the conference motion on that budget. More
       on Republican backlash against sequestration cuts that make them
       uncomfortable. An explainer of why Harry Reid often switches his
       votes "for strategic reason," but then nothing "strategic" ever
       seems to happen. Finally, a return to that crazy story line about
       the collapse of the global austerity movement.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [55]Tagging tips - [56]Search For Tags - [57]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     Lawmaker Unemployment Hearing Attended By Single Member of Congress
     At Opening

     WASHINGTON -- More than five years since the start of the Great
     Recession, unemployment remains a major economic problem in the
     United States, with long-term unemployment among its most stubborn
     aspects.

     Nobody told Congress.

     A hearing Thursday on long-term unemployment held before the
     19-member Joint Economic Committee began with just a single lawmaker
     in attendance. Panelists testifying on the problem and its potential
     solutions spoke only to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the
     committee's vice-chair, for the first half-hour of the roughly
     90-minute session.

     The all-but-complete absence of congressional interest was first
     documented by National Journal reporter Niraj Chokshi, who tweeted a
     photo of the hearing. Shortly after the photo was posted, several
     other lawmakers did trickle in to participate. Once the hearing had
     been under way for 35 minutes, Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.) and
     Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) had joined, according to Chokshi.
     Eventually Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) also joined.

   After all, the GOP has a Right Wing Propaganda Machine. It is well

   that possibility. What did I do when I was young? I joined Young
   Republicans fall of 1961 at age 20. I took it for granted that I when I
   turned 21 I would be voting in every election, and I have done so, with
   less than a handful of exceptions. It is a weak constituency that votes
   only when fired up. btw I decided about 1967 that I was in the wrong
   party.
   When I say 'vote in every election' that includes Democratic primaries.
   Maybe I choose in the primaries and eliminate in November.

   The FBI didn't just "get a tip" on Tamarlan Tsarnaev. They interviewed
   him in 2011, then flagged his departure to Russia. But they didn't even
   notice when he returned, "because so much time elapsed".

   That's a load of bullshit. The FBI, like the rest of the US
   surveillance state, isn't even deleting the vast records of perfectly
   harmless or otherwise none of their business activity by Americans and
   visitors, after many years. Including this message you're reading now,
   that the NSA is capturing and keeping in vast storage archives paid for
   with your (wasted) money.

   This is the FBI that got a call from its Arizona office warning that
   Arab foreigners were training to fly jet planes, but not takeoff of
   land them, and the FBI just ignored it. Then those people flew jet
   planes into our buildings. And the FBI got its surveillance state.

   One of the signs of a police state is when the police fail to stop a
   criminal they had tabs on already, the police don't pay any price. Or
   get changed at all except to get more power and money.

 the flu virus has spiky proteins on the outside ([464]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [465]alpaca farmer

       the H is for hemagglutinin and the N is for neuraminidase. If you
       see the H and the N referred to, by the way, then we are talking
       about an influenza A strain. A similar virus, influenza B, does not
       get referred to by H's and N's. And only influenza A causes
       worldwide pandemics.

     All influenza A viruses contain hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, but
     the structure of these proteins differ from strain to strain due to
     rapid genetic mutation in the viral genome.

     Influenza A virus strains are assigned an H number and an N number
     based on which forms of these two proteins the strain contains.
     There are 16 H and 9 N subtypes known in birds, but only H 1, 2 and
     3, and N 1 and 2 are commonly found in humans. There are also
     Influenza type B viruses.
       [466]http://wiki.answers.com/...
       If the flu virus circulating is replaced by a different flu virus
       with different proteins, like what happened in 2009 (H3N2 replaced
       by H1N1), the immunity from last year may not help much. And if
       there's a new flu virus out there with Hs and Ns that humans are
       not used to seeing at all, watch out. We could have a worldwide
       pandemic. But for that to happen 1) the virus has to cause disease
       in humans, and B) it has to be easily transmitted form person to
       person as well as III.) it has to be a novel virus that humans
       don't have immunity to.
       All three criteria were met in 2009, but H5N1 bird flu hasn't quite
       learned B). By the way, all flus are bird flus, in the sense that
       birds get them all. Not all are deadly. Not all are catchable by
       humans (we have different receptors than ducks).

   Recommended by:

   Marriages between same gendered people are egalitarian or, at least, it
   isn't immediately obvious who's the boss.
   The proponents of a social hierarchy prefer to argue that the greater
   society is merely an extrapolation from the family unit in which
   dominance is naturally accorded to the male, because he's stronger (or
   likely to kill the young if everybody doesn't obey).  Thus, the
   societal organizing principle is naturally physical force and, physical
   force having been "sanctioned" by nature, so to speak, it doesn't have
   to be excused nor justified by the dominant party actually doing
   anything. Force is the key to authority, superiority and sustenance.
   When force is not the basic organizing principle, then males have to do
   something else to mate and secure sustenance. What a nuisance! And all
   because those homos couldn't leave well enough alone.
