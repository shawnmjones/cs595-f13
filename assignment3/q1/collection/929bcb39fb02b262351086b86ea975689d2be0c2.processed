   Sen. Roger Wicker, official portrait
   A mail center that services U.S. Senate offices intercepted a
   suspicious letter intended for Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) which has
   [30]tested positive for the poison ricin, according to Politico:

     It was not immediately clear when the envelope was received. But it
     arrived in a Senate mail facility, which has now been closed for
     more testing. All congressional mail will now be processed through
     the U.S. House facility.

     The Senate went into recess shortly after 6 p.m. Homeland Security
     Secretary Janet Napolitano and FBI Director Robert Mueller were
     briefing senators on Tuesday afternoon. A DHS official said that the
     briefing was intended to address cyber-security, but that the letter
     involving Ricin came up. [...]

     Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said members were briefed that the
     substance had been found in a letter and a suspect has been
     identified. [...]

     Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) confirmed the letter was
     sent to Wicker's office and said at this point, the incident
     appeared to be a solitary one.

   McCaskill also said that state offices for senators, which receive mail
   directly, were being briefed on what to look out for in mail received.

   There's ongoing discussion in diaries by [31]AlyoshaKaramazov and
   [32]teacherken.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [46]Tagging tips - [47]Search For Tags - [48]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   The only reason Sen. Wicker voted against the filibuster was to ensure
   a debate and during the debate there would be a record of everyones'
   position on gun control. It would be a matter of RECORD! He brags about
   his A+ rating from the NRA and said that he had no intention of voting
   for any changes to the gun control laws. His FB site exploded, however,
   with his base calling him a traitor for not agreeing to filibuster.
   They say he has betrayed the Constitution. You would have to see it to
   believe it. Not saying that the anger displayed on his FB page is the
   source of the letter with Ricin but  he sure made people angry.Other
   than that he is a pretty innocuous, ultra conservative, party line,

   But yes that is where I would be looking.

   The [355]Guardian had an interesting take on what law enforcement like
   the F.B.I. look at and what the press can not speculate on. Granted it
   was about the bombs in Boston, but the same applies here.

   [356]Direct link to the Facebook post.

     But beyond the evidence gathering, investigators will ask whether
     the modus operandi fits any particular group, or suggests one theory
     as more likely than another. In an information vacuum, such
     speculation might seem unwise for the media, but this is exactly the
     process the FBI will be going through as it seeks to narrow the
     boundaries of the inquiry.

     Ricin is easily purified from castor oil manufacturing waste. The
     aqueous phase left over from the oil extraction process is called
     waste mash. It would contain about 5-10% ricin by weight, but
     heating during the oil extraction process denatures the protein,
     making the resultant seed cake safe for use as animal feed. From
     fresh seed, separation requires chromatographic techniques similar
     to other plant proteins.
