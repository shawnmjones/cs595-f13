   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       I just noticed it is spelled Weiner. That is pronounced 'vyner' (y
       as in 'eye'). I suppose it means wine-maker.
       German is a pretty phonetic language.

       The second vowel of two is the one sounded.
       Of course, in American usage things are allowed to get kind of
       strange. Take the name "Rainer," for example. For a German person,
       it is "Ry-ner."  For a French person, it is "Ray-nyay." In this
       country, it is "Ra-neer" for one place and "Ray-nee-er" in another.

 Actually not the second vowel ([175]0+ / 0-)
       It just seems that way to English-speaking people.
       The vowel 'i' is rarely pronounced like 'eye' except in English.

   A Weiner is not a wine-maker (that would be a Winzer = Weinhauer).

   Weiner is not really a German word. If you took it as a word it would
   be roughly the same as whiner, crybaby.

   But I think Weiner is an idiot and am glad I don't have to vote in that
   election. I don't really give a damn about his wiener but this little
   tempest shows exactly the lack of judgment this guy has. He's not
   qualified to be dig catcher let alone mayor of one of the planets

   This continues to be a story only because the media owners are in
   cahoots with the realtor/developers and the rest of the 1% and/or are
   intimidated by Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn.

   Meantime, the media should be devoting as much energy to investigating
   and reporting on Ms. Quinn.

   Her blatant disregard for the results of not one referendum but two was
   unConstitutional -- in America, the voters' will is supposed to matter
   -- but in the Bloomberg/Quinn world, votes and voters are inconvenient
   things; they care only about their personal ambitions and greedy needs.

   During and after the 2009 election, Ms. Quinn and Mr. Bloomberg were
   positioned to squelch any investigation into their flagrantly
   unAmerican, illegal act.   But what they did was tantamount to voter
   suppression and other violations of voters' rights.  And the media
   cared only about the 1% and/or was cowed into providing cover for these
   thugs.

   What we need is a new mayor who will initiate the appropriate
   investigation, sending Ms. Quinn and Mr. Bloomberg and others complicit
   in their self-serving, illicit coup to long-term jail sentences.  What
   we need is a press that does its job instead of paying homage to false
   gods.  We do not need dictators; we need leaders who will serve the
   public interests and restore some sense of democracy to our metropolis.

   I was reading Time magazine yesterday in my doctor's office and found a
   piece about how 'scandals' are giving Weiner and Spitzer plenty of name
   recognition. Maybe sympathy votes.
   I would say protest votes. A vote for Weiner could be a protest against
   the puritan tradition. A vote for Spitzer could be a protest against
   the criminalizing of prostitution.
