   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [49]Tagging tips - [50]Search For Tags - [51]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       there were three simultaneous popes: in Rome, Avignon, and Pisa.
       The first John XXIII was the second and last of the Pisans.
       But I bet you knew that already. ;-)

       Thank you for knowledge new to me, although I guess at some point
       I'd heard mention of Pisa popes, because it did ring distant bells.
        But the specifics were a (ahem) revelation.  I love the fact that
       there were two John XXIIIs, and that the first one was literally,
       historically, a heretic/apostate.  That's strictly a
       religio-political polemic toward the second.

       then anti-Catholic. And you must give it to the diarist since two
       popes at once has not happened in more than 600 years. The
       'distraction' element is indeed there. They need it.
       I am thinking for example, in the lines of...
       How many Popes can you fit in a WW?
       or...if a Pope farts in the forest, did it really happen?
       or...
       and no, I am not an anti-Catholic.

       A joke about farting popes sounds hilarious! Way better than this

 Yeah that wasnt my point... ([186]0+ / 0-)
       Take a stroll trough the comments on this thread... can imagine
       Kossacks making fun of a Sikh's turban? A yarmulke?
       There's a strain of vicious anti-Catholicism that runs through this
       community. People feel free, and are encouraged to, say things that
       are just as hateful as anything the know-nothing's put out a
       hundred some odd years ago.  This poorly drawn, inchoate ( again
       why is it funny?) comic is the latest example...

       I mean a farting Ayatollah has to be funny, not?
       ...mmm...maybe not. Just boring as hell.
       The key to funniness of an idea or a concept is irony, and being
       taken so seriously, Popes can't avoid but lend themselves to
       comedy?
       I think the Dailykos members are quite fair. Tyrant wannabes
       however don' t get support very often, here.
       Plus...the ignoring and the intentional cover up of child abusers
       do not endear anyone to the Kossacs here, including the Pope.
       You can't change the real issue here by yelling " anti-
       Catholicism"
       It is called strawman..

 Now youre being funny ([194]0+ / 0-)
       Wait, the "West" has made fun of Sikhs so the people who otherwise
       pride themselves on tolerance get carte Blanche to serve up bigoted
       comments too?  That's the standard?
       There is no defending the child-abuse scandal. It's despicable.
       For me though I don't think the sins of the church hierarchy make
       it okay for someone to get their hate speech on. Nor do the actions
       of " the west" get expunged by turning the same views on an a
       different target.  Basically you seem to think Catholics aka
       'tyrant wannabes' deserved bigoted jokes because the child abuse
       scandal excuses the jokesters to hate away.
       Does that hold up in analogy for you? Can people make racist jokes
       about Chinese people because the cultural revolution was a hideous

       No. Laughing about multi-Popes or farting Popes is not bigoted. Its

       The crimes of the church hierarchy are so heinous however that they
       should be in jail, forget the joke.

 Didn't work out so well last time... ([233]0+ / 0-)

   Love your stuff...keep 'em coming!

   During the the late 14th, early 15th centuries there actually WERE two
   popes, in what was known as the Great or Western Schism.

   Back then, (back then? even recently!) the Romans thought they had a
   lock on the papacy, so when Gregory XI died, the Romans threw a hissy
   fit when no good Roman was a possibility.

   The cardinals threw them a bone, and elected Urban VI, who immediately
   began pissing everyone off, and went down in history as least likely to
   win a Mary Poppins personality contest.

   The cardinals went off in a huff and elected Clement VII while Urban
   was still kicking and screaming in Rome and took up residence in
   Avignon setting off a nasty battle of one-upmanship in the church that
   eventually had to be settled by outside counseling and mediation.

   There had been a long history of antipopes and unclepopes before then,
   but none had quite the same impact as this.

   Unless of course, you refer to the Great Great Schism which divided the
   churches of East and West over a simple vowel, but that's a bedtime
   story for another time...

   What separates us, divides us, and diminishes the human spirit.

 They've had 3 Popes at the same time ([236]0+ / 0-)

   so this isn't that big of a stretch.

   I doubt the new Pope will be bringing back throwing coins to naked
   prostitutes.
