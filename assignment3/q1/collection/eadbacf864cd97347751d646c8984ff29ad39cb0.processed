Sandy feeling no pressure to move out to sea

   If you've looked at the the forecasting models for Hurricane Sandy,
   like the ones above [3]on Weather Underground, you've no doubt noticed
   the hard left turn in the track that has meteorologists expecting an
   impact in the northeast U.S. It almost looks like an afterthought. At
   35°N latitude it looks like a sure bet for "out to sea" and then,
   suddenly, the fake out move back to the coast. So what's going on
   there?

   And what's more, what's this business of it lingering for so long? The
   AP today explains that it just won't leave, [4]quoting NOAA forecater
   Jim Cisco, "It's almost a weeklong, five-day, six-day event."

   The National Weather Service, in [5]coining the "Frankenstorm"
   designation for Sandy characterizes the whole system as a "hybrid
   vortex" that includes an "amplifying polar trough" and a "high degree
   of blocking from eastern North America across the entire Atlantic
   basin." High degree of blocking?

   Luckily, a line from yesterday's Metropolis blog at the Wall Street
   Journal (which is going with [6]"snor'eastercane") gave me a lead on
   what to look up...
     __________________________________________________________________


     "An increasingly negative NAO pattern is forecasted to become much
     stronger than normal, which will bring a near halt to the normal
     west-to-east movement of storm systems across the U.S. That more
     than anything else will open the door for Sandy to be sucked back
     towards the East Coast."

   [7]NAO is North Atlantic Oscillation.

   It turns out there is a semi-permanent low pressure spot around Iceland
   called "the Icelandic Low" and there's a corresponding semi-permanent
   high pressure spot around the Azores called "the Azores High" (ahem...
   [8]middle of the Atlantic, kind of the same latitude as Portugal).

   A positive NAO means the Icelandic Low is especially low while the
   Azores High is especially high. When that's the case, cold air over
   Canada moves right across toward Iceland (via the [9]prevailing
   westerlies, which for some reason I associate with Vikings). BUT, we're
   looking at an increasingly negative NAO that is expected to be
   especially strong. Negative NAO means that low over Iceland is not so
   low and the high over the Azores is not so high, so "strong" in this
   case means much less contrast between the low and the high.

   This is where things get a little less intuitive for me, but apparently
   without the strong low pressure to motivate those westerlies, cold
   Arctic air just builds up over Canada. I keep seeing the word
   "blocking" but it seems more passive than that. [10]A better way of
   saying it is that it "decreases the pressure gradient across the North
   Atlantic. This decreased pressure gradient results in a slackening of
   the westerlies."

   Anyway, that cold air makes its way down across the U.S. to the
   southeastern states via lower-than-average pressure (this is the trough
   part of the explanation) and the northeastern states end up with an
   especially snowy winter.

   What you don't usually have is a hurricane sitting right in the middle
   of it all. But knowing the dynamics at play, it's easier to see how
   Sandy is hooking back to land and lingering for lack of any strong
   winter westerlies to push it away.

   If I may add, separately, it's interesting to see the relationship
   between the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation. Last
   time I took a deep dive on weird weather (See: [11]Why is Seattle
   getting all of my snow?), Arctic Oscillation figured prominently in
   that explanation as well. It's weird that we are generally familiar
   with the Jet Stream and El Nino and La Nina (and newly, [12]a Derecho)
   but we don't often hear about these oscillations even though they seem
   especially relevant.

   It's worth pointing out that we do sometimes hear about the Bermuda
   High. As far as I can figure, the Bermuda High is the same
   semi-permanent high pressure that defines the Azores High, and what
   it's called [13]depends on where it is over the Atlantic.

   Not linked in the text but also helpful, [14]Wikipedia on NAO, which
   includes perspective on the effect on weather in Western Europe.

   As ever, your expertise in this is likely greater than mine, so any
   further insight you can offer is appreciated. Weather is so
   complicated, with so many variables, I realize it's simplistic to
   single out this particular feature. I'm particularly frustrated that I
   can't find a map of pressure over the Atlantic that clearly shows the
   North Atlantic Oscillation. I get [15]this far and then I'm not sure
   what I'm looking at anymore. Is that because Tony is swirling around
   out there?

   This doesn't have the ocean winds but does show over land:
   [29]http://hint.fm/wind/ You can see the winds in the northeast going
   inland instead of out to sea. Not sure if that's the pattern that is
   caused by this.

   Sharp turn in the other direction? I think this hurricane got a case of

   The blocking high pressure system in this case can be seen most easily
   in the upper portions of the atmosphere. Here's a map approximately
   half-way up 'into the sky' showing the air movement. It is a forecast
   of the air flow around midnight on Tuesday.

   [56]http://mag.ncep.noaa.gov/GemPakTier/MagGemPakImages/gfs/06/gfs_atla
   ntic_096_500_vort_ht.gi

   The dark lines--labelled with numbers like 576 and 570--can be
   visualized as a topographical map representing elevation. So high
   values show the shape of 'hills' (or higher pressure), conversely lower
   values show depressions (lower pressure). The wind at this height in
   the atmosphere flow parallel to these lines as shown by the funny
   looking 'barbs'-- clockwise around high pressure, and CCW around lows.
   Regions of high 'spin' (vorticity in meteorology) appear as solid
   colors of yellow and orange. The location of Sandy is pretty obvious,
   south of Cape Cod.

   With a little imagination you can see that "hill" (high pressure) in
   the top center of this image with winds flowing clockwise around it
   (the barbs help to visualize it). This high is blocking any further
   northward movement of Sandy and is pushing it to the west.

   The usual disclamer: this is a forecast from a weather model to
   illustrate the complex flow patterns surrounding Hurricane Sandy. Don't
   use this image to make critical decisions.

   Frankenstorm? That was just one too many new words, we will need to
   revise the whole Dictionary again. There's quite an extensive new list
   this year, Romnesia was the latest entry, now this one. We are
   celebrating a new tradition here, the sighting of the great wall of
   Haboob. All the women from our tiny village commense to taking our tops
   off and dancing. They can hear the chanting from miles around, Haboob,
   haboob. This may all be blown out of proportion, Sandy is probably just
   experiencing a little PMS. I remember Fox news was quick to point this
   out for us, only women cry and only women bleed. It's okay, there,
   there, give me a break.

   What I wonder is whether this may be related to the warming of the
   Arctic and whether this portends a shutting down of the
   [73]thermohaline circulation. I realize they work on different
   timescales, but it seems to me that a weakening t.c. could reduce the
   Icelandic low.

   Well done, Will! Looks like another late-season wind-and-rain event
   will put my sump pumps to the ultimate test. If the power stays on,
   that is. At least this old house has enough steel beams (boy, was I
   surprised to see those babies!) to endure the last two 'canes, not the
   mention the "little" Virginia earthquake without damage. You know, the
   quake that shut down the Washington Memorial and a nuclear power plant.
   Time to wash everything in sight, move every last piece of loose
   anything out of the garden, give the kittehs spanking clean litter
   boxes, and nose the Prius tight into the carport. At least this one
   will provide some daytime experiences. Hard to feign sleep with all
   that screaming wind, waiting for the next 50-year-old tree to figure
   out where it's going to fall.

   Look, I know people will be seriously endangered by this storm, as will
   I and my neighbors. (My Southern Maryland county cares an awful lot
   about that, being as how it was nearly destroyed by a brutal tornado in
   2002.) But like most scientists, I get a thrill out of Big Nature.
   Physics is beautiful, even when it's destroying things. Used to tell my
   students that, if we knew another 10-km-sized meteor was headed to
   earth (a la Chicxulub), I'd just throw out a towel in the back yard,
   lay on my back with a cold Diet Coke (tm) in hand, and observe the
   fireworks.

   Oh, and early-vote on Sunday afternoon. Natcherly.

   What both the media and the political campaigns need to emphasize is
   that all the people in the northeast where this storm is likely to hit
   need to get to the polls ASAP because a power outage could really
   suppress the vote on election day.

   I had to call the Obama campaign headquarters this morning about a
   contribution that I tried to make yesterday that did not seem to go
   through and I suggested that the President include this as a reason to
   vote early in his radio addresses. I hope Rachel and the other MSNBC
   shows will pick this up and encourage the voters to get to the polls
   before the storm comes in.

   (I live in Colorado and have already cast my vote for Obama and our
   Demo. Congressional candidate.)

   That's a little extreme of the Romney campaign to control weather like
   that and send a hurricane up here to the mostly blueish northeast to
   suppress democrat voting, don't ya think? Shows the lengths they will
   go to.

   Totally not serious folks! But I wouldn't put it past Faux news to use
   this as "evidence" that god is on the side of the GOP.

   Be safe, friends and neighbors.

   Will et al. --

   Just a word on how some counties are doing it right with regard to
   early voting and possible hurricane infringement:

   My State Voting Board is deferring, of course, to the county Boards of
   Election. My county already has a very useful and effective
   Notification System, for phones, e-mails, tweets, etc., of weather,
   power, major traffic, and other short-term emergencies, and our Public
   Information Office has express plans to send out any info re
   changes/cancellations of our early voting on that CNS. They even have
   plans to move the early voting site to the County Emergency Management
   Office, if the original site is threatened. They'll close up only if
   the election personnel must go home to shelter in place.

   I do love Charles County, Maryland! Not even Hurricane Sandy will keep
   this ol' varmint from casting her (early) Blue votes!
