[23]Teachers aren't the only ones giving low marks to Michael Bloomberg's war
on public schools

   New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
   New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has for years been at war with
   his city's teachers union, using the giant megaphone available to him
   as both a billionaire and the mayor of the nation's largest city to
   slam the teachers at every opportunity. But in the past week it's
   become clear that teachers aren't the only ones to have problems with
   Bloomberg's heavy-handedness on education.

   Voters are not too happy with Bloomberg's role in the schools, for one
   thing. The city has mayoral control of education, so he appoints the
   school board. That means that Bloomberg owns education as an issue. He
   even owns mayoral control itself, which was instituted in 2002 at his
   urging, making him the only New York City mayor to have had such a
   large role in the city's education policy. And a [30]new poll from
   Quinnipiac finds that a strong majority of voters wants to move away
   from mayoral control: 63 percent want the the mayor to share control of
   the schools and 13 percent say the mayor shouldn't have any control,
   while just 18 percent say the mayor should keep control. That's in
   [31]sharp contrast to 2009, when 55 percent of voters wanted mayoral
   control to continue.

   It's not just that voters don't want the mayor in sole control of the
   schools, either. The recent Quinnipiac poll also finds that:

     By a 53 - 35 percent margin, voter trust the teachers' union more
     than Bloomberg to protect the interests of public school students.

   That's both a judgment on Bloomberg's recent actions against teachers
   and the context in which the current fights are playing out. And a big
   fight came to a head this week, centering on teacher evaluations.

   Thursday was the deadline for the city and the union to reach an
   agreement on a teacher evaluation plan in order to receive hundreds of
   millions of dollars in state education funding, but the
   [32]negotiations failed. The head of the teachers union said that the
   union had reached an agreement with Department of Education
   negotiators, only to have Bloomberg kill the deal. Bloomberg,
   unsurprisingly, blamed the union, but head below the fold to see how
   his key reason for doing so crumbles when you poke it.

   [33]Bloomberg says that the union's supposedly last-minute insistence
   that the new evaluation system sunset in 2015 would make the entire
   evaluation process "a joke," because "Nobody would ever be able to be
   removed. The law would be gone before the process could finish. It
   would essentially sabotage the entire agreement." But if that's the
   case, then about 90 percent of the school districts in the state of New
   York that adopted teacher evaluation plans have "joke" and "sabotaged"
   plans, because that's how many of them sunset after a similar length of
   time.

   And [34]there are good reasons for them to do that--and good reason to
   question Bloomberg's insistence that the union pushed the sunset
   provision as a way to kill the deal. UFT negotiator Leo Casey writes:

     On the very last line of [35]this section of the draft application,
     the DOE itself had written that the agreement would only last
     through the 2013-2014 school year. The preponderance of applications
     from school districts around New York approved had similar sunset
     clauses: given the sheer complexity of the new teacher evaluation
     systems required by New York State law, they reasoned that it was
     only prudent to revisit their implementation in a year or two. All
     of these applications have been approved by the New York State
     Education Department.

   Michael Bloomberg wants New Yorkers to believe that the teachers union
   cost the city's schools hundreds of millions of dollars by killing an
   agreement with a last-minute demand for a provision that would render
   the entire evaluation system toothless. But Bloomberg is standing
   basically alone in describing the sunset provision that way. He's
   basically saying that we should take his word over the union, a draft
   application from his own Department of Education, and the New York
   State Education Department along with the 90 percent of districts
   including a similar provision in their evaluation plans. That's how
   arrogant, and how accustomed to having the media accept his claims
   without serious questions, Michael Bloomberg is.

   What's more, he expects to get people to blame the teachers union for
   this at the same time as he [36]killed an agreement for principal
   evaluation over the same issue. And at the same time as 8,000 of the
   city's school bus drivers and attendants are on strike because
   Bloomberg refused to try to build any kind of protections for them into
   a bidding process for companies to take over many bus routes,
   particularly ones that service special education students.

   Bloomberg's goal in the school bus strike is to blame the workers for
   wanting to maintain their lavish pay, which starts at $11 an hour for
   matrons and $14 an hour for drivers. What New Yorkers aren't supposed
   to notice is that it's [37]Bloomberg's own policies contributing to
   rising costs. Bloomberg has pushed for more and more charter schools,
   for instance, and "Some 20% of charter students ride school buses,
   compared to just 9% of regular public school kids, according to one
   Independent Budget Office estimate." Additionally, special education
   students, many of whom go outside the city to school, account for an
   overwhelming amount of the cost of busing, and:

     Bus union president Mike Cordiello says many routes are so ineptly
     configured by Tweed bureaucrats that his members run 186 routes
     daily to Westchester County, most of them with 6 children or less
     per bus. There are 25 buses per day to New Jersey, 16 to Rockland
     County, several to Connecticut.

   But as usual, Bloomberg's solutions target workers.

   Michael Bloomberg has pushed for and gotten more and more control in
   his own hands. But that's not enough for him. On top of it, he's trying
   to break anyone who might ever challenge his power, trying to make it
   easier to fire teachers and bus drivers, trying to erase the voices of
   people who work every day with children. New Yorkers aren't going for
   it, but that doesn't mean Bloomberg can't damage the cause of public
   education.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [60]Civil
   Rights, [61]Community, [62]Congress, [63]Culture, [64]Economy,
   [65]Education, [66]Elections, [67]Energy, [68]Environment, [69]Health
   Care, [70]International, [71]Labor, [72]Law, [73]Media, [74]Meta,
   [75]National Security, [76]Science, [77]Transportation, or [78]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([79]California, [80]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Yes to weak candidates... ([164]0+ / 0-)
       ...and in the first election, the Democratic party was divided
       after a nasty (and racially tinged) primary.  I'm not sure about
       the second (though IIRC, the candidate was the loser from the
       previous primary), but in 2009,  Bloomberg spent about a hundred
       million dollars for a stunning 4 point victory over an uncompelling
       candidate who basically didn't campaign.  Also, Bloomberg has spent
       about a quarter billion dollars of his own money on his three
       campaigns; we're basically talking presidential election money (at
       least up until the last 2 or 3 campaigns) spent on buying the
       mayor's office of a large city.

 Important to note ([232]0+ / 0-)

   Mayoral control of the big 5 city school districts in New York (NYC,
   Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany) has been an issue because the
   cities are required to include district funding in their budgets.

   Without mayoral control, they have very little say in how much of those
   budgets the school district commands.

   I'm not saying Bloomberg is right or wrong, just providing some
   background for why mayoral control is even being considered.  Currently
   in the state, only NYC has mayoral control of the school district.

   Mayor Bloomberg gave $200K to the group trying to pass "education

   Idaho Superintendent Luna and enough citizens freaked to get the whole

   Bloomberg's donation was disclosed (along w/Foster Friess?!) by court
   order a couple of weeks before the election. Everyone knew the whole

   for Bloomberg's stance. (Remember, too, that Bloomberg is a died in the

   kinds of supply side myths and scamming systems.)
   Several years ago, Juan Gonzalez exposed the financial incentives for
   the wealthy to target public education with charter school BS. Here:

     "Wealthy investors and major banks have been making windfall profits
     by using a little-known federal tax break to finance new
     charter-school construction," Democracy Now! co-host Juan Gonzalez

       Before running in 2001.  He switched to Republicon because he
       wouldn't be able to get elected with the Democratic field.  He then
       switched to Independent I believe after his 2nd term started.
       He bullied his way into getting "permission" to run for a 3rd term
       from the City Council and his (at that time) hand picked successor
       and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, along with the Council
       passed it (I was one of the Plantiff's in the Class Action suit to
       prevent this but we lost).  Now Quinn who was in 2009 and now in
       2013 planning to run for Mayor is kind of getting brushed off by
       Bloomberg, who has even asked Hillary Clinton to run for Mayor!  He
       even paid off the 5 Republicon leaders to allow him to run on their
       line!
       He has no respect for anyone.  I think you all know about
       Superstorm Sandy which was on Oct 29th.  The Sunday after the storm
       hit, we were supposed to have the NYC Marathon which starts in
       Staten Island and runs through all 5 boroughs.  Staten Island
       looked like a war zone (still does in many places), 35 people
       killed, whole blocks of homes turned into rubble, no electricity,
       no food, flooding all over the Island and the other Boroughs were a
       mess also.  Bloomberg insisting that the Marathon go on.  His
       reasoning, well we had the Marathon 7 weeks after 9/11 so we should
       have this Marathon 6 days after Sandy!  There was such an outcry
       from the public he finally cancelled it but was very angry that he
       had to.

 Her closeness to Bloomberg will be her downfall ([300]0+ / 0-)
       There are basically four Democrats running for the Mayoral
       nomination:
       Quinn:  Too close to Bloomberg; she will be on the defense all
       summer and her numbers will fall
       John Liu: City Comptroller- support of the Asian American
       community, but is being nvestigated about campaign financing
       problems.
       Bill Thompson: Former City Comptroller, lost to Bloomberg in 2009.
        Good guy, would probably make a good mayor, but a little too low
       key, and he had his chance.
       That leaves Bill DiBlasio, the Public Advocate.  Italian American
       with an African American wife; commanding stature- he's about 6'4"
       (I've met him a couple of times); and already has support of some
       unions, including the teachers.

   It doesn't work that way.  Unions are so incredibly under pressure

 Revenue is one aspect to the problem. Income ([393]0+ / 0-)
       disparity is another, and I believe has become the worst problem
       our nation has faced in generations, worse than the late 1920's.
       Once your income nears many hundreds of thousands or millions of
       dollars per day, what tax breaks or deductions could possibly still
       be justifiable?  It serves no substantive societal interest for so
       few to take so much while so many worked to create the wealth and
       end up with little to show for it. They'd still make way more than
       99.99% of us so it's not really a credible 'punishment' that will
       make them give up and stop trying to earn more. If anything, it
       would make them work harder, since they'd still be making more by
       doing so.  A stout progressive tax system just slows the upper
       rates of gain while ensuring a fairer overall distribution of the
       wealth.  America's fastest periods of economic growth occured under
       much higher tax rates than the present.  If the minimum wage
       actually kept up with the cost of living, and maintained a
       plausible ratio with the earnings increases of the rich, it would
       have to be more like $20/hour.  And we'd still be behind other 1st
       world nations in vacation time, maternity benefits, sick days,
       pensions, education benefits, etc.
       The attempts by the richest and most powerful in this nation to
       limit 'sharing the wealth' in the last 4 decades, with their
       increasing demands for cutting worker pay and benefit give
       backs/austerity/etc., has created an increasingly huge disparity
       between America's rich and poor, and now close to half of us are
       near or under the poverty line, even if working multiple jobs, and
       is shredding our social safety net programs.  With so many
       Trillions in our economy, that's a real crime that so few are
       sharing the benefits of the huge productivity our whole society of
       hard workers has enabled.  It's not 'socialism' or 'communism' to
       advocate for more fair and more equal terms in sharing this
       American wealth made possible by the labor of so many--that's just
       advocating we truly share the rewards of hard work with the hard
       workers. We've given away far too much to 'shareholders' and the
       CEO executive class in the last few decades. And they expect us to
       hand over even more. We can say 'No' to the most greedy demands
       with a firm tax reform that brings back progressive income tax and,
       as the bonus, our revenue problems go away while our government
       spends on the programs that benefit the majority of us, not just
       the top 1% of us.

 Bloomberg is the "CEO" mayor ([397]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [398]NancyK, [399]Renie57, [400]Captain C

   and as such, is an even better argument against businessmen running
   government.

   Bloomberg has all the attributes of his class: arrogance,
   imperiousness, and the certainty that he knows what's best for
   everybody. He thinks you're too fat, so it's no Big Gulps for you!
   Plus, maybe he'll save a few bucks on Medicaid.

   Bloomberg is fundamentally at odds with the democratic process. He
   prefers to rule by edict. Hence, we have his bizarre insistence on a
   no-cellphones-in-school policy against the pleading of parents who
   wanted their kids to be able to call home in case of any emergency --
   9/11 hasn't been forgotten. Why would Bloomberg stubbornly insist on
   blowing off these parents' concerns? Because they had the nerve to
   question his authority.

   His time as mayor of NY has many examples of his insistence on
   unpopular projects and laws and his petulance when he doesn't get his
   way. One of them was the ridiculous rip-off West Side stadium that was
   basically a boondoggle for his real estate pals. Of course it was
   always open season on any public union outside police and firefighters.

   Bloomberg as CEO is used to snapping his fingers and saying, "Make it
   so!" And if that doesn't get him what he wants, he'll buy it -- like an
   illegal third term. He's an arrogant prick who actually thought he
   could make a run at the presidency. Bloomberg, along with Romney and
   Bush Jr, are the best object lessons in why government should never be
   run like a business.

   what might not be working in order to make the process a better one. I
   guess it depends on what the parties are trying to accomplish. If
   Bloomberg is only concerned about his ability to fire teachers then the
   process is already broken. Of course every evaluation plan in the state
   already has a major flaw in it. There are still mandates to use
   standardized test scores to evaluate, teachers, principals and schools.

   Both the Administrators and the union members in my district agreed
   that using state mandated test scores as part of a number grade for
   teachers and principals is inappropriate, but for now we don't have a
   choice in the matter. In our agreement we tried to protect those
   teachers who will be subjected to the state generated numbers (4th -
   8th grade language arts and math teachers). I won't try to explain
   specifically how that was done.
