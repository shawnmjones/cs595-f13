True the Vote's True Agenda

   [43]Abby Rapoport

   October 15, 2012

   The organization obsessed with voter fraud may sell itself as
   nonpartisan, but its Republican leanings are easy to spot.

   This is the second and final part of our series on True the Vote.
   [50]Check out our earlier piece on just how effective the group
   will--or won't--be on election day.

   In 2010, before most reporters had heard of True the Vote, the group
   put out a video introducing itself. As epic battle music plays,
   far-right activist David Horowitz comes on screen. "The voting system
   is under attack now," he says. "Movements that are focused on voter
   fraud, on the integrity of elections are crucial. This is a war."
   Horowitz goes on to claim: "A Democratic party consultant once told me
   that Republicans have to win by at least 3 percent to win any
   elections." Catherine Engelbrecht, the group's founder, recounts that
   True the Vote poll watchers went out and "saw corruption everywhere."

   "The left has been focused on this now for decades," says Horowitz, as
   photographs of black voters lining up to cast ballots flash by.
   "Obama's very connected to ACORN, which is a voter-fraud machine. ACORN
   is the radical army." True the Vote is important, the captions say,
   because "The corruption cannot continue."

   As the video illustrates, True the Vote unites a clear, conservative
   bent with a general message of paranoia: The elections are corrupt,
   especially in the nonwhite parts of town--and that's why Democrats are
   winning. The group has become one of the most controversial to take the
   national stage this election; many voting-rights advocates and
   Democrats accuse them of using poll watching, as well as their push to
   purge voting rolls, as voter-intimidation efforts. The group has touted
   a goal of training and mobilizing one million poll watchers around the
   country this election.

   True the Vote insists it has no partisan interests and no racial bias;
   it's simply trying to ensure election integrity. But that is hard to
   square with its rhetoric and actions.

   True the Vote began in Harris County, Texas (home of Houston), as a
   project of the local King Street Patriots, one of the thousands of Tea
   Party groups that cropped up around the country in 2009. The King
   Street Patriots' (KSP) formation, like that of its many counterparts,
   seemed to be a direct response to the election of the nation's first
   black president. Engelbrecht herself doesn't quite put it that way.
   After years of being apolitical, "something clicked" in 2008, she told
   The New York Times.

   By 2010, True the Vote--still an offshoot of the King Street
   Patriots--had become a visible force in the Harris County elections.
   King Street Patriots was registered as a 501(c)(4) with the IRS,
   meaning it could do some political lobbying but could not focus on
   partisan activities. But joint events between True the Vote and the
   King Street Patriots often featured Republican candidates speaking to
   Tea Party enthusiasts. Their Democratic counterparts said they did not
   get invitations. At these gatherings, True the Vote's logo was often
   superimposed over the logo for the King Street Patriots. The group
   became infamous in nonwhite communities for training white poll
   watchers who showed up in minority precincts on Election Day, and soon
   faced accusations of intimidation. Additionally, the group has faced
   criticism and legal action for its Republican ties.

   Texans for Public Justice, a state good-government group, filed a
   complaint alleging that True the Vote trainings served as in-kind
   donations to the state GOP. According to the complaint, the group's
   poll-watching guide referred readers to the Harris County Republican
   Party's website and told poll watchers to send their Election Day notes
   to Brian Bishop of the Harris County Ballot Security Committee, who
   worked for the county GOP. The state Democratic Party soon brought suit
   and, earlier this year, a judge ruled that based on its partisan
   activities, the King Street Patriots could not be a nonprofit
   corporation and was instead an unregistered political action committee.

   To hear proponents talk about True the Vote, though, it sounds like a
   reformist group, outside the influence of partisan fights. The group is
   now a fully separate entity from the King Street Patriots; it has
   registered with the IRS as a 501(c)(3), which gives it nonprofit status
   and precludes any partisan activity (according to the group's website,
   the designation is still pending). When asked how important the group's
   nonpartisan status is, Brock Akers, an attorney for the group, wrote:
   "We regard it as important enough that we have sent letters offering
   our services to the heads of both parties in 17 states. That ought to
   speak for itself."

   But the GOP edge remains easy to spot. In 2011, at the Tea Party
   Patriots American Policy Summit in Phoenix, Arizona, Engelbrecht took
   questions after her presentation. When asked about outreach to younger
   voters, she explained, "We are reaching out to schools, we're reaching
   out to young Republicans, to any number of organizations." Later, the
   group teamed up with Judicial Watch, a multi-issue hard-right group, to
   sue states that weren't doing enough to purge voters from voter rolls.
   Judicial Watch is famous for its president's remarks about "Obama's
   food-stamp army" and complaints that welfare offices allow for voter
   registration.

   Then there was last Wednesday's bombshell. The website Facing South
   discovered that in August, True the Vote [52]donated $5,000 to the
   Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), a political organization
   focused on electing GOP candidates at the state level. As Facing South
   notes, the contribution is not necessarily illegal--so long as the
   donation isn't used for a prohibited activity. But there's no doubt
   that contributing to the RSLC is supporting a partisan group with clear
   partisan goals. The check is also a hefty one for the organization; in
   2011, True the Vote only raised a total of $137,000.


   In addition to True the Vote itself, there are numerous state-level
   organizations that call themselves "empowered" by True the Vote; these
   groups, out of the public eye, are sometimes more overt in their
   partisan sympathies. The groups are not legally affiliated with True
   the Vote, and a few have opted to get a 501(c)(4) status with the IRS
   to allow more latitude in political advocacy. Others have sought the
   same, stricter 501(c)(3) status that True the Vote is currently
   requesting from the IRS. Still others aren't registered with the IRS at
   all. The groups vary in how overtly they discuss partisanship.

   One such state-level group is the Virginia Voters Alliance, which makes
   presentations to Tea Party groups around the state. It's hard to know
   the group's tax status; leader Reagan George declined to be interviewed
   and the group's site does not say whether it is a nonprofit, even on
   its donation page. But the group's political objectives are clear
   enough. In one YouTube video from late April of this year, George
   stands in front a slide titled "Strategy for Winning Elections" while
   giving a presentation to the conservative Shenandoah Area Working
   Group.

   IFRAME: [53]http://www.youtube.com/embed/j_vEZN_sqMY

   "The Virginia Voters Alliance is a leg of a three-legged stool," he
   explains, gesturing to the image of a labeled stool behind him. The top
   is labeled "Constitutionally Conservative Candidates." The two other
   legs, he says, are the Republican precinct organizations and grassroots
   Tea Party groups. "We want to try to get away from three or four
   conservatives running against one RINO." (For those who haven't been
   hanging around Tea Party chatrooms, "RINO" stands for "Republican In
   Name Only.") He explained that the Virginia Voters Alliance would have
   a targeted poll-watching program in "problem precincts," and that they
   would work with the Republican Lawyers Association to address legal
   challenges.

   George focuses heavily on getting Republicans elected. "Poll-watcher
   training is done by the party in effect," he says in the video. "You're
   there representing the Republican Party as a poll watcher." He also
   spends much of the 45-minute presentation telling the audience that
   voter fraud is a widespread problem that benefits cheating liberals.
   "The Republican Party pretty much abandoned precinct organization and
   poll watching back in the '90s," he says. "One of the things we've
   talked about is how to get back into that mode."

   His sympathies are shared by others; the Missouri Precinct Project, an
   "empowered" group that isn't registered with the IRS, describes its
   mission on Facebook as "a grassroots effort to activate concerned
   citizens ... in order to impact the election process by getting
   conservative candidates elected to public office." Other groups are
   less overt. Verify the Vote Arizona produced an infomercial-style
   video, in which one of the leaders specifically notes that being a poll
   watcher "is a partisan position" and names both Democratic and
   Republican parties. But whatever these state-level groups do--and
   whatever lines they cross--need not concern True the Vote. By
   maintaining formally separate organizations, True the Vote has
   effectively created a legal buffer from these groups, despite their
   joint work.


   Along with charges of being partisan, True the Vote has also been
   accused of overt racism. The group seems to target its appeals to white
   voters who feel that advocates for people of color have gone too far.
   White victimhood is a consistent theme in their rhetoric. When he came
   to a group meeting in 2010, Horowitz warned the audience: "They hate
   you. They think you're a racist because you're a Republican."

   True the Vote's introductory video became famous not only for showing
   pictures of black voters as it discussed voter fraud, but also for
   featuring an altered photograph of an African-American woman holding up
   a sign: "I only got to vote once." [54]The original photograph said
   "Don't mess with my vote." That initial slide has since been removed,
   and some of the captions were changed. Even the edited version of video
   has become hard to find now on the internet.

   But it's not just rhetoric: True the Vote has been accused of targeting
   nonwhite voters in its activities. Before the 2010 poll-watching
   controversy, the group targeted a voter-registration drive in Houstin,
   which has an estimated 600,000 eligible voters who are not registered.
   Houston Votes, a paid registration canvass, aimed to sign up 100,000
   new voters in 2010, focusing on nonwhite communities where turnout is
   low.

   Harris County is changing, and changing fast. In the 2000 Census,
   whites made up 42 percent of the county; by 2010, they had dipped to
   less than a third. African Americans make up 19 percent of the
   population while Latinos make up 41 percent. Based on voting trends,
   Harris County should be reliably Democratic--but it's not. Registration
   drives to mobilize nonwhite voters would likely begin to turn the
   county blue.

   Alleging that Houston Votes was part of ACORN, True the Vote worked
   with the Harris County Tax Assessor's office to allege that the
   registration drive was evidence of widespread voter fraud. The
   Republican tax assessor held a press conference, based on the evidence
   True the Vote gathered, that drew tremendous attention from state press
   as he alleged there was "widespread voter fraud."

   One key piece of evidence that's been repeated against and again by
   True the Vote leaders is the story of a vacant lot where multiple
   voters were registered. True the Vote considered it a smoking gun.
   However, according to Doug Ray, the senior deputy attorney in the
   Harris County Attorney's Office, the vacant lot had been a subdivided
   house until the owner sold it and everything was knocked down. "It's
   not an example of voter fraud, " Ray says. "It's just an example of how
   mobile the population of Houston is."

   The voter-registration drive has become part of True the Vote lore. In
   his talk, Virginia Voters Alliance leader Reagan George references the
   vacant-lot story. A leader of Verify the Vote Arizona goes further in
   the group's video, saying Houston Votes tried to registered 100,000
   people in one month. After Engelbrecht requested the new registrations,
   he says "it was found that 70,000 [of the registrations] were
   questionable. In other words, there was a 70 percent error rate."

   But according to Fred Lewis, the leader of Houston Votes, the group had
   only submitted 29,000 voter-registration applications when True the
   Vote began to complain; 80 percent were accepted. Lewis said that after
   the True the Vote claims, the registration drive's funding largely
   dried up and volunteers quit. "Houston Votes was viciously and falsely
   attacked for alleged `voter fraud' to impede our voter registration of
   lower income and minority citizens and to scare up Tea Party poll
   watchers for minority areas," he wrote in an e-mail.

   Engelbrecht herself has accused Houston Votes of being part of the New
   Black Panther Party. At a True the Vote meeting, she played a clip of a
   black man on Fox News arguing that "We have to exterminate white
   people." Engelbrecht then showed a photograph of the Houston Votes
   office, proclaiming, "This is the New Black Panthers office." Fred
   Lewis, who is white, later filed a defamation suit that's still
   pending.

   Whites aren't in danger of any extermination in Harris County, but they
   will make up an increasingly smaller share of the population.
   Engelbrecht herself seemed to allude to that dynamic as she promoted
   her group. "If we lose Houston, we lose Texas," she said at a Tea Party
   rally in the Houston suburbs 2010. "And if we lose Texas, we lose the
   nation."

   When the group began targeting nonwhite precincts in Houston in 2010,
   it seemed to confirm the idea that this group was primarily concerned
   about black voters. Complaints of voter intimidation were high around
   the county, with a total of 56.

   In an e-mail, True the Vote attorney Akers denied all allegations of
   voter intimidation and of targeting certain neighborhoods. He also said
   the group is explicitly nonpartisan. "It continues to be a mystery to
   us," he wrote, "that any credible person would quote from and make use
   of raw, unsubstantiated allegations as though it was an established
   fact."

   But the group does little to fight allegations of racism. In 2010, when
   I asked True the Vote attorney Kelly Shackelford about the allegations,
   he brushed them off. "A lot of districts who've never had poll
   watchers, then poll watchers show up for the first time and they're a
   different color than them and they just don't like that," he said.
   Instead, he explained, the real issue was intimidation of the poll
   watchers by the voters.

   When I asked Akers about outreach to nonwhite communities, he
   responded: "If invited to speak to a group in a `nonwhite neighborhood'
   about these issues, we would be pleased to attend and offer our
   services as we have for everyone else."


   In 2011, Engelbrecht took the stage at the Tea Party Patriots American
   Policy Summit in Phoenix, Arizona, where she began her presentation, as
   she usually does, with the origin story of True the Vote. In 2009, she
   said, "We wanted to do something--we weren't quite sure what--but we
   wanted to do something," she explained. When they heard there was a
   need for poll watchers, several people decided to give it shot. Pausing
   dramatically, Engelbrecht arrived at the big reveal: "When we went to
   volunteer at the polls we saw problems, we saw big problems. We saw
   people who would come in and say `I don't know who to vote for,' and
   then the election judge would say, `I can help you with that.' And then
   they'd escort them over to the voting booth and before you know it,
   that poor voter had had their vote effectively stolen right out from
   underneath them."

   Engelbrecht herself has not poll watched in Harris County. She can't;
   she lives in Fort Bend County, and Texas only allows poll watching
   where you live. But the story she told was the same one an unidentified
   woman tells in the group's 2010 video. That woman also alleges the
   judge voted for the voter.

   Hitting a climax, Engelbrecht looked out to the crowd pleadingly. "Once
   you see something like that you can't forget it," she said. "You
   certainly can't abide it. If you do nothing and you're no better than
   an accessory to the crime.

   "We stepped back and said we're gonna bygum true the vote!"

   Later in her presentation, however, Engelbrecht got serious. "Be
   prepared," she said. "Because you will be vilified. We have been called
   the largest voter suppression effort ever in the history of the country
   by the Huffington Post."

   The crowd cheered at that remark, as she said ruefully, "in some
   circles that would not be an applause line." Lucky for her, she's found
   a circle where it is.

   It could be worse than you think. The pretextual "hunt for voter fraud"
   goes beyond registration purging and poll watchers. In states where
   poll watchers are more heavily regulated, True the Vote and their
   affiliates/allies are recruiting and training people to be actual
   election judges. One organizer went so far as to say "Being an election
   judge is even better than being a poll watcher as you are actually
   running the election."

   So do you think that driver's license makes your vote safe?

   Any liquor store clerk knows how easy it is to get a fake. Do we expect
   TTV not to be aware of this fact in their training? Does the state
   provide adequate guidance for election judges in determining whether an
   ID's picture sufficiently matches the person staning before them? What
   about the signature matching requirements?

   These subjective judgment calls concerning a person's right to vote a
   regular ballot may end up in the hands of someone trained to be
   paranoid rather than reasonably vigilant. See
   http://www.ragingwisdom.com/who-watches-the-poll-watchers-part-ii/ for
   some of the flaws in Ohio's laws protecting voters on election day, and
   here
   http://www.ragingwisdom.com/who-watches-the-poll-watchers-part-iii/ for
   Florida which has a horrific defect in its voter challenge law that is
   not getting enough attention.
