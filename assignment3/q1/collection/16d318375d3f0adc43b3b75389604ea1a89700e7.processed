   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   Today's Helpful Hint

   I may not have a Ph.D. from Trump University (I lied when I said I did
   earlier this week, but that was due to an excessive buildup of radon,
   carbon monoxide, lead, cadmium, arsenic and cat hair messing with my
   brain in my writing closet), but I can say with reasonable certainty
   that if you're running for public office, or doing anything else like,
   say, breathing, you shouldn't do [29]what this Sabattus, Maine doofus
   did:
   Moose crossing sign
   Bonus helpful hint:
   Always brake for moose.

     David Marsters, 68, who is running for selectman, says he told
     Secret Service agents who questioned him Tuesday that he was not
     threatening the president when he posted the [Facebook] message at
     8:17 p.m. Friday. It appeared above a picture of Obama and a link to
     a story about how some Republican lawmakers think the president
     deserves to be impeached.

     The message said, "Shoot the ..." and included a racial slur.

     "I think it's a lot of hogwash," Marsters said in a telephone
     interview Tuesday. "I did not threaten the president. ... I might
     have used the wrong words. ... I didn't say I was going to do it."

     He said his post was taken out of context.

     "What I really meant to say is, 'When are we going to get rid of
     this (expletive),'" he said. "I should have said, 'I hope the
     bastard dies.'"

   If you do find yourself in this situation, however, just follow these
   simple steps: 1) Take a deep breath 2) Delete the Facebook post and 3)
   [30]Ask our governor for a job.

   P.S. In fairness, this should not reflect poorly on Maine as Mr.
   Marster is a transplant from the deep south. Better known up here as
   Massachusetts.

   Cheers and Jeers starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!]

   Cheers and Jeers for Thursday, August 29, 2013

   Your Thursday Molly Ivins Moment:
   Molly ivins publicity photo &nbsp;--- small

     Speaking of freedom, at a public campaign rally in New Mexico at
     which Dick Cheney spoke, those who wished to attend were asked to
     first sign a public loyalty oath, to wit: "I, (full name), do herby
     (sic) endorse George W. Bush for re-election of the United States."
     The form also announced, "In signing the above endorsement you are
     consenting to use and release your name by Bush-Cheney as an
     endorser of President Bush."

     Meanwhile, at Bush's "Ask President Bush" events being staged around
     the country, only Bush supporters are allowed in. This results in
     such tough questions as, "This is the very first time that I have
     felt God was in the White House." Did any of us sign up for this
     four years ago?

   Puppy Pic of the Day:  [34]Before/After  Amazing!

   CHEERS to taking your spatula and going home.  Those supposedly
   "isolated" fast-food-worker strikes that have been breaking out
   sporadically are about to get super sized.  Dovetailing on momentum
   from yesterday's commemoration of the 1963 March for Jobs and Freedom,
   workers in a minimum of 50 cities are expected to walk off the job
   today to get management's attention.  At issue is...
   McCapitalism poster

     ...the fight for $15 an hour and the right to form a union without
     retaliation or unfair labor practices continuing to grow.

     Workers are expected to strike at the nation's major national
     fast-food restaurants, including McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's
     and KFC.  Clergy, elected officials, members of the Congressional
     Progressive Caucus (in conjunction with Progressive Congress), and
     community supporters will join fast-food workers on the strike lines
     in cities from Seattle to Tampa.

   Cities include Boston, Chicago, Denver, Hartford, Houston, Los Angeles,
   Memphis, New York, Oakland, Raleigh and Tampa.  As a former burger
   flipper under the golden arches (and the fastest Quarter Pounder
   dresser in New England, according to me), I think [35]what they're
   doing is great.  Namely, preventing Americans from eating fast food for
   an entire day.

   CHEERS to a fine day for a family reunion.  True fact: when America
   sets its mind to commemorating something, we don't mess around.  That
   was certainly true yesterday for the 50th anniversary of
   you-know-who-junior's you-know-what speech.  (Check out the [36]Obama
   Diary post here for pics and video)  President Obama's speech (standing
   on the "MLK Dreamt Here" plaque) was great, but for my money Jimmy
   Carter, sporting Joe Cool shades, delivered quite the barnburner and
   got a little pissed off at all the right people...

   But Bill Clinton delivered my favorite line:

     -
     "A great democracy doesn't make it harder to vote than buy an
     assault weapon."
     -

   It was tremendous, the whole thing.  Now, in the interest of equal
   time, I'll show you all the highlights from the third anniversary of
   Glenn Beck's August 28, 2010 "Protecting Honor" rally.  What?  You
   missed them?  You must've blinked.
   President George W. Bush joins Arizona Senator John McCain in a small
   celebration of McCain's 69th birthday Monday, Aug. 29, 2005, after the
   President's arrival at Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix.
   8/29/05--moments before
   Michael Brown jumped
   out of McCain's cake
   -
   JEERS to Republican leadership inaction.  Eight years ago today, as
   George Bush displayed a lovely birthday cake he'd baked for John McCain
   (who turns 77 today), a swirling [38]category-3 fetus was terrorizing
   abortion clinics in New Orleans.  FEMA head Michael Brown, drawing on
   his vast experience in disaster management as former head of the
   Arabian Horse Association's legal department, responded [39]swiftly and
   maturely:

     On August 29, the day of the storm, Brown exchanged e-mails about
     his attire with [FEMA's deputy director of public affairs Cindy]
     Taylor, [Rep. Charlie] Melancon said.  She told him, "You look
     fabulous," and Brown replied, "I got it at Nordstroms. ... Are you
     proud of me?"  An hour later, Brown added: "If you'll look at my
     lovely FEMA attire, you'll really vomit.  I am a fashion god."

   Say it with me, for old time's sake: "Heckuva job, Brownie."
   Meanwhile, you want to see something pretty?  Look, Ma, no hurricanes:
   Atlantic Hurricane Center map for August 28, 2013
   Thanks, Obama!!!

   JEERS to overextending your tentacles.  One word: [40]wow:
   Eye looking thru keyhole
   "There's nothing going
   on here...which must
   mean there's SOMETHING
   GOING ON HERE!!!"

     The New York Police Department has secretly labeled entire mosques
     as terrorist organizations, a designation that allows police to use
     informants to record sermons and spy on imams, often without
     specific evidence of criminal wrongdoing.

     Designating an entire mosque as a terrorism enterprise means that
     anyone who attends prayer services there is a potential subject of
     an investigation and fair game for surveillance.

   The story goes on to say that "the NYPD investigated countless innocent
   New York Muslims and put information about them in secret police
   files," and yet----wait for it---"the NYPD has never criminally charged
   a mosque or Islamic organization with operating as a terrorism
   enterprise."  No, but I'm thinking maybe someone should be doing that
   to some people in the NYPD.

   JEERS to flappin' yer gums.  Fifty-six years ago today, South Carolina
   "Dixiecrat" Senator Strom Thurmond ended his over-24-hour
   filibuster---yeah, a real, honest-to-god talkfest---against the Civil
   Rights Act of 1957.  The good news: the bill passed anyway and
   Eisenhower signed it.  The bad news: Thurmond got his voice back.

   -

   Five years ago in C&J: August 29, 2008---Democratic National Convention
   wrapup...
   Ted Kennedy at the DNC cnvention
   Ted in Denver.
   CHEERS to stark contrast.  During the 2004 Democratic convention, it
   seemed like our party's slogan was, "Let's Keep Our Powder Dry."  This
   year it seemed to be, "You May Fire When Ready, Gridley!"  Michelle was
   perfect.  Ted was perfect.  Hillary was perfect.  Bill was perfect.
   Joe was perfect.  Obama was perfect.  The [41]unity bounce was sweet.
   The whole thing was a platter of GOP-smashing red meat with a basket of
   progressive-idea fries and a side of Americana pie.  It was
   Rope-A-Dope.  It was a colossal fake-out.  And the best the wounded,
   shell-shocked Republicans could do was criticize the Greek-style
   columns.  (Then again, when your party is made up of white, calcified
   stonefaces that advocate ancient ideas, I guess I can't blame 'em for
   taking umbrage.)  Good pageant, kids.  You should take it on the road.

   -

   And just one more...

   CHEERS to famous firsts.  Where does the time go, huh?  Five years ago
   today, I posted my first-ever reference to Sarah Palin:

     JEERS to adults who prove every day they're not smarter than a
     fifth-grader.  Steve Doocy of---you guess it---Fox News says Sarah
     Palin is a fantastic choice for vice president.  He thinks she's got
     the chops she needs to handle foreign affairs because [42]Russia is
     in her back yard.  Which I guess means that if McCain wins, Steve
     Doocy will be a shoo-in to be appointed Ambassador to Pluto.

   Tomatoes
   I really don't want to post photos of
   Sarah Palin in C&J. Instead, please
   enjoy some vine-ripened tomatoes.
   -
   I thought Doocy's comment was an isolated bit of garden-variety
   dumbassery.  But soon after, the entire Republican machine went into
   hypergear and backed the idea that Palin was a national security expert
   because she could---in the soon-to-be-immortal words of Tina Fey---"see
   Russia from my house."  It was all downhill from that low, low starting
   place.  Palin has since gotten crushed in a national election, resigned
   as governor because "only dead fish go with the flow," had two
   forgettable books ghost-written for her, gotten hired and fired and
   hired again (and at some point in the future fired again, we presume)
   at Fox News, embarked on (and abandoned) bus tours, and spent the 2012
   Republican convention on the outside looking in.

   Now there are calls from the likes of [43]Bill Kristol to recruit her
   for a Senate run against Mark Begich.  Like that'll happen.  She's more
   likely to end up on QVC hawking powdered moose antler velvet as an
   aphrodisiac.  It's a dream.  She'll make it happen.  Unless she quits.
    Again.

   Oh, and the Syria conflict ended last night in a groundswell of
   compassion, compromise and respect for human rights.  Then my alarm
   clock went off.  Have a nice Thursday!  Floor's open...What are you
   cheering and jeering about today?

     Today's Shameless C&J Testimonial:

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [61]Civil
   Rights, [62]Community, [63]Congress, [64]Culture, [65]Economy,
   [66]Education, [67]Elections, [68]Energy, [69]Environment, [70]Health
   Care, [71]International, [72]Labor, [73]Law, [74]Media, [75]Meta,
   [76]National Security, [77]Science, [78]Transportation, or [79]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([80]California, [81]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Cheers to foster kittens:
       [f5fk.jpg]
       The little monsters won't hold still now so it's impossible to get
       clear pictures.  They are wobbly but in far better shape than the
       last bunch.  Three boys and three girls.  The white one is a head
       rubber and all of em seem to have the "roll on my back and pet my
       tummy" gene.
       Jeers to slow the slow procurement process.  At our department
       level, they can order 500 PCs from Dell and get delivery within two
       weeks.  Several years back, we at our level could do the same thing
       but now we've got some "reseller" layer that adds no value but
       makes the delivery process take months.  I'm trying to schedule
       file server/domain controller upgrades and can't do that until I
       know when the damn things are slated to be delivered.  And our
       "reseller" can't give us an answer.  Why our agency went this route
       when our oppressors at the department level didn't is mysterious.
       Cheers to old train ads:
       [0brb.jpg]
       This is one of the ads on the "hallway" of our Pullman car.  I love
       the "first post-war vacation".  Note the African-American porter.
       Here's some interesting things I learned on that subject while on
       this trip:
       1) The vast majority of Pullman porters "back in the day" were both
       African-American and Fillipino-American.  Pullman porter jobs were
       one of the few job opportunities for either group that offered them
       an entre into the "middle class".
       2) Pullman conductors where white, however...until this year.
       Pullman Railway Journeys hired and trained the first
       African-American conductor this year.  He was the conductor on our
       train.  Wonderful to talk to, loved the job, great at the job.
       3) Back in the 80s, the current director of Pullman (not associated
       back then since Pullman had long since gone out of bidness) met
       with some retired Pullman porters, all African-American.  They
       talked about the backlash they felt within their own community
       "back in the day" for taking jobs with Pullman.  But as one of them
       put it, "I put three kids thru college, the first in any of my
       extended family to attend college and I was able to do that because
       of my job with Pullman."
       4) The current incarnation of Pullman offers full benefits for all
       its employees.  They want motivated, long-term employees, not a
       disposable work force.
       "I'm not writing to make conservatives happy. I want them to hate
       my opinions. I'm not interested in debating them. I want to stop
       them." - Steve Gilliard

   Add my fair city to a site for 1 of the McDonald's protests today;
   drove right by it on my way to work!

   Jeers to being out - of - body tired.

   Bittersweet Cheers to road - tripping this weekend. Mom called me the
   other night & wants me to go through some of my Grandma's things. So, I
   will be doing that Sunday.

   Cheers to Southern Comfort Lime - one of nature's most perfect foods!

   Cheers & Jeers to my first night of teaching my class this semester; it
   could be downright entertaining. See aforementioned Jeer.

   Cheers to Keith Olbermann having fun - or at least sounding like he's

       I fast-forward through some of the interviews, but his narration of
       game highlights (and lowlights) is hysterical.  I never saw him
       when he was on ESPN years ago, so it's cool to see him in his
       element.

   I was quite impressed by President Obama's speech and always love

   I love Gwen Ifill. And as much as he makes me so angry with some of his
   shortsighted and wrongheaded views and policies (war on drugs, wall st.
   worship, domestic spying and remote-control killing to name a few) - I
   love watching interviews with our POTUS. I love the combination of
   sincerity and careful consideration he brings to those interactions. I
   might not always like the content, but I almost always appreciate the
   tone.

   That said - the content of what he said about the civil rights movement
   and the march on Washington really touched me and reminded me of
   something I love about our POTUS. He believes in the power of people to
   make change. A beautiful kind of patriotism. Not the kind of
   backslapping, we are the best, you're either for us or against us,
   "bring it on" sentiment W. confused with patriotism - but a love for,
   and faith in the American people and our collective drive to make a
   more perfect union.

     "That day captures something that is special about this place. And
     that is capacity for ordinary people - for citizens - to change
     structures of oppression that have been in place for decades, and to
     do it peacefully. It not only gives you a sense of the power of
     individuals, but it also says something about the power of America
     to transform itself and we're all beneficiaries of it."

   Maybe just maybe our foremothers and our forefathers came to this land
   in different ships. But we're all in the same boat now. - John Lewis

       Horslips opened for them.
       Honestly, I wanted to leave after Horslips, and so did my date but
       we didn't communicate that to each other until after Styx was
       finished.
       They'd finish a song and stand, arms folded & tapping their feet
       until they felt the audience cheered loud enough and long enough. I
       hated them from that night on and still can't bear to listen to a
       Styx song.
       Horslips rocked the house in their ethnic Irish rockin n rollin
       way. It was their "Book of Invasions" tour, perhaps their greatest
       album and still one of my short list desert island choices.
       To this day, I refer to Styx as "Stynx".

       ... that have black heads and necks and brown bodies are Canadian
       Geese.  There may well be Emperor geese above them swimming (can't
       see them clearly), but the first ones on the shore with the black
       heads, necks, and brown bodies are Canadian Geese.
       The farm where I lived as a child and young adult was in the
       migratory path of Canadian Geese, so we watched them fly both north
       and south every year.  Noisy things when they fly fairly close to
       the ground.

   Yesterday, the man who has been a dear friend for longer than I want to
   admit married the love of his life.  After 32 years of being together,
   these two men who have been grandparents to my son since he was born
   drove to Washington DC to put a ring on it.  I was honored to go along
   as their witness, and everywhere we went in the District Court, from
   the cafeteria where we cooled our heels waiting for their turn at the
   chapel, to the receptionist to the judge, everyone who saw their
   matching boutonnieres and learned how long they'd been together almost
   melted from emotion.  The judge had tears in her eyes as they laughed
   through the ceremony.  They mixed up the rings, got tongue tied,
   laughed some more.

   It was a big hunk of awwwesomeness.  And then we walked down to the
   Mall and listened to the speeches, along with the thousands and
   thousands who couldn't manage the security choke-point.  Couldn't see
   much from the Washington monument, but we could hear.

   who are driving the mayor out of office.

   A local gas/convenience mart, Wawa, wants to build on the site of a
   decrepit shopping center.  People identifying themselves as 'old
   Newark' (old, yes) are staking their yards with signs against it.  This
   might be expected.  But one old bird has had a sandwich board made, and
   he follows Mayor Funk around town, sitting in meetings and staring at
   him, generally being scary.

   It would be bad enough if the Mayor didn't have a history of
   devastating strokes, but he does, and his health is declining quickly
   from the stress. He's resigning as of the 30th of September after a
   series of terms that have done nothing but improve Newark.  And selling
   his house.  That town deserves whatever it gets as a successor.

   Jeers to turning into an old sourpuss.

     [1748]Earlier this week, we told you about the Yamanote Line train
     that will be decked out with the characters from JoJo's Bizarre
     Adventure All-Star Battle (coming to PS3 on August 29). At the time,
     we could only provide you with a few artist renditions of what the
     train might look like. But now, may we proudly present to you 31
     photos of the actual JoJo train, inside and out!

     On August 26 at 5:57am, the first Yamanote Line train of the day
     pulled out of Osaki Station. This wasn't the ordinary lime
     green-striped train that thousands of commuters have come to know,
     this one was special. The exterior, interior, monitors, and even the
     advertisements hanging from the carriage ceiling were covered in
     JoJo. On each side of the doors, the very same characters from the
     manga were proudly displayed for all to see.

       There wasn't much to rot.  I tilled in a good bit of aged chicken
       manure as well as a little 10-10-10, and the weeds just loved it.
       The tomato plants grew well too, just didn't produce many tomatos.

       Pinch and remove the suckers that develop in the crotch joints.
       They don't bear fruit and sap the growing power of the rest of the
       plant.  Make sure they get as much sun as possible, too.  You might
       just have them in the wrong spot.

   lives hanging out in libraries so I can be born a genius and just get
   smarter and smarter.  Hey, I dream big!  :-)

   CH/Jeers?  Ratzafratz.  The heart med I started on made me feel
   exhausted and weak waaaaaay beyond tolerable "side effects," not to
   mention the icky metallic taste.  Ugh.  I quit taking it a couple of
   days ago and by last night I was feeling reasonably chipper.  Yesterday
   I got a new med (should have started then, waited until this morning;
   dosage is half a pill every 12 hours).  I read the list of side effects
   and hope the darn things don't have any of them.  I suspect I'd
   probably do better without these meds with the looooong lists of
   potential side effects.  I'll likely know within 24 hours whether or
   not my system will tolerate them.  I have an EKG on Friday.

   I'll muddle through, but I'm feeling very much like a lab rat about now
   with trying that, now trying this.... Siiiiigh.

     Military response to alleged Syria chemical attack may be delayed
     until Tuesday as Obama warns Syria of 'international consequences'
     ~~~~~
     Obama, referring to the chemical attacks in a PBS television
     interview on Wednesday, said: "We have concluded that the Syrian
     government in fact carried these out."
     ~~~~~
     Furthermore, Washington made it clear it saw no need to wait for a
     report by UN inspectors currently in Damascus investigating the gas
     attack, estimated to have killed more than 1,000 people.
     ~~~~~
     Syria warned of "grave consequences" if US-led military action goes
     ahead. Bashar al-Jaafari, Syria's ambassador to the UN, told
     reporters outside the security council in New York on Wednesday that
     the effect could be felt across the Middle East. "We should keep in
     mind what happened in Iraq and Libya", the envoy said, adding that
     the toppling of Libya's Muammar Gaddafi by Nato-backed rebels in
     2011 had "spread terrorists all over Africa".

     Jaafari urged the US, UK and France to back off and allow UN weapons
     inspectors to complete their investigation into last week's chemical
     attack outside Damascus. The sole purpose of the threat of
     airstrikes was "undermining the inspection team."

       Different people react differently to meds, so going back and
       saying "This is NOT working out well for me, what are the other
       options?" is essential.
       And yes, the real question is do you really need meds at all --
       also worth asking. A follow-up question for the doc is "What would
       have to happen before you'd be comfortable taking me off the meds?"
       Hope you're feeling better soon --

       Yes, I do ask about what's necessary.  I have several medical
       issues, so I also ask my pharmacist about drug interactions (they
       run it through their computer program, too), and, as noted below, I
       spend my Saturday evening refilling pill minders.
       This particular medical issue the cardiologist is trying to
       regulate is atrial fibrillation (fluttering, galloping heartbeat
       episodes, and it's kinda scary to wake up from a sound sleep with
       this - it could lead to a heart attack) and the different meds are
       to try to control it, on top of the left bundle branch block (which
       is painless and no medication to solve the issue, which may
       eventually lead to a myocardial infarction) and I found out about
       that several years ago when I checked into ER with weird symptoms
       and was diagnosed with high blood pressure.  Assorted relatives
       have/had AF.  My aunt had a pacemaker for hers.  My brother has had
       a surgical process called ablation on his heart earlier this year
       (and no recurrence of his AF!  Yay!).

       ... whatever program that runs videos needs an auto update.  I've
       been having problems with jerky videos for a couple of weeks, so I
       pause them while the dim part of the bottom line goes forward
       enough, then restart them and they run okay.
       I wondered if the Perseid Meteor Shower or Sun Spots were messing
       things up a couple of weeks ago when it was pretty bad and no
       electrical storms were visible on the weather maps.
       Electrical storms mess up the wireless connection between the ISPs
       dohickey (the little console with four green lights when things are
       working properly) that leads to my wireless router for the bars
       that's what's happening (at least according to the graph diagram
       that diagnoses problems) because from the router to my laptop the
       connection is fine.  I don't know why.  It just does, and it starts
       when storms are almost to the next state west of me a couple of
       hundred miles away.  I can fight it and go keep disconnecting and
       reconnecting the one cord that plugs into the router and get my
       bars back..., or I can turn it off.  [Of course, if/when the
       electrical storms do a power outage, as they have on occasion, then
       I really get pissed!]
       S'okay sfbob.  I luv you!  Hope your phone changes its mind soon

   Take me out to the ball game.  Fun night spent at AAA ball game
   (Pawsox) last night, they won!  Hotdogs, pretzels, cracker jacks and
   peanuts.  Oh, wait, did I mention beer?  AND beer!
   As the dog days of August draw to a close....hey, wait a
   minute!....where's my name in among the August birthday guys/gals you
   want to do lunch with?  Huh? Huh?  It was a wonderful time this year,
   thank you, but a tadlet rainy (no kidding, it poured!!!!), but the
   lobsters (who were the guests of honor at the birthday feast) didn't
   seem to mind the rain....it was the bubbling pot on the stove they
   worried about!
   Happy August to everyone, have I mentioned how much I love August?  I
   do.  I really, really do!
   Have a wonderful day, and if you're starting your long labor day
   weekend early....Happy Labor Day!

   My favorite in Philadelphia sits in the University City neighborhood;
   Clark Park.  There is a year-round farmers market on the fringe, a
   field in a bowl which is used for everything from kids' soccer to
   ultimate frisbee, and the world's only lifesize statue of [2653]Charles
   Dickens.  The park sits at a confluence of cultures, with yuppie
   families, college students, hippies, old-school neighbors and
   immigrants.  The vibe is always relaxed and friendly.  This Saturday,
   head over for [2654]Philadelphia Pagan Pride Day.  A good time is bound
   to be had by all.

   backing up same sex marriage after public input. It looks like Taos

   It seems that New Mexico is the only state that never defined marriage

       It's based on the Vespa. It's fun to drive and you get 48 decades
       per gallon. I topped off the tank after scoring lunch with Jerry at
       the Haight, circa 1968.

   their forks for that matter.

   The first caller I hear asked why can't Congress work together for a
   program that benefits everyone. He's claiming that the Canadian health
   care system doesn't offer access to older Canadians; that the GOP
   wanted to negotiate, but the ACA was rammed through at midnight without
   input from "the other side;" it's not the chaos that it appears. No one
   knows what's in the 3000 pages of legislation.

   Poll question: which is the most important:

   1. job creation
   2. simply tax code
   3. immigration reform
   4. "tackling" debt
   5. ACA, aka "Obamacare"

   Results:

   1. 7%
   2. 7%
   3. 6%
   4. 18%
   5. 48%

   Roy from Centerville wants energy independence. Kelly offers a
   pro-fracking argument. Access to fresh water Great Lakes, arable land,
   and timber. Alt energy can wait for the future. If he were POTUS, he'd
   recognize the most hard working people in the world to grow the
   economy. Pro-Keystone Pipeline.

   Franklin from Erie: Obama inherited tough economy, GOP blocks
   infrastructure improvements that historically both parties favor. GOP
   blocks everything. Are they waiting for 2016?

   Economy is still bad. $1 trillion was squandered. <10% on
   infrastructure, more money spent on other programs by Obama. Kelly
   wanted five year transport plan instead of two. Too much red tape. Erie
   airport was result of bi-partisan work going back decades. Government
   meddling and overregulation.

   Well, it looks like Kelly's not going to embarrass himself too much.
   I'm out.

   I'm living in America, and in America you're on your own. America's not
   a country. It's just a business.

   Jeers to the continued saga of the crushed disks. My arm is killing me
   today.
   Cheers to posting about my arm on book of face yesterdiddy as follows,
   in its entirety:
   "I know it's attached to my body, but sometimes it feels like a foreign
   object."
   Cheers to my female friends for their giggles and to my sister for
   tentatively setting them straight, while allowing the possibility they
   might have the right idea after all as you never know for sure with me.
   Cheers to over 30 years together and almost 30 years of marriage to my
   wife. No special reason. I just feel it more and am conscious of it
   today.
   Cheers to Jimmy Carter. I don't think there has ever been such a class
   act in the role of former POTUS.
   Cheers to our furrier, 4-legged friends, yours and mine. Since I've
   been sleeping in the recliner every night for the last few weeks, my
   old boy Dylan has stretched out next to me on his fleece-covered foam
   pad. And he has been kind enough to keep the breathing end closest to
   mine and his gas emissions to a minimum.
   Cheers to you all, cuz, goddammit, you deserve it!
   Cheers to our gracious host BiPM for maintaining the arbor and kiddie
   pool where we meet and to all whom he loves and who love him back.

   Just a quickie, as I must dash to run errands before the rampaging
   hordes of "Final Weekend Of Summer" Folk arrive.

   Cheers to Bill and his beloved and all da kids.

   Cheers to Molly Ivins.....what a lunch that would be!!  She barely
   edged out the boys, Bill and Barry, but she did!

   Cheers to adorable puppies and kittens, which is redundant,
   'cause...........look, squirrel!!  :-)

   Cheers to fast food workers.  I don't eat at those places that often,
   although, more often than I should.  They deserve a living wage.  It's
   not like when we were kids in HS and lived at home; these workers are
   trying to support families!  Give 'em enough to do so.  So sorry,
   shareholders....suck it up.

   Cheers to all of us who love and are loved. Nothing else compares.

   For the same reason I voted for Molly--this week keeps resurfacing the
   crazy. I need an extra day off and some laughs in the background. Or
   foreground. Or something.

   Cheers to inching my way through the "to-do" list. I like those days
   better than the ones that land me more to-dos at the end of thet day.

   Cheers to Don Rumsfeld, being cautious on the war front. 13 years late,
   but he's here.

   Cheers to kids and books. Just got the request to read to kids at a
   local school on their annual reading buddy day. The kids have atypical
   development for various reasons, so they don't all pay much attention,
   but they do so very enthusiastically, so it's a blast to read to them.
   I'll be late that day.
