   Extras: An enormous "THANK YOU" to all my friends who drove over 3
   hours to be there for this project and partied their faces off all
   night to create some really beautiful moments... despite the fact it
   was a Tuesday night and most of you have grown up jobs/school! I can't
   thank you enough...
   Some very special behind-the-scenes people I could not have done this
   project without, my dear friends and family:
   Chris Ricchetti: for being my rock and believing in my music and
   message long before anyone else did (except for Mom and Dad...haha)
   My best friend and brother Bill, my sister Katie, and Mom and Dad
   John Dentzman and family for the use of their beautiful Pontiac\
   Steve Tomala: I can't believe we got that piano out of our basement...
   never ended up using the burning piano shots for this video, but one
   day they will see the light of day. Enldess thanks to you
   Thank you to Mr. Murphy and his family for graciously allowing me to
   use his yard for the music performance scenes!

   July 2, 2013
   I fought with who I was for most of my life. In every way a young
   person can fight with himself.
   But starting today, I'm laying it out there. I'm done playing it safe.
   I'm fortunate to have smart friends who believe in me, but I don't have
   a manager or a label or any sort of funding other than the money I make
   playing piano downtown at The Joynt, and also, ironically to some, in
   the churches on Sunday morning.
   As far as the ascetic achievements of the video... lets just say I was
   lucky to have a good friend introduce me to the best team I could have
   asked for... who held on to the roller coaster that was this project
   and dealt with all my intensity and craziness as the true professionals
   they are.
   I wrote the song during a drunken piano jam session at a party. I
   recorded the vocals in my parents' basement and worked with my friend
   Max Steger to record and mix the rest of the instruments.
   I feel like most music industry people wouldn't like the idea of me
   "pigeonholing" myself by telling this story as I have. But I don't
   believe the world sees change until it sees honesty.
   So I went in on my own.
   I went all in. I'm nervous/excited/horrified/anxious about the effect
   that all of the choices I am making (and have made throughout my
   journey of discovering myself as a man and as an artist) will have on
   my future. But then I remind myself that I never really had a choice.
   This is the story I've been aching to tell my most of my life... the
   universal story of longing to be loved...it is what I hold dearest to
   me.
   BUT my story would never have seen the light of day were it not for the
   people I have listed above, many of whom asked for nothing in return. I
   know my passion and intensity for this project were a lot to deal with
   (that might be the understatement of the year.. ;)) Thank you for doing
   your best to help me keep my sanity... just barely. And thank you for
   sticking with me; for your flexibility and patience and for helping to
   bring my vision to life. And to mom and dad... I know you guys don't
   always understand just what the hell I am trying to do, but continue to
   love and support me nonetheless. It means everything to me...
   -Steve
