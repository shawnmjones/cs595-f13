Gov. Snyder meets with Dems from Congress

   Governor Snyder's signing pen can also veto.

   Michigan Governor Rick Snyder is meeting this morning with the state's
   Democratic congressional caucus, as the Democrats try to head off
   Republicans' seemingly unstoppable push to pass anti-union legislation
   in the state this week. [3]From the Detroit News:

     When asked what he hoped the meeting would accomplish, [Congressman
     John] Conyers smiled, threw up his hands in a "who knows" gesture
     and hurried into the meeting.

   [4]The Detroit News says Governor Snyder will also have a chat with
   President Obama on the tarmac in Detroit today. Obama has come out
   against the anti-union bill.

   Before Governor Snyder announced [5]his new support for a so-called
   Right to Work law last week, the idea of banning union shops was just a
   gleam in Republican lawmakers' eyes. Now Snyder has joined in calling
   Right to Work a matter of basic freedom for workers -- though,
   interestingly, the legislation exempts police and firefighters unions.
   [6]Republicans say they're fine with leaving those unions strong (and
   presumably those workers with less freedom) because they're not as
   active on behalf of Democrats as other unions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   As he has argued for the law he used to insist Michigan did not need,
   Governor Snyder says the "i[7]ssue is on the table whether I want it to
   be there or not." It is true that as Michigan governors go, [8]Snyder
   has vetoed relatively little legislation. On the other hand, Snyder has
   shown himself willing to stand in the way of legislation he does not
   like, even when the bills reflect cherished agenda items for his party.
   In June, Snyder [9]quietly disappeared a restriction on abortion
   rights. He also stood up for creating an insurance exchange in his
   state to comply with health reform. The next month, [10]he vetoed a
   package of bills designed to make it harder to vote and to register
   voters, preventing Republicans in Michigan from getting those in place
   before the 2012 election.

   Whether Michigan Democrats and labor activists can remind Governor
   Snyder that [11]he does have the power of the veto -- and that he will
   own the Right to Work bill that now threatens to divide the state -- is
   today's big open question.

   UPDATE on the Snyder's meeting with the congressional
   delegation, [12]from the Detroit News:

     "The governor said he would strongly consider our request," Carl
     Levin said. "We sincerely hope he takes it to heart."

     Levin explained that by law no one is required to join a union, but
     it's an issue of fairness for nonunion members to pay for the
     benefits that unions negotiate on their behalf.

     "Unions must represent everyone in a work place, whether they are
     members or not," Levin said. "The question is: Does everyone pay
     their fair share whether or not they are a member of a union?"

   Governor Snyder considers the meeting private, so we don't have his
   side of it yet.

   Unfortunately, after the failed effort to recall Walker, this was
   almost inevitable. It was shown that there would almost certainly be no
   political fallout form the move, you get to break teacher's unions once
   and for all and what votes do you really lose that aren't
   counterbalanced by weakening the political machine of your opposition?

   Similar governors of somewhat similar states (Blue-leaning nationally,
   but very much Red locally) following the same steps to enacting similar
   legislation. Namely, saying they aren't going to pursue something and
   then, curiously, making it the very first thing they do after an
   election, with no chance to oppose, much less debate the bill. It was
   clearly a move scripted far in advance, as there were ads all over TV
   for the "Freedom to Work" initiative the same day the story broke run
   by the "Freedom for Michigan" PAC.

   This is the danger of electing what I call "Reasonable Republicans".
   They are, after all, still Republicans.

   The other part of this law, that I've heard about, should REALLY send
   Michigan voters over the edge.

   In Ohio, you had the situation where the voters of the state could
   override the law. From what I've read, the Republicans are writing a
   provision into the law that prevents the voters from being able to do
   this.

   Talk about taxation without representation.

   What's next? The state taking over local communities and throwing out
   the elected officials and running the community themselves? Oops.
   They've already done that.

   The Michigan Constitution makes it so bills with appropriations cannot
   be subject to repeal. This was written with the intent that it was for
   fiscal related bills. Republicans have been using this exemption to
   pass many unpopular laws and making them repeal proof. The RTW bill
   from what I've read will have an appropriation of $1 million dollars,
   probably for 'informational' purposes.

   The $1 million appropriations part of the bill is for "administrative"
   purposes, whether they actually do any "administration" and use the
   funds, appears to be irrelevant.

   my wife belongs to the uaw, at their union meeting last month the
   international rep that was there told my wife to shut up and sit down,
   she told him he needed to shut up listen to them, it will be nice that
   very soon she will be able to fire him, the unions do not care about
   the members, they only care about the money that the members pay, they
   are criminals that use violence and intimidation to keep the members
   and others in line, i am sure she will love giving this p.o.s. his pink

   Note to the editor: RTW doesn't ban union shops. Union shops (and
   closed shops) have been illegal nationwide since the 1947 Taft-Hartley
   Act.

   RTW bans agency shops. In other words it requires unions to grieve for
   and defend non-payers, while those non-payers do not have to compensate
   the union for the expense. That's how it destroys unions.

   A recent article (11:50am) in the Detroit Free Press states:

   "A couple of hours after meeting with the [Democat party] delegation,
   Snyder signaled his continuing support of the right-to-work bills when
   he tweeted, 'Freedom to work is all about creating more and better jobs
   in Michigan.'"

   Michigan's unemployment rate went up recently, even though business
   taxes have pretty much been eliminated, taxes on sr. citizens have been
   raised, education spending has been slashed, and revenue sharing with
   cities has been severely contracted. Where's the jobs Governor?

   Snyder is either extremely ignorant or he's ignoring more than half of
   the voters in Michigan. Probably a combination of both. He's no "tough
   nerd" as he persistently said throughout his 2010 campaign. He's just
   another truth-challenged republican seeking vengeance. We'll see how it
   all rolls out in 2014 when a large number of these folks are up for
   re-election.

   Post from my son: The state police at the capitol today appear to have
   a new addition to their crowd control tool belt. Looks like a 3 foot
   long billy club and about half of them have one attached to their
   belts. Also, found out this morning that they are closing off the
   streets around the capitol tomorrow, including the streets with the
   parking garages on them. So not only are they keeping people's voices
   out of the building they are trying to keep them out of town as well!
   Last week I was somewhat ok with the police presence here because at
   the very minimum this is a very historic building and it needs to stay
   free from wear and tear which large crowds can often cause, but now I
   am feeling a little more like a criminal while I am doing my job
   because I oppose this legislation that they are forcing through. These
   police are even telling me which set of stairs I can and can't use
   while giving me the evil eye as I walk through the halls.

   They are really UP on how to deter free speech now a days , especially
   if it is a gop in office , I have not seen a FREE SPEECH ZONE in some
   time now

   You can bet the cops have the tow trucks ready to go , since they have
   limited parking now , so they can also impound every ones cars , WE THE
   PEOPLE need to take back our democracy , THE RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE & FREE
   SPEECH is in The Constitution , while the word CAPITALISM is not

   Trying to send a openly coded message:

   The Constitution is valid until it is invalid. By definition a
   constitution cannot be self-eliminating, so a fundamental challenge by
   the Supreme Court would only refer back to the amendment process. Since
   as stated in the Constitution the Senate makes its own rules, then it
   must have been designed by a class of men called 'honorable'. We can
   then come to know, once again, that having a long lived series of
   honorable men is not as reliable as it might have once seemed. A recent
   retired Justice said that the Constitution would mean little if it were
   not based on 'trust'. So should seem to some contemporary to this age
   that 'trust' has been lost by some combination circumstances, that also
   should be clearly identified so that they can be addressed squarely.
   Why the public should be concerned that the elements of the
   Constitution can be turned one against the next to create uncertainty,
   and then to take advantage of the created uncertainty to obtain a gain
   of some type. The forces of evil would be certain to undermine that
   'trust' and have worked diligently to ruin a nation of ... we 'trust'.

   Even the earliest versions of the Constitution have had a storied
   history of needing hastily created amendments, the tenth amendment in
   particular has in modern interpretations been taken to mean that
   individual States Executive Power can be enhanced while the history of
   technical progress has so interconnected the commerce and economy that
   it is obvious that it would be more efficient and less of drag on the
   economy to implement federal regulation. It is true the interconnected
   commerce, transportation, travel and communications have enabled the
   private sector to build corporations spread nationwide and globally.

   This commercial success once applied to wring maximum profits then,
   bring upon itself the expectation of the same or similar profit from
   some future investment scheme. It is clear enough that the first
   attempt at national integration of business would come at the cost of
   requests for federal level legal enablements. Those same federal
   enablements would become an impediment when the nationalized facilities
   where located across the country, and all the states were to consider
   state regulations. Thus to continue to profit those same corporations
   would cease needing federal help, and resort to laws from fifty state
   houses, to further the profit line of some interminable scheme. The
   states could reduce regulations, lower wages, eliminate benefit and
   work assiduously against the lowly wage workers ability to bargain for
   better conditions.

   So what does this bring, except so called State competition to keep
   profits high? As will be the case, as soon an all the locations of all
   the business will have reduced wages, and profits at maximum. But after
   all that can be wrung out the federal and states, then it is only the
   local regulations that become the next obstacle. Below that would
   regulations conditions and a product that is failing, and then, as if
   you didn't know the business with inflated books is sold to your
   grandfather pension fund. Those pension funds would become the subject
   of failure and again become a ward of the federal government. Who then
   is the proper recipient of the blame for this hellish predicament?

   Of course I wish I didn't have to remind all that the technological
   miracles when applied against the simpleminded concept of honorable men
   have consequences. Those technical innovations have enabled so called
   business interest to form lobbying groups, who attack federal, state
   and local regulations. When the rules of the Senate that have been
   subverted to the purpose of a huge encircling scheme to make profit
   without honest business risk, invest and developed interests then it is
   time to consider the Constitution invalid, waiting not one minute
   longer, for the branches of government to conclude that it is
   unconstitutional to represent the people within the nation.

   Many a legal scholar has pointed out that the Constitution only grants
   protection to individuals and through many legal cases does not grant
   those rights to groups, unions, political parties, or moneyed
   revolutionaries. Apparently the right to assembly means only to stand
   peaceably until you drop dead. Yet the Courts constantly find ways to
   support assembled groups as such as corporations, purchased charity
   groups, lobbyist and so called civic groups to be oddly dedicated to
   only themselves, and the neglect the very individual mentioned so often
   as the sole beneficiary of the Constructions protections.

   The wolves in the forest are not groups of citizens seeking protection
   from the Constitution that they own, but are the very threat that is
   seeking group protection from a system that was not designed that in
   that way at all. The modern corruption that the Constitution has become
   would have supported King George III, over the patriots, patriots so
   naïve in law that the infamous words "We the People ..." are not parts
   of that Constitution. The rules of the Senate have become the extra
   Constitutional exception that could be jiggered to eliminate a
   Constitution that could otherwise not eliminate itself.

   If a new revolution needs to started then lite the fire here: Resolved
   there shall be no group that is formed or funded any corporations,
   wealthy individual or purposed civic organization that cannot be
   recognized to represent individual petitioners citizens that can lobby
   Congress persons. Any Congress person to accept support from any group
   will be removed from Congress and cannot be replaced until the next
   biannual or hex annual election, those citizens who elected that
   Congress person will be without representation, until that election. A
   second offense punished by permanent imprisonment and the loss of all
   assets, current of in the future.

   So they are only against supposed DEMOCRATIC PARTY unions ? I would say
   they just exposed themselves as biased political hacks , and passing
   legislation that reflects just that , I would think there would be a
   way to expose these people over this in the next election ...

   Can you imagine a dem in office saying they are exempting dems from the
   legislation they are passing , because they just want hurt gop voters
   real bad ?

   This is what pass's as GOVERNING for conservatives ? they are hate
   filled and dysfunctional

   I'm for Making Michigan a Right to Join a Union State. My company of 23
   years does not have a union, and I wish to join a union and have a
   union represent me as an individual, in wage, benefit and workplace
   safety negotiations. If the argument passes that a worker should have
   the right not to join a union even though the union was certifed at
   his/her place of employment, then it follows, naturally, that a worker
   should have the right to join a union even if one was not elected for
   his/her place of employment.

   This all fits into the current repub/libertarian mindset. All money
   belongs to the rich, and the rest of the society is left to fend for
   themselves. Of course, they never see the logical end of their
   "philosophy". They want to destroy anything they consider "socialist".
   In otehr words, get rid of "socialist" trappings such as
   taxpayer-supported education---kids go to private school if their
   parents can afford it, or go to religious schools supported by state
   money. We need to get the taxpayer out of other "socialist"
   organizations like the police and fire departments. Why should the rich
   pay taxes to support groups that mostly deal with the poor? Let police
   and fire protection be on a subscription basis. If you don't pay for
   police protection, 911 won't take care of you. If your house catches
   fire, the fire department won't even respond if you haven't paid your
   subscription. By such methods, anyone less than affluent will be
   subject to the harsh rules of social darwinism. The poor will be the
   cheap labor needed for various functions that enrich the rich or make
   their lives more comfortable. They will lead short, brutal lives and
   die in middle age, much like Victorian England. We all remember those
   joyful days...workhouses, rampant disease and poverty, Jack the Ripper.
   Yep, that's the society the good ol' USA needs!
