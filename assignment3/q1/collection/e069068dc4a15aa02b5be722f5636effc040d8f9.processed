   A fan review who say the show last night. Oh myyy! Do you have your
   tickets? www.allegiancemusical.com/tickets
   I saw Allegiance tonight at the Old Globe, and I just wanted to say
   this immediately: YOU MUST SEE THIS PLAY!!! I have only said this once
   before in my 30+ years of theater-going in San Diego, and that was for
   Jersey Boys. When word-of-mouth hits the streets, it will sell out
   every show...do...not...hesitate! This play is a stunning achievement,
   moving, funny, heartbreaking, and inspiring! The music is fabulous, the
   acting is off the charts.
