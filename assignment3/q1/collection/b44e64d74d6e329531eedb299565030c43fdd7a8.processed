Researchers: Jamestown settlers resorted to cannibalism

   By Elizabeth Landau, CNN
   updated 6:21 PM EDT, Thu May 2, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Remains of 14-year-old girl "Jane" found from 17th century
     * Researchers say she was cannibalized, based on forensic analysis
     * This supports the accounts that historians have that cannibalism
       was used for survival

   (CNN) -- The winter of 1609 to 1610 was treacherous for early American
   settlers. Some 240 of the 300 colonists at Jamestown, in Virginia, died
   during this period, called the "Starving Time," when they were under
   siege and had no way to get food.

   Desperate times led to desperate measures. New evidence suggests that
   includes eating the flesh of fellow colonists who had already died.

   Archaeologists revealed Wednesday their analysis of 17th century
   skeletal remains suggesting that settlers practiced cannibalism to
   survive.

   Researchers unearthed an incomplete human skull and tibia (shin bone)
   in 2012 that contain several features suggesting that this particular
   person had been cannibalized. The remains come from a 14-year-old girl
   of English origin, whom historians are calling "Jane."
   Archaeologists from the Smithsonian Institution and the Jamestown
   Rediscovery Project announced evidence of survival cannibalism during
   the winter of 1609-10 in historic Jamestown, Virginia. The findings
   answer long-standing questions about the occurrence of such a practice.

   Scholar: Settlers ate each other
   Studying the history of cannibalism
   Cannibalism in colonial America?

   There are about half a dozen accounts that mention cannibalistic
   behaviors at that time, although the record is limited, said Douglas
   Owsley, division head of physical anthropology at the Smithsonian
   National Museum of National History.

   The newly analyzed remains support these accounts, providing the first
   forensic evidence of cannibalism in the American colonies.

   What we know from the bones

   Jane's remains were found in a 17th-century trash deposit at the former
   site of James Fort. William Kelso, chief archaeologist at the Jamestown
   Rediscovery Project said at a briefing Wednesday that the fort was
   built in 1607, but has been washed away. Kelso and colleagues began
   digging in 1994 and have been excavating the site on Jamestown Island
   ever since.

   Owsley and colleagues can tell quite a bit about what happened to Jane
   when at least one starving settler in the fort apparently tried to feed
   off of her.
   If it's any consolation, it appears that she was already dead at the
   time.

   Researchers say it looks like someone had tried, but failed to open the
   skull with four shallow chops to the forehead.

   The back of the skull contains markings that could have been made by a
   small hatchet or cleaver striking it. The cranium cracked open from the
   last hit. Forensic experts say it appears the person striking the skull
   was right-handed.

   The skull's mandible contains cuts all over it and inside, which
   experts say reflect an attempt to take tissue off of the face and
   throat with a tool such as a knife. The cheek area reflects a "sawing
   action" of a tool going back and forth, Owsley said. There are also
   sharp passages of a knife.

   At some point in the process, the head was removed, Owsley said.

   The damage done to these remains indicates that whoever inflicted it
   was not a skilled butcher, he said.

   "Instead, what we see is hesitancy, trial, tentativeness and an
   absolute total lack of experience."

   The shin bone that archaeologists recovered also appeared to have been
   chopped, but in a way that more resembles classic butchering
   techniques, Owsley said.

   "The person doing this was clearly interested in, based on what would
   have been accepted cuisine in the 17th century, in cheek meat, muscles
   of the face -- that area -- and tongue, and also in terms of 17th
   century traditional cuts, would also include the brain," he said.

   It is possible that more than one person was involved in this, given
   the disparity in butchering practices seen in the head compared to the
   shin bone.

   What we know about the colonists

   In the summer of 1609, the settlers experienced two significant
   setbacks, said James Horn, vice president of research and historical
   interpretation at Colonial Williamsburg.

   The first was that a large fleet bringing supplies and settlers to
   Virginia was scattered. It had been carrying 500 settlers from Plymouth
   along with provisions.

   "The fleet represented a new beginning for Jamestown, which had
   struggled over the previous two years," Horn said.

   A hurricane scattered the ships a week before they were supposed to
   arrive. The flagship with the leaders of this pack ended up in Bermuda.
   Shakespeare's play "The Tempest" takes its inspiration from this event.

   Six ships reached Jamestown in August 1609, with spoiled or depleted
   food, and many settlers in poor health. "On one of those ships was
   Jane," Horn said.

   At the same time, the relationship between the Jamestown colonists and
   the native Powhatan Indians had broken down. The existing settlers were
   already experiencing disease and a shortage of food, and the demands
   they made on the Powhatans strained their relations.

   That was the environment into which 300 additional settlers arrived at
   the James Fort.

   One of the leaders of the group, [41]Captain John Smith -- the same one
   who was famously friends with [42]Pocahontas -- returned to England in
   October 1609 because he was injured, Owsley said, leaving a leadership
   vacuum.

   In the fall, the Powhatans waged war against these colonists, and
   launched a siege against the fort.

   With no way to get food from the outside, the colonists resorted to
   eating horses, dogs, cats, rats, mice and snakes, Horn said, according
   to the accounts of George Percy, who was the president of Jamestown
   during this time. There are even accounts of people eating their shoes
   and any other leather that could be found. Anyone who left to try to
   scrounge for roots in the woods was killed by the Powhatans.

   Percy wrote, according to the Smithsonian, "thatt notheinge was Spared
   to mainteyne Lyfe and to doe those things which seame incredible, as to
   digge upp deade corpes outt of graves and to eate them. And some have
   Licked upp the Bloode which hathe fallen from their weake fellowes." In
   other words, cannibalism.

   It's not clear how many deceased colonists were cannibalized. Only 60
   of 300 of the original colonists survived, described as "looking like
   skeletons," Horn said.

   In May of 1610, the settlers finally arrived who had been shipwrecked
   in Bermuda, effectively saving the colony. Lord Delaware brought even
   more colonists and enough provisions to last a year.

   There are still more pits at the fort to be excavated, and only 10% of
   Jane's body has been recovered, Owsley said.

   "I think there's going to be other examples," Owsley said. "Whether
   that will be found -- with archeology you never know what's going to be
   under the next shovel."

   A special exhibition will begin at the Smithsonian about Jamestown and
   Jane's story on Friday.
