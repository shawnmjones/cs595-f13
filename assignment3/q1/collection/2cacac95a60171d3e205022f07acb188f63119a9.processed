   The billboard appears to suggest that comedian Jerry Seinfeld is the
   star of the show, and that the program may focus on his life in some
   way.

   CHICAGO--City commuters reported a mixture of surprise and excitement
   this weekend after passing a billboard informing them of the existence
   of a situational comedy titled Seinfeld, which evidently stars stand-up
   comedian Jerry Seinfeld.

   According to the billboard, the program, which many commuters speculate
   could be based on the observational comedy of Jerry Seinfeld, would air
   back-to-back episodes on weeknights at 9 and 9:30 p.m.

   "Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian? He has a television program?" asked
   driver Laura Galloway, 49, after first seeing the 14-by-48-foot sign
   that reportedly depicts Seinfeld with a somewhat cocksure facial
   expression that also seems to suggest, "Come on, people." "I would have
   never known that Jerry Seinfeld had his own episodic comedy series had
   I not seen that billboard."

   "I hope the show is a success," she added.

   Commuters told reporters that based on the button-down shirt and
   sweater vest the comedian is wearing in the advertisement, it appears
   as if Seinfeld takes place in the 1990s, and that the program will be
   centered around a Jerry Seinfeld-like character.

   Sources speculated that while it is fairly clear--based on the way
   Seinfeld is crossing his arms--that the show is a comedy program, the
   billboard didn't make it entirely apparent what Seinfeld's occupation
   would be. Various commuters said that his job could be anything from a
   wisecracking attorney, to a newlywed, to a stand-up comedian, or a shop
   owner of some kind.

   Commuters also said it was unclear from the billboard if Jerry
   Seinfeld's name in the television series would be Jerry Seinfeld or if
   the stand-up would have a different first name altogether, like Mark or
   Eric.

   "Now that I know when it's on, I am definitely going to watch the
   show," Mark Posniak, 37, told reporters, adding that this is the first
   time he has ever heard of a television program called Seinfeld. "But
   back-to-back episodes five days a week? That's 10 episodes every five
   days. I just hope he doesn't get burnt out."

   "He looks great though," Posniak said, referring to the image of
   Seinfeld. "It's like he hasn't aged a day. He's got a full head of hair
   and looks full of energy. I guess I would be too if I was just given my
   own television program."

   Sources nationwide confirmed that the Chicago-area billboard is just
   one of many advertisements for the Seinfeld-inspired situational
   comedy. A second version of the advertisement, seen in many cities
   throughout the country, reportedly features Seinfeld pictured with a
   bespectacled, balding man, a dark-haired woman, and a second taller and
   more frazzled-looking man, all of whom are hugging one another, leading
   many to conclude that these individuals are also characters in the show
   and may be part of Jerry Seinfeld's fictional family, the Seinfelds.

   The presumed existence of a cast prompted many onlookers to abandon
   their previously held belief that Seinfeld was actually a talk show
   hosted by Jerry Seinfeld.

   A third sign, which shows a wild-eyed Seinfeld clutching his hair with
   both hands, fueled speculation amongst many drivers that the show's
   comedy would be broad, zany, and feature the Jerry Seinfeld character
   dealing with numerous madcap complications that frazzle him.

   "It seems like there is a lot of marketing for Seinfeld, so I bet a lot
   of people will watch it," Ben Reynolds, 34, told reporters. "Good for
   him, ya know? A guy like that, who's stuck around so long, finally
   getting a show. That's very cool."

   As of press time, commuters in cities throughout the country were also
   scrambling to learn more about another new television program entitled
   King Of Queens, which seems to be about a stocky delivery man and,
   according to numerous billboards, is also adopting the same grueling
   five-night, 10-shows-a-week production schedule.
