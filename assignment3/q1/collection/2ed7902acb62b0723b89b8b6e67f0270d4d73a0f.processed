'Threat' billboard moving

   Brian Francisco | Washington editor

   A tea party-sponsored billboard that says "The Navy SEALs removed one
   threat to America ... the voters must remove the other" has apparently
   moved west on U.S. 30 in Whitley County.

   David Ditton of Whitley County Patriots said Monday that the sign has
   been taken down from near the Allen County-Whitley County line and a
   Steel Dynamics Inc. plant "due to a demand from the property owner."

   Ditton said the billboard was being placed along westbound U.S. 30,
   west of Larwill, on property owned by Perma Advertising Co., which had
   rented the original billboard from Fort Wayne-based Steel Dynamics.

   The Journal Gazette was unable to reach a Steel Dynamics spokeswoman
   for comment.

   The newspaper reported on the billboard in a Sunday story. Ditton was
   quoted as saying the "other" threat to America included President
   Obama, some of his appointments and many members of Congress who scored
   low on ratings by FreedomWorks, a Washington-based, limited-government
   advocacy group.

   The first "threat" in the message was Osama bin Laden, the planner of
   the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City, Washington and
   Pennsylvania. Navy SEALS killed bin Laden on May 1, 2011, at his
   compound in Pakistan.

   Ditton said in an email Monday that Steel Dynamics officials "were
   consulted ahead of time that there would be a political message on the
   board, but they weren't advised what it would say."

   Steel Dynamics asked that the billboard be removed before the story was
   published, Ditton said. Steel Dynamics did not return a call last week
   seeking comment.

   Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney occasionally has
   mentioned Steel Dynamics as being among the companies that Bain Capital
   helped steer to success. Romney led the Boston-based venture capital
   firm in 1994, when it invested more than $18 million in the startup
   steel company.

   Steel Dynamics today employs about 6,300 people.
