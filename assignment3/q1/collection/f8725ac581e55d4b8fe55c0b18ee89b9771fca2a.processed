   Bill Gates speaks with doctors in front of the GeneXpert diagnostic
   system at LRS Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases

   March 24, 2011 | By Bill Gates

Tackling TB Through Innovation

     Bill explores innovation in testing and treating tuberculosis, as he
     spends World TB Day in India.

   Many people think [13]tuberculosis is a disease of the past, but this
   ancient epidemic remains a huge global problem. Each year there are 9
   million new TB cases and 1.7 million deaths.

   Yet there is a tremendous opportunity to turn this situation around.
   Most new TB cases are in major emerging economies like India, China and
   South Africa, which have a remarkable history of using innovation to
   address tough health challenges. They are adopting new TB strategies,
   and are poised to develop the next wave of innovations. This could
   change the way the world fights the epidemic.

   The major problem is outdated tools. TB is preventable and treatable,
   but the most common TB test is more than 125 years old and misses half
   the cases. By the time most TB patients are correctly diagnosed and
   treated, they may have unknowingly infected many others - creating an
   endless cycle.

   At the same time, today's TB drugs are more than 40 years old and take
   six months to work. The combination of poor tests and outdated
   treatments is driving the spread of drug resistance, undercutting
   global efforts to stop the epidemic.

   I witnessed this firsthand in 2009, when I visited the King George V TB
   hospital in Durban, South Africa. I met a woman with HIV who had been
   diagnosed with a highly drug-resistant type of TB. She told us about
   the despair she felt when she learned she had such a dangerous form of
   the disease.

   Fortunately, there is a promising pipeline of new TB diagnostics, drugs
   and vaccines under development. And we are starting to see results.
   Just today, I saw how India is using these innovations. I marked World
   TB Day by visiting the state-of-the-art [14]L.R.S. Institute of
   Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases in New Delhi with Dr. Ashok
   Kumar, head of India's TB program. L.R.S. uses a new molecular test,
   GeneXpert, which can accurately determine whether a patient has TB in
   about two hours.

   Molecular diagnostics could revolutionize TB care, and things will
   continue to improve as the price comes down and new tests are
   developed. This is where India could have global impact. India is a
   leader in developing low-cost health technologies, and the country
   could produce high-quality, inexpensive molecular TB diagnostics. This
   would increase access at home and across the globe.

   Meanwhile, South Africa is stepping up its own efforts. The country
   will likely begin widespread use of GeneXpert soon. This could
   profoundly impact health in a country where thousands of lives are lost
   each year to TB/HIV co-infection.

   India and South Africa's leadership shows the extraordinary potential
   for high-burden countries to pioneer TB innovations. Their success
   could be a model for other countries--and save millions of lives in the
   process.

   Bill Gates 2011 Annual Letter - A Health Emergency
   [25]

   February 17, 2011

Annual Letter: A Health Emergency

   The world's making progress against malaria, neonatal deaths and
   HIV/AIDS, but not enough. In his 2011 letter as co-chair of the Bill &
   Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill explains why he's willing to be viewed
   as a troublemaker by people who are happy with the status quo.

Cell Phone Science

   Cell phones with malaria biosensors are just one way scientists are
   using mobile technology to improve health care in the developing world.

Eliminating Killer Diseases with New Medicines

   Public-private cooperation, Bill says, is saving lives by improving
   access to pneumonia vaccines and combination TB treatments.
