   It's GOTV weekend in Los Angeles! I'm off to go walk a precinct. Enjoy
   the thread!
     * This is a milestone: today [29]marks the 100th anniversary of the
       1913 Woman Suffrage March on Washington.
     * A [30]recent poll in California finds that 61% of voters now
       approve of marriage equality. And the Field Poll is one of the
       state's most reliable.

     Support for same-sex marriage in California has moved beyond 60
     percent, with approval from voters in virtually every category
     growing substantially over the past three years.

     A new Field Poll found that Golden State registered voters favor
     same-sex marriage by 61 percent to 32 percent. Support has grown
     significantly in all age groups and regions of the state and among
     all ethnic groups.
     A majority of Republicans continue to oppose gay marriage, but
     support among the GOP has grown from 26 percent to 39 percent since
     2010.
     "The dynamic that has occurred in the last three years kind of spans
     all populations," said Mark DiCamillo, the poll director. "It's
     almost as if it's a societal change."
       Ayup, that it is. With Republicans on the wrong side of history
       once again.
     * Mitt Romney, [31]still being a dick:

     ROMNEY: We did very well with the majority population, but not with
     minority populations, and that was a failing, that was a real
     mistake.

     CHRIS WALLACE: Why do you think that was?
     ROMNEY: Well, I think the Obamacare attractiveness and feature was
     something we underestimated, particularly among lower incomes. And,
     uh, just didn't do as good a job in connecting with that audience as
     we should have.
       Yeah. No, Mitt, it's the fact that your Republican Party has
       systematically despised black and Latino people for decades But
       yeah, helping make health insurance more affordable might have been
       a contributing factor.
     * Think the labor movement is assault here? We've got [32]nothing on
       Colombia.
     * The current state of the [33]California Republican Party, as
       described by Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee:

     State party conventions are typically about accentuating the
     positive and promising more gains in the future. But this weekend's
     state GOP convention in Sacramento has been about acknowledging the
     party's sad condition - among other things, it's broke and deeply in
     debt - and exploring ways to rebuild itself.

     "I don't think we can get any lower, so the only way is up,"
     Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the House GOP whip, said during an
     appearance Friday before the Sacramento Press Club.
     "Losing has one great benefit to it," GOP guru Karl Rove told
     delegates. "It gives you the chance to start fresh, to look
     everything anew and start rebuilding from the ground up in
     innovative and thoughtful ways that will expand our reach and expand
     our members."
     "Get off your ass," Rove added. "Get back in the game."
       Really hard to do that, though, if the people hate your ideas. Good
       luck!
     * According to a [34]new poll, the race for Mayor of Los Angeles is
       proceeding along the lines that most people are expecting, with
       City Councilman Eric Garcetti and City Controller Wendy Greuel
       poised to advance to a runoff on May 21. That said, the electorate
       is still very volatile. The election is on Tuesday.

   [45]Tagging tips - [46]Search For Tags - [47]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Still giving minorities second class status ([116]0+ / 0-)
       and not even registering the fact. Sure, he "got it right" with the
       "majority" population, because he played to people's baser fears
       and motives, and insulted the best in Americans' biggest tent
       idealism. The longer he and his party don't get how truly generous
       Americans really are, how much they want to see all of us win -
       fairly - together - the longer they will have trouble seeing
       themselves clearly in their own mirrors.
       And the second class status will go to their own place in
       history...

   The LA mayor's race is a good time to remind people that plenty of
   local offices across the country - mayor, city council/commission, and
   so forth - are up for election this year. These local elected officials
   often become our farm team for future state and national office!

   I encourage everyone to consider stepping up and running for local
   office!

   for finally bringing VAWA to the House floor.  While Melissa Harris
   Perry might consider it 'caving', I'm not sure it's really 'caving'
   when you do the right thing, finally.  Seems to me that you 'cave' when
   you do the wrong thing for some reason of expediency.  Doing the right
   thing is simply the right thing.

   One thing I routinely see pundits do, though, is misinterpret the
   pressures on Boehner.  He's in a seriously steady district, ran
   unopposed from the left this last time, and only against unfunded Dem
   protests candidates pretty much his entire career, and has had no
   serious rightward challengers, or even any rumblings of them.  While
   the 'Tea Party' wing might potentially threaten his speakership, there
   has been no threat to his House seat from either the left or the right
   for years, and the one time I remember someone making noise about
   challenging him from the right (Sheriff Jones, one of the local
   anti-immigrant types) the party machinery talked him out of the run.

   Boehner has the latitude to buck the 'Hastert Rule' far more often and
   get away with it, if he so desires.  It's not external pressure that
   prevents him from working more with Dems, it's his own ideology.

       supported VAWA is an act of magnanimity that could help in future
       moments when the same reps might be considering a jump of the fence
       on another tough vote.
       It's how politics works, and needs to work again. You soften up the
       opposition when and where you can, so you might leverage the
       goodwill down the road.
       VAWA is no small accomplishment, and credit is due to ALL who got
       it done, even if it is WAY overdue. We can't change what's
       happened, just mark the scorecard, make the most of the moment,
       look to the best advantage for the next battle, and keep on...

   State lawmaker defends bike tax, says bicycling is not good for the
   environment

   Posted on March 2, 2013 by Tom Fucoloro

   Representative Ed Orcutt (R - Kalama) does not think bicycling is
   environmentally friendly because the activity causes cyclists to have
   "an increased heart rate and respiration."

   This is according to comments he made in an email to a constituent who
   questioned the wisdom of a new bike tax the legislature is considering
   as part of a large transportation package.
   ================

   One neat response was that he logically must favor an exercise tax
   since people not in repose emit more carbon exhausts.

   Don't be so sure that your party has reached its most base level yet,
   Mr. McCarthy.  The Republicans are likely to find a way to be even more
   vile; it seems that they've been digging deeper each year throughout my
   lifetime.

   And what's with the vulgarity?  First Mr. Boehner complains that it's
   time for the Senate and the president to "get off their asses," and now
   Mr. Rove suggests that the Republicans need to "get off their asses."

   Maybe if they tried to comport themselves in ways appropriate for what
   used to be called "polite society," instead of using language
   third-grade bullies use on the school yard, they could come across as
   mature, better than third-rate individuals, and they could display

     ROMNEY: Well, I think the Obamacare attractiveness and feature was
     something we underestimated, particularly among lower incomes. And,
     uh, just didn't do as good a job in connecting with that audience as
     we should have.

     "There are 47 percent who are with [Mr Obama], who are dependent
     upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the
     government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that
     they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to
     you-name-it," Mr Romney said. "And they will vote for this president
     no matter what."

   [367]http://www.telegraph.co.uk/...

     In the 60 Minutes piece, interviewer Scott Pelley pointedly asked
     Romney: "Does the government have a responsibility to provide health
     care to the $50 million Americans who don't have it today?"

     "Well, we do provide care for people who don't have insurance,"
     Romney said. "If someone has a heart attack, they don't sit in their
     apartment and die. We pick them up in an ambulance, and take them to
     the hospital and give them care. And different states have different
     ways of providing for that care."....

     "It's the most expensive way to do it -- in the emergency room,"
     Pelley said.

     "Again, different states have different ways of providing that,"
     Romney replied. "Some provide that care through clinics, some
     provide the care through emergency rooms. In my state we found a
     solution that worked for my state. But I wouldn't take what we did
     in Massachusetts and say to Texas, 'You've got to take the
     Massachusetts model.'"

     Accused Scottish cardinal admits sexual failings

     LONDON (AP) -- A Scottish cardinal on Sunday acknowledged having
     engaged in unspecified sexual misbehavior, apologized for his
     actions, and promised to stay out of the church's public life in a
     statement that comes at an awkward time for the Vatican.

   "Sexual failings" sounds like something you treat with a blue pill.

   Can you imagine if a CEO, President, Congressperson or a member of any
   other profession was accused of being a serial predator of adult males
   that reported to him and later admitted impropriety, that the
   Associated Press would come up with a sympathetic headline like "Former
   teacher admits to sexual failings?"

   Despite setbacks, the Catholic church remains powerful or at least has
   powerful allies, as is evidenced by this kid glove treatment.
