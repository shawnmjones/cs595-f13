   Happy St Patrick's Day, if you're into that sort of thing!
     * [29]Luke's Change: Was the destruction of the death star an inside
       job?
     * One of the 19 children of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar of 19 Kids
       and Counting fame is [30]joining the bigots over at the Family
       Research Council:

     A spokesman for the FRC confirmed that they have met with Josh
     Duggar, the eldest son of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and a father
     of two (with one on the way) himself, about an executive position
     with their lobbying arm, FRC Action.

     "We greatly appreciate Josh and the Duggar family for their devotion
     to the pro-family movement," J.P. Duffy, VP of communications for
     the FRC, told E! News. "This is why we have talked to Josh about the
     position. We have talked to him as well as other candidates but no
     decision has been made."
     Duggar, 25, participated in ProLifeCon, the FRC's annual pro-life
     social-media forum, back in January.
       Not surprising--Josh has probably had to do a whole ton of family
       research just to keep his own siblings' names straight.
     * In China, there is such a thing as [31]unlawful mapping:

     The Coca-Cola Company is in hot water with Chinese authorities over
     allegedly using handheld GPS devices to map parts of southwestern
     Yunnan province, reports The Wall Street Journal. The case is one of
     21 related to illegal surveying in the region. Coke claims no
     wrongdoing, saying it used standard "e-map and location-based
     customer logistics systems" to increase its fuel efficiency and
     provide better customer service, adding that the systems are used
     "across many industries in China and world-wide." The company also
     insists that it is in full compliance with regulations, and noted
     that it is cooperating with the Yunnan government to resolve the
     matter.
     * Remind me not to hike in China with a GPS, I guess?
     * Birther hypocrisy. Case in point: [32]Marco Rubio.

     You see, the U.S. Constitution does indeed leave it wide open when
     it states the following: "No Person except a natural-born Citizen,
     or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of
     this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President..."
     Cruz's defenders are quick to point out that Cruz's mom is an
     American citizen, and even though his dad is Cuban, Cruz is an
     American citizen because his mom is one.

     Does that sound familiar at all? Anyone?
     Time to get those Air Canada tickets for the Cold Case Posse so that
     we as Americans are absolutely sure. I mean, the last thing I would
     want in this country is Canadian Cruz fooling us all in 2016. Next
     thing you know, a President Cruz would enact the Tim Horton Hockey
     Act of 2017, requiring that all young Americans under 12 buy ice
     skates and find their nearest frozen pond. The horror.
     * I keep thinking about the Rob Portman business. I found [33]this to
       be an interesting read.

     Senators basically never have poor kids. That's something members of
     Congress should think about. Especially members of Congress who know
     personally that realizing an issue affects their own children
     changes their thinking.
     * Sarah Palin: [34]making teleprompter jokes...from a teleprompter.
       Oh, and joking about reality shows, after having been on one. Do
       conservatives understand the idea of hypocrisy?
     * [35]This laughable column by George Will is perhaps one of the most
       ridiculous arguments against striking down Proposition 8 that I've
       had the misfortune of reading.

     When a federal judge asked the lawyer defending California's ban
     what harm same-sex marriage would do to the state's interests in
     "the procreation purpose" of heterosexual marriage, the lawyer said,
     "I don't know." This was mistakenly portrayed as a damaging
     admission. Both sides should acknowledge that, so far, no one can
     know.

     A brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court concerning the
     California case by conservative professors Leon Kass and Harvey
     Mansfield and the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy warns
     that "the social and behavioral sciences have a long history of
     being shaped and driven by politics and ideology." And research
     about, for example, the stability of same-sex marriages or
     child-rearing by same-sex couples is "radically inconclusive"
     because these are recent phenomena and they provide a small sample
     from which to conclude that these innovations will be benign.
       So basically...unless we can be absolutely certain there won't be
       detrimental effects, we can't advance equality and social policy.
       If we had followed Will's logic, we wouldn't have interracial
       marriage, or hell--women's suffrage, for that matter. After all,
       it's damn hard to prove a negative.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [46]Tagging tips - [47]Search For Tags - [48]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       I have carefully read all your words on CPAC 2013, all the
       responses, recc'd accordingly; I've admired your brilliant new
       graphics (please credit the artists), and I thank you for such an
       extraordinary effort.
       You have been more than a fly on the wall, in that flies don't have
       swatters and you have a big snappy one that never misses.
       What is always puzzling to me is how easy it would be for the GOP
       to gain insights into its own image -- how they are perceived in
       America -- simply by reading the Daily Kos.
       I hope you are an organ donor, because if that day ever comes when
       your Maker sends you on assignment to that big BLUE sky, I hope
       your corneas are bequeathed to a young mind who will see the world
       through your eyes and express your vision as well as you have. Love
       your work. Again, thanks!
       Sincerely!

   Corned beef and cabbage, with warm honey drizzled pumpernickle bread
   and an "Irish Wake" for brunch at a local Irish bistro.

   Took an hour to get into the place, listening to an insufferable

       the owner were like anal: corned beef and cabbage is not irish.
       they were apoplectic about it. this restaurant was awesome. real
       irish soda bread and colcannon, bread and butter pudding...
       Hell I had to take a whole course on Ireland and Irish cuisine just
       to work there. And Irish geography. PLUS we were taught to say,
       instead of "um", "em"- as in M&M - because that's the way it's
       pronounced in Ireland. the food was amazing and they had a real
       live actual irish band in the place every night AND a dancer doing
       that Irish dance thing. It was great. If my old boss heard you
       mention corned beef and cabbage he'd have your head.
       Oh, and NO CLOVERS or LEPRECHAUNS in the restaurant. Ever.

   FRC is giving an "executive position" to a kid with no college
   education whatsoever and a K-12 education that took place at the dining
   room table with more emphasis on "character" development than academic
   rigor. Add in that his only work experience is half heartedly running
   the car lot his daddy bought for him...

   Seems like someone at FRC is looking for free publicity and to cash in
   on the positive (and thoroughly ignorant) public perception of this
   family that has been created by TLC and other media.

   Earnest young educated conservatives must be throwing up their hands as
   they just found out that in that movement appearances are far more
   important that anything else.

   I can't see much benefit to gas milage on deliveries no alternative

   large. It's a very undeveloped part of China, mostly dirt roads.

   Also the busiest transshipment point for heroin out of Burma's golden

   Rather than either it's more than likely the distrust of foreign

   someone feels a need for a big night out of Karaoke.

 CO Sheriffs Threaten Not To Enforce Gun Laws ([249]4+ / 0-)

     Colorado Sheriffs Threaten Not To Enforce Their Own State's Gun Laws

     For months, local sheriffs have been objecting to federal efforts to
     stem gun violence in the wake of the Newtown massacre, claiming they
     violate "states' rights." Now, with a package of gun violence
     prevention measures awaiting the governor's signature in a state
     that has seen some of the most deadly and high-profile mass
     shootings, several Colorado county sheriffs are threatening not to
     enforce their own state's measures to expand criminal background
     checks and limit ammunition magazines if they are signed into law.
     The Greeley Tribune reports:

        Weld County Sheriff John Cooke said he won't enforce either
     gun-control measure waiting to be signed into law by Gov. John
     Hickenlooper, saying the laws are "unenforceable" and would "give a
     false sense of security." [...]

         "They're feel-good, knee-jerk reactions that are unenforceable,"
     he said.

         Cooke said the bill requiring a $10 background check to legally
     transfer a gun would not keep firearms out of the hands of those who
     use them for violence.

         "Criminals are still going to get their guns," he said.

         Cooke said the other bill would also technically ban all
     magazines because of a provision that outlaws any magazine that can
     be altered. He said all magazines can be altered to a higher
     capacity.

         Cooke said he, like other county sheriffs, "won't bother
     enforcing" the laws because it will be impossible for them to keep
     track of how the requirements are being met by gun owners. He said
     he and other sheriffs are considering a lawsuit against the state to
     block the measures if they are signed into law.

       You "can alter" an apple into an illegal crack pipe, alter conduit
       into an illegal zip gun, alter PVC into an illegal silencer, alter
       common chemicals into illegal explosives, can alter a DVD into
       child pornography, can alter safe food into contaminated food.
       In all those cases, the material is not the issue, it is the
       criminal act of altering a thing into something illegal or
       possessing the illegal thing, not making the "precrime" a criminal
       offense.

   The country isn't facing an immediate debt crisis, House Speaker John
   Boehner (R-Ohio) said Sunday, but he argued that Congress and the
   president must reform entitlements to avert one that lies dead ahead.

   Prepare for the usual - GOP fakes a pass to Obama, agreeing to cut
   Social Security & Medicare for low income seniors, then screws him over
   and leaves Dems owning the cuts.

   Who are the real losers? Low income senior citizens and those who will
   become low income senior citizens in the decades to come.

       actually is. This is all a big game and no, there will be no cuts

   On a tangential, personal note, I have always known that my optometrist
   was conservative and religious, and this fact has bothered me somewhat,
   but not enough to seek services elsewhere.  However, during my last
   visit, he told me that his son did an internship with Focus on the
   Family.  I have since found another optician.

   The state has an interest in procreation? Is it the petitioners'
   contention that the planet or some geopolitical fragment thereof is
   endangered by a lack of humans?

   If that contention can possibly be considered a valid reason to deny
   citizens the personal, social and economic benefits of marriage, why
   would a state permit infertile persons to marry, whatever their gender?
   Why are gentlemen who have had vasectomies issued marriage licenses?

   What, in short, does the ability to push out personal progeny have to
   do with the state's sanction of pair-bonding between informed,

   I would think that a republican in the primaries would challenge his
   eligibility. The way the constitution is written is pretty vague but
   since he was born in Canada he should not be eligible.
   The supreme court really needs to rule if someone born in another
   country to only one American citizen is eligible. The birthers would
   pretty silly if the didn't challenge Cruz.

   which, coming from heterosexuals, is that gay couples should have the
   right to be "as miserable as we are." The thing is that, sarcasm
   notwithstanding, equality in marriage really does include the right to
   make the same sort of mistakes as heterosexual couples do and to be
   assessed for those mistakes on precisely the same basis as heterosexual
   couples are judged.

   The idea that gay couples shouldn't be permitted to marry because our
   marriages might end in divorce, suffer from infidelity or domestic
   violence, or produce children who grow up to be criminals is ludicrous
   since none of these possible outcomes bars the right of heterosexual
   couples to marry.

   you'll find one of two motives--and often both:

   1 - A very deep, profound, irrational, paranoid--almost
   psychotic--infantile and hysterical (even if outwardly often
   suppressed) fear of the "other", as well as of change, reality, and the
   prospect of maybe having been wrong, or coming from a family or
   tradition that maybe was wrong, about some BIG things.

   Like, oh, on slavery, women's rights, gay right's, civil rights,
   economic policy, war, national security, etc.--you know, what's the
   word...EVERYTHING!

   2 - Ego, megalomania, opportunism, self-advancement and greed.

       I also believe that "conservatism" is an extremely easy political

       I watched a brief clip of the doc done by Nancy Pelosi's daughter
       re Mississippi and nothing could be clearer.  One quote was "I

       This also explains why grifters like Palin and Gingrich can
       continue to be relevant.  They simply dust off whatever poutrage du
       jour is making the rounds and toss it out for consumption.  Palin's

     birth in Canada (except where neither parent is a citizen or
     permanent resident and either parent is a representative of a
     foreign government, their employee, or anyone granted diplomatic

   This is based on the 1947 law with amendments which was in effect at
   the time of this birth.  Renouncing Canadian citizenship is "positive

     19 Kids and Counting (formerly 17 Kids and Counting and 18 Kids and
     Counting) is an American reality television show on TLC. The show is
     about the Duggar family, which consists of parents Jim Bob and
     Michelle Duggar and their 19 children--nine girls and ten boys
     (including two sets of fraternal twins), all of whose names begin
     with the letter "J". The series began on September 29, 2008.[1] It
     has had ten seasons, with the latest beginning on August 28, 2012. A
     series of three specials began March 12, 2013, followed by the
     season 11 premiere on April 2

       but she acts as mother to none of them once they're past 6 months
       old.  The youngest might be a slight exception.  What she does is
       hand them off to her older daughters to raise.  The third oldest
       daughter handles the homeschooling which is certainly skirting
       Arkansas law.  None of the kids have so far gone to a brick and
       mortar college and the older daughters will be expected to stay at
       home until they are wed to an appropriately fundamentalist guy.
       The Duggars went to Japan and China last year and the shows that
       were filmed there just show them to be Ugly Americans.  They didn't
       take any time to learn about the countries they would be visiting.
        And they're rude, too, in societies that are very polite.  Ugh!!

   Boris Johnson Tells Theresa May To `Cool Her Porridge'

   London Mayor Boris Johnson today told Conservative Cabinet ministers
   who have been accused of positioning themselves for the post-Cameron
   leadership to "put a sock in it and back the Prime Minister".

   Mr Johnson did not mention by name the ministers he has in mind, but
   his remarks are likely to be seen as a slapdown to Home Secretary
   Theresa May, who last week fuelled speculation about her leadership
   ambitions with a speech which ranged far beyond her policy brief.

   Mrs May is reported to have been the target of Education Secretary
   Michael Gove's private warning to Tory Cabinet ministers earlier this
   week not to undermine David Cameron's position as PM.

   It reminds me of an old joke. "It was recently discovered through new
   letters that have surfaced that Beethoven had actually started an
   unfinished tenth symphony that he had buried with him. But when they
   dug up his grave, they discovered that not only hadn't he composed a
   'new' symphony, he was actually decomposing."

   Conservatism hasn't conserved shit for thirty years.  All it has done
   is dress up a scam for the rich in party clothes of supply side
   economics, trickle down theory or my favorite: compassionate
   conservatism.

   George Will's punditry portrays conservatism quite accurately.
   Extolling its virtues make him a worthless sonuvabitch.  But at least
   he's rational, unlike David Brooks.

   in Alexandria, VA this weekend. One of the sites is the "Lee-Fendall
   House", a revolutionary-era house that belonged to the Lee family, of
   Robert E Lee fame (his father, Harry "Light Horse" Lee and one of
   Washington's top generals, built it). Thing is, being in the south, it
   was built by slaves. But the person narrating this segment, who happens
   to be it executive director, referred to them as "enslaved workers". Is
   this standard practice in historical sites, or was she using a popular
   southern euphemism for slaves to whitewash the matter, a la "The War of
   Northern Aggression" instead of the Civil War?

   I just found it kind of odd, and, frankly, offensive. Am I
   overreacting, or is this yet another example of how some southerners
   are still in denial over slavery?

   Recommended by:

   unions though out history that have not procreated.

   Does that mean that a couple was retroactively never married?  That
   could get legally very hairy if one were deceased or disabled?

   Or does it mean that under the power of the state they would be forced
   to divorce if there is no procreation by some predefined point in their
   marriage?

   Are marriages between older couples who are incapable of procreation
   not really legal marriages?

   I doubt the procreation "requirement" would stand up in court if that
   were brought as the defining legal issue of a suit.

   In any case same sex couples can legally adopt just as married couples
   who cannot procreated can.

   relationship between entertainment and "news" introduced me to the
   Duggars via an early morning show.  After the mother started taking
   drugs to keep having kids I found that a tad bit hypocritical.  But I
   digress.  This story about their oldest kid joining a hate group, FRC,
   makes me wonder how much is that discussion about us.  I mean if the
   Duggars didn't have a popular show made popular by us this wouldn't
   even be a story.

   And the "pro-family movement"?  My goodness!  What a ridiculous phrase.
    It's like "pro-life".  We're all for living (I'm still breathing,
   right?).  We're all for families (Where do you think I came from and am
