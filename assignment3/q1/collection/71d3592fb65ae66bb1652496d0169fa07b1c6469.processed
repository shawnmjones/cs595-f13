[22]Sorry, GOP: You're still losing the sequester blame game

   Goposaur upside down
   Just before sequestration kicked in, [29]most Americans said they
   opposed the looming automatic budget cuts and would give Republicans
   the greatest share of the blame if they ended up taking place. Now, a
   little over two weeks later, the cuts are in effect and, as they
   promised they would, Americans are blaming the GOP.

   In [30]the latest Washington Post/ABC Poll, 39 percent of Americans
   approved the automatic budget cuts while 53 percent opposed it. It's
   not hard to understand why Americans oppose the cuts: 64 percent said
   they thought the cuts would hurt the economy, 60 percent said they
   thought the cuts would hurt the government's ability to provide basic
   services, and 69 percent said they thought the cuts would hurt the
   military.

   Sixty-eight percent of Americans said they wanted President Obama and
   congressional Republicans to continue discussions about how to replace
   the sequester, but in the absence of a deal to do so, Republicans are
   continuing to get more of the blame. Forty-seven percent of Americans
   blamed Republicans exclusively while just 33 percent blamed the
   president. Fourteen percent said both sides deserved the blame. These
   are essentially the same numbers from [31]the previous Washington
   Post/ABC survey when 45 percent blamed Republicans and 32 percent
   blamed the president.

   The survey also showed the President Obama's job approval rating stood
   at 50 percent approve, 46 disapprove. This [32]was reported as a drop
   from his numbers earlier this year, when his approval rating was at 55
   percent, but it's also a better approval rating than he had one year
   ago in the same survey. Then, his rating was underwater with 46 percent
   approving and 50 percent disapproving.

   Meanwhile, Congress as a whole is still wildly unpopular with a 16
   percent approval rating and 80 percent disapproval. Congressional
   Republicans have a 24 percent approval and 72 percent disapproval
   rating and Democrats have a 34 percent approval and 64 percent
   disapproval rating.

   The poll was conducted from March 7-10 and has a margin of error of
   ±3.5 percent.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 No grand bargain ([70]6+ / 0-)

       True enough but the American people don't want cuts to social
       security and Medicare either.  On the other hands, polls have
       consistently shown that cutting the military is acceptable.  Most
       people think we go to war too much and spend too much money on the
       military.  Also, increases in taxes on top 1 percent are
       acceptable.
       What the president can propose, I realize he can't do anything
       without congress, is keep cuts to military in place and close some
       loopholes.  That should allow for some domestic spending to be
       restored.
       So if he can't get an agreement from congress then we'll have to
       live with the sequester.

 No they don't. Sequester fits their aims badly. ([100]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   It protects both Medicare and Social Security, which they'd like to
   cut.  It cuts disproporionately at Defense, which they'd like to
   protect.

   They say they like it, but when push comes to shove, I'll bet the
   rhetoric is little more than that.

       If they do, Republicans win, but...in the long term, so do the rest
       of us.
       Not, of course, from whatever deal gets cut, but by exposing
       Democrats for what they will have turned out to be:
       servants of big money interests, and friends to the middle class
       only when it serves their purpose -- OR -- gutless and ineffective
       politicians incapable of engaging the electorate to bring pressure
       to bear when it's needed.
       Let's hope the folks at the top aren't so allergic to victory that
       they make a determined effort to snatch defeat from its jaws.
       Brave talk aside, GOP really is screwed here.

   I approve of the administrations stance on marriage equality and DOMA.

   I disapprove of the administration's stance on chained CPI, secrecy,
   drones, and ANY negotiation with the GOP in Congress that does not
   begin with "you already lost, you are arguing from weakness". Even if
   that means four years of constant gridlock. I am not prepared to
   exchange the New Deal and Great Society for the spectre of "austerity".

   National data, on "blame" or satisfaction with congress doesn't
   necessarily trickle down to state elections.

   If we want the population of congress to change, the "blame" has to be
   FROM constituents TO the representatives who elect them in regional
   state elections.

   National "blame?" for a general group. I don't think it'll lead to
   change.

       can have their minds quickly changed, once the republicans start

       You are right.  If we cut those two programs spoke will be all over
       Dems and will blame them.
       Here's a way out.  Substitute for cross the board sequester cuts in
       military and increased revenue. With any sort of decent growth that
       will reduce deficit enough.
       Cutting the big three is a bad idea.  Make the republicans propose
       that like they did in Ryan budget.
       The president needs to listen the progressive caucus.  He has shut
       them out for 4 years.  What harm would it do him to meet with the
       progressive caucus a coupe of times?

 The longer sequester goes on ([160]0+ / 0-)
       and the worse things get, the more the blame will shift to the
       President.  Just because it's happening on his watch.  Most of
       "Stagflation" was not Jimmy Carter's fault - it was baked in before
       he ever took office.  Most of the 1990-91 recession was not George
       HW Bush's fault - it was the result of the collapse of the 1980s
       commercial real-estate bubble.  Yet, as those things wore on, the
       presidents were saddled with the blame.
       People tend to blame the man at the top.  And, frankly, can you
       remember when Congress's approval was anywhere above 35%?  Ever?
       "Congressional" approval doesn't matter, because everyone loves
       their particular representative.  The GOP is at 16% and will
       probably gain seats in 2014.
       Three more years of stagnant growth and high UE will leave the
       "average voter" hanking for some serious change in 2016.  Some
       posters on this site seem to believe that Hillary can be that
       change without selling out the Dem party.  I'm not so sure....

   What matters more is that hte sequester puts Republicans behind the
   eight ball with regard to cuts.

   Social Security, Medicare, and programs that serve the poorest and most
   vulnerable are mostly spared.

   Defense cuts are real.

   Living with the sequester will hurt the GOP more than it will hurt the
   Democrats.  GOP will need it to end before Democrats will, and that's
   crappy place to be when you're trying to negotiate.

   Unless, of course, Democrats prove to be gutless wonders who fold at
   the first sign of discomfort.

   be making Eric Cantor afraid to be seen in his district because so many
   MIC employees have been laid off.  Other than that, Obama is sliding in
   the polls because he's willing to dismantle FDR's legacy.  Obama's
   legacy is currently being dismantled by the GOP while he's still in
   office and O is helping them do it.  There are regrets all around.

       In this situation, FDR would be slicing the GOP to shreds.  Boehner

 It's Boehner's job, not ours, stupid! ([472]0+ / 0-)

   The GOP, especially Speaker Boehner, will dig in to keep the sequester
   going at all costs. Until now, Boehner's hold on the gavel was truly
   shaky. Boehner "sold out" on the fiscal cliff tax raise, Hurricane
   Sandy aid, and passing the Violence Against Women act, all with Nancy
   Pelosi bringing over the votes. Boehner has to make his last ditch
   stand on the sequester.  GOPer Steve Scalise, in his "lobster Red"
   Pelican State 1st CD, and his friends are cheering him on for not
   giving in. Remember, it's all about Boehner's job, not ours, stupid!

 This is scary... ([476]0+ / 0-)

   "According to a CBS News poll, 53% says that the sequester will impact
   them personally, 39% say it will not impact them.
    However, the "blame" numbers are far more interesting. 38% of
   respondents blame "Republicans in Congress" for the failure to reach an
   agreement to avoid sequestration. 33% blame "Obama/Democrats in
   Congress". While that is a 5 point lead for the President and the
   Democrats, it's a statistically insignificant one. It's certainly not
   enough to make the definitive claim that President Obama has the upper
   hand in this debate.

   It gets better. Among independents, 33% blame the GOP, while 31% blame
   the President and the Dems. That's even less statistically significant
   than when partisans are included. It's basically a tie.

   Bottom line: It doesn't appear, at this point anyway, that Republicans
   will be suffering politically now that sequestration has happened. We
   think that is a good thing."

   I saw another poll that showed the repubs with 44% to 40% Obama with
   the question who can handle the budget the best.
