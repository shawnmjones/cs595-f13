   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   Late Night Snark: Impeachapalooza Edition!

     "If you watch the news like I do, you know the Obama administration
     is embroiled in so many scandals that trying to pick which one to
     report on is like trying to pick which of your children to impeach.
     For the record, it's the one who ate chips in Daddy's den."
     ---Stephen Colbert

   President Barack Obama participates in a literacy lesson with children
   while visiting a pre-kindergarten classroom at Moravia Elementary
   School in Baltimore, Md., May 17, 2013. (Official White House Photo by
   Pete Souza)
   "And that's how you write 'Darrell
   Issa Will Never Be President.'"
   -

     "If they don't fix these crises pretty soon, honest to God, it could
     bring gridlock to a screeching halt."
     ---David Letterman

     Clip of Peggy Noonan on Meet the Press last week: All three of these
     scandals makes a cluster that implies some very bad things. This is
     so broad. This IRS thing is something I've never seen in my
     lifetime.
     Jon Stewart: Never in your lifetime have you seen a scandal this
     bad? What if a President secretly sold weapons to Iran in return for
     American hostages, and then used the proceeds to illegally fund a
     bunch of coked-up right-wing jungle rapists in Nicaragua? Ring a
     bell? Here's a hint: you worked in his White House as a high-profile
     speechwriter.
     ---The Daily Show (watch it in [29]BruinKid's post.)

     "Politics aside, should we be surprised that the IRS takes special
     attention to the tax forms of the Tea Party? Judging from the
     terrible spelling on their protest signs, attention to detail isn't
     really their thing."
     ---Seth Meyers

     According to a new survey, white Americans are more likely to see
     President Obama as angry than black Americans. After hearing about
     it, Obama got really angry, according to white Americans.
     ---Conan O'Brien

     They spent the last five years claiming President Obama was weak and
     ineffective. Suddenly he's Tony Soprano?
     ---Jay Leno

   And two years ago:

     "Y'know, there's a specific group of Americans out there whose name
     I won't mention---but it begins with 'T' and ends with
     'baggers'---and they have a habit of saying, 'I want my country
     back.' Well, I want my country forward."
     ---Bill Maher

   Enjoy your Memorial Day weekend. It's the last one you're gonna get for
   a whole year. Your west coast-friendly edition of  Cheers and Jeers
   starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!]

   Cheers and Jeers for Friday, May 24, 2013

   Notes: 1) C&J will not appear on Monday or Tuesday.  Back Wednesday
   with no recollection of what the hell happened during the previous 96
   hours.  2) Because of the holiday, Monday trash pickup in Portland has
   been moved to tomorrow.  Remember that the governor goes in the non
   recycle bin.  3) I'll be on the road when this C&J gets put up, so no
   tip jar tonight.  Whoever posts first will receive "much luck and
   fortune for good your family and aquntenaces in happytime for life in
   bed," according to this fortune cookie I just cracked open.  ---Mgt.

   Puppy Pic of the Day:  The way I see it, there's two kinds of people in
   this world: those who use 3-D printers to make guns that take lives,
   and those who use 3-D printers to [32]make things other than guns that
   save lives.

   CHEERS to multitasking.  As our endorphins go wild over the prospect
   that our first warm-weather holiday weekend is upon us (well, your
   first warm-weather holiday weekend, since we'll be lucky to hit 50 here
   on the coast of Maine, and snow is forecast for the highest elevations
   of New England), [33]Amy Goodman reminds us in the Madison Capital
   Times that...
   Memorial Day 2011 editorial illustration by John Cole

     Memorial Day, while for many not much more than a three-day weekend,
     will be marked by many solemn ceremonies.  At the time of this
     writing, the most recent U.S. deaths in Afghanistan were two
     soldiers from the Pacific island of Guam, Sgt. Eugene M. Aguon, 23,
     and Spc. Dwayne W. Flores, 22, killed by a so-called improvised
     explosive device on May 16. Unreported by the Pentagon are the
     hundreds of soldier and veteran suicides, which now account for more
     deaths than combat. The backlog at Veterans Affairs, as of May 20,
     was more than 873,000 benefits claims pending, 584,000 of which were
     pending for more than 125 days.

     Thomas Paine wrote in the March 21, 1778, edition of his pamphlet
     The Crisis, "If there is a sin superior to every other, it is that
     of willful and offensive war ... he who is the author of a war, lets
     loose the whole contagion of hell, and opens a vein that bleeds a
     nation to death."

   And while you're at it, take a few extra moments to reflect on Dwight
   Eisenhower's words: "I hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can,
   only as one who has seen its brutality, its futility, its stupidity."
   Me, too.  Minus the living it part, but I'll take his word for it.

   CHEERS to Robert Allen Zimmerman.  You know him better as Duluth-born
   Bob Dylan, and today we wish him a happy 72nd birthday. No one in my
   conservative family listened to Dylan when I was growing up (it was
   classical, showtunes, Bread, John Denver and The Carpenters in our
   house, which is why I think I'm somehow related to Ned Flanders), and I
   don't remember anyone playing him when I went to college in the early
   80's. So, Dylan never made it on my mix tapes, sorry to say. But I'm
   smart enough to know a living legend when I see one. And judging by his
   summer tour schedule (he was here in Maine just last month), he
   [34]ain't slowin' down any.  Here he is in Newport a month before I was
   born:

   IFRAME: [35]http://www.youtube.com/embed/OeP4FFr88SQ

   His Wikipedia entry is like a museum---you could [36]get lost in it.
   Many blessings on your camels, Bob.  And thanks for Blowin' in the
   Wind.  Best. Fart. Song. Ever.

   CHEERS to the original texter. On May 24, 1844, Samuel F.B. Morse
   transmitted the first telegraph message: [37]"What hath God wrought."
   The telegraph went on to become an indispensable communications device
   that wowed the world.  On the downside: no camera, no apps, and it took
   six months to play one screen of Angry Birds.

   CHEERS to one step forward on the hiking trail to equality.  You could
   see the writing on the wall---literally---yesterday when the Boy Scouts
   of America voted on a national policy allowing openly-gay young'uns to
   join.  After all, when the organization formed by Lord Baden Powell
   chooses to hold their meeting at the Gaylord Texan, you can [38]kinda
   predict the outcome:
   Gaylord Texan Hotel logo
   Helloooooo...!!!

     Over 61 percent of Scouting's National Council of 1,232 delegates
     from across the country voted to lift the ban, BSA officials said.
     ... Pascal Tessier, a gay 16-year-old from Kensington, Md., felt
     hopeful after the vote. He believes he can get his Eagle rank---the
     Scouts' highest honor---in the fall. "There are a lot of things
     going through my head," he said. "The initial reaction is ecstatic
     because I can go home and tell everyone that I'm still a Boy
     Scout."...

     Zach Wahls, an Eagle Scout son of lesbian moms and founder of
     [39]Scouts for Equality, said it was "hard to overstate" how
     important it was for the Boy Scouts to even consider weakening the
     policy.  "Even though I think that there will probably still be a
     few folks who choose to walk away ... I think this is the beginning
     of the rebound of Scouting in America," he said.

   The leadership domino will fall soon enough.  But for now we'll just
   say congratulations, kids.  Your first mission: go to the
   quartermaster's tent and get me a bacon stretcher, a wind shifter, and
   a sturdy bag to hold in the woods after dark to catch the feathered
   critters we send in your direction during tonight's snipe hunt.  (heh
   heh...)

   CHEERS to true visionaries.  Two hundred and twenty six years ago
   tomorrow, on May 25, 1787, the Constitutional Convention [40]opened in
   Philadelphia with George Washington presiding.  They came to blows over
   their first order of business, but after much chair-throwing and
   cane-beating, they finally agreed: We hereby resolve that Cheesesteak
   shall not be considered Cheesesteak without Cheez Whiz.  It was smooth
   sailing from there.
   Michael Douglas as Liberace
   I wonder if Michael Douglas will utter
   Liberace's immortal response to his
   critics: "I'm crying all the way to the bank."
   CHEERS to home vegetation. Here's the weekend haps on the teevee,
   starting with the Sunday HBO movie that's getting [41]faaaabulous
   reviews and---SPOILER ALERT---will earn Michael Douglas an Emmy:
   [42]Liberace: Behind the Candelabra, directed by Steven Soderbergh,
   co-starring Matt Damon, Dan Aykroyd, Rob Lowe and Debbie Reynolds, and
   featuring the late Marvin Hamlisch's last score.  New DVD releases
   include Ahhnuld's return to Hollywood in The Last Stand and dueling
   hams Pacino and Walken in Stand Up Guys.  Your MLB, NBA and NHL
   schedules can be found [43]here, [44]here and [45]here.  The [46]Indy
   500 is Sunday, and will feature a return of [47]Jim Nabors---hopefully
   with his newly-wedded husband, Stan---to sing "Back Home Again In
   Indiana."  On [48]60 Minutes: a repeat of the firsthand account of the
   raid on the bin Laden compound from one of the SEALs who was there.

   On [49]Bill Moyers & Company, Tim DeChristopher tells why he spent
   nearly two years in prison in the name of environmental justice, and
   Gretchen Morgenson discusses how banks are still too big to fail and
   too big to trust.  And here's your Sunday morning zzzzzzzzzzzzzzfest:
   Meet the Press---old set
   The 'Meet the Press' set
   will be empty Sunday. But
   will anybody even notice?
   -

     Meet the Press: Sweet, sweet words from their website: "Meet the
     Press will not air on May 26."  But John McCain will be dropped off
     there anyway so the janitor can babysit him while Cindy goes
     shopping.

     This Week: Sen. Rand Paul (R-1950); retired Gen. John Allen takes a
     victory lap after being cleared in the Petraeus affair scandal that
     was WAY WORSE THAN WATERGATE!!!  Plus two "powerhouse" roundtables
     featuring pundits of no consequence or gravitas.

     Face the Nation: Sens. Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY);
     author Joseph Persico on his new book about FDR during World War II;
     Climate Central's Heidi Cullen, the American Meteorological
     Society's Marshall Shepherd and WFOR Chief Meteorologist Dave
     Bernard on, like, weather 'n stuff; plus some pundits of no
     consequence or gravitas.

     CNN's State of the Union: Who knows?  They never update their web
     site in time.  There's a term for that, y'know---it rhymes with
     "Bazy Basses."

     Fox GOP Talking Points Sunday: Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Lindsay
     Graham (R-Fussbucketville); former Sen. Bob Dole (R-KS) on the
     meaning of Memorial Day; roundtable featuring people of no
     consequence or gravitas, like Brit Hume.

   And if none of that floats your boat, there are 15 brand-new episodes
   of Arrested Development [50]going up on Netflix Sunday.  Happy viewing!

   Five years ago in C&J: May 24, 2008

   HA HA! to Opposite Man.  Chalk up another prediction gone sour for Bill
   Kristol, the right-wing pundit who is So Serious and So Accurate that
   he now writes non-serious, inaccurate columns for the New York Times.
   One year ago he wrote a column in Time magazine on the [51]state of the
   2008 presidential races.  Let's see how his words are holding up:
   Bill Kristol on Fox News
   Old fools never die. They
   just end up at Fox News.

     Absent surprises, this looks on the Democratic side like a classic
     G.O.P. race, in which the Establishment candidate (in this case,
     Clinton) maintains a lead, is challenged by one or two slightly more
     exciting competitors and, after a bump or two on the road, ends up
     prevailing.

   Hey, Bill: Surprise!

   -

   And just one more...

   CHEERS to the birth of the Great Orange Satan.  We won't be around
   Sunday, so tonight we wish this site's merry band of muckrakers and
   misfits an early blast from the confetti cannon for eleven years of
   blogging goodness.  It all started when a dirty fucking hippie named
   Markos Hemp Flower Rainbow Prius Moonbat Moulitsas emerged from his
   law-school cocoon and flapped his dove wings on [52]May 26, 2002:
   Young Markos Moulitsas
   Kos, caught in the act of
   destroying America on Tuesday.
   (Hovering black helicopter photo)

     I am progressive. I am liberal. I make no apologies. I believe
     government has an obligation to create an even playing field for all
     of this country's citizens and immigrants alike. I am not a
     socialist. I do not seek enforced equality. However, there has to be
     equality of opportunity, and the private sector, left to its own
     devices, will never achieve this goal.

   "The" Daily Kos stewed in its juices for a bit before I discovered it
   (via the Dean for America blog) and got addicted to the [53]cattle
   calls.  The rest, as they say, is, literally, history.  Despite the
   meta wars, sigh-inducing GBCWs, and the sheer crazy volume of
   information that gets posted every day, it's still a kickass source of
   netroots-level analysis, opinion, issue-vetting, fundraising, snarking,
   storytelling and flying furniture, the heart and soul of which is the
   room full of 837,539 concerned cats (source: [54]jotter) that only a
   danged fool would try to herd.  So from all of me to all of
   you---especially you, Kos, our mighty [55]Keyboard Kingpin---Happy 11th
   blogiversary from user ID #2574.  May your hearts remain
   progressive...and your hands filled with pies.

   Have a safe and fun weekend.  Oh, and from now 'til Labor Day, you can
   wear white white white white white white WHITE!!!  Floor's open...What
   are you cheering and jeering about today?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [69]Tagging tips - [70]Search For Tags - [71]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [72]Civil
   Rights, [73]Community, [74]Congress, [75]Culture, [76]Economy,
   [77]Education, [78]Elections, [79]Energy, [80]Environment, [81]Health
   Care, [82]International, [83]Labor, [84]Law, [85]Media, [86]Meta,
   [87]National Security, [88]Science, [89]Transportation, or [90]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([91]California, [92]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       is it should be WHITE, not yellowish or white with spots.  Those

   White gloves, patent leather shoes/bags, and white shoes (even those we
   used to dye pastel to match our prom dresses) are from Memorial Day to
   Labor Day. Of course, what did we know, we wore multiple scratchy
   petticoats and pointy bras, and even the skinnys wore panty girdles,
   until knee highs came along. For a while white bucks were popular, and
   I wouldn't been seen w/o my "buck bag" of chalk to keep my shoes whiter
   than white.

       we wore white gloves to church year round.
       the rest seems to agree with me...white shoes only between Memorial
       Day and Labor Day.

       youth (50s into early 60s) where I am wearing a dress with white
       hat, shoes, gloves, and carrying a matching purse!!  Me - who now

       to school, and that east wind in Portland was brutal in the winter.
       By my junior year white bucks were out, and flats were in. My dad
       hated them, as they were not appropriate for wearing in the rain.
       But, I bought my own school clothes, so wore them anyway. High
       school kids just want to fit in. Like you, I live in jeans (Levis)
       and sweaters/sweatshirts/button shirts/t shirts, with only a few
       clothes appropriate for things like funerals. I buy lightweight
       chambray men's shirts on sale to wear gardening. Size small is
       perfect for me, and men's clothes is a heck of a lot cheaper than
       women's

       ever notice!  Recently I wanted a new gray hoodie.  Nothing fancy,
       just a plain gray sweatshirt.  I had to buy it in the men's dept.
       because there is NO SUCH THING as a plain gray woman's hoodie.
       They are all covered in bling!
       As a kid (and well into my teens) I waged a constant battle to wear
       pants to class.  Even in the dead of winter we could not wear pants
       - and northern NJ got quite cold.  I never understood why we needed
       to freeze.  And no one ever gave me a good explanation.  "Because
       girls don't wear pants to school" is NOT an explanation.

   WHILE NOT EVERYONE in Europe has been pleased with the work of "Da

   economy (due to the Euro crisis) the head of the city council of the

   Alighieri (set in the city of Florence) will provide a financial boost.

   missing in Colorado (while on a family vacation) but was located due to
   her microchip.

   THIS COMING SUNDAY I will feature Odds & Ends - a diary of my postings
   for this week, circa noon Eastern (9 AM Pacific). I hope you'll vote in
   the "Who Lost the Week?!?" poll (a mirror image of the one Bill posts
   here). Dang, there are already bushel baskets of misfits lined-up for
   your review (such as Chad Ochocinco, Gov. Tom Corbett, the Canadian
   prime minister's chief of staff, Virginia's Lt. Gov. candidate, Sen.
   James Inhofe, Joe Arpaio and golfer Sergio Garcia) .... and the week's
   not over yet.

   FRIDAY's CHILD #2 is [615]Explorer the Cat - a Florida kitteh who was
   rescued by firefighters responding to a house fire, who then returned
   to his family ... after he just needed some oxygen to counteract the
   smoke inhalation.

   FROM TIME-TO-TIME there is a new fringe party in Britain (with
   anti-immigrant, Christian right, anti-European and the racial attitudes
   to go with that). In the past, the British National Party and the
   English Defence League played that role. Now, a reporter for the
   Guardian talks with representatives for the latest contender, the
   [618]UK Independence Party and sees that - try as they might to have a
   new, clean image - they're fishing in the same waters as their
   predecessors.

   OLDER-YOUNGER SISTERS? - CNN host Erin Burnett [619]and film star Zooey
   Deschanel.

   ......and finally, for a song of the week ............... my new job is
   off to a good start, but the first two weeks have been hectic. And so
   no time for a full musical profile today (hope to return to normal next
   week).... instead, just a quick look at one of the most memorable songs
   ever to appear on network television.

      You may be wondering why - in this January 13, 1968 episode of
   [622]Get Smart - that secret agents Maxwell Smart and Agent 99 seem to
   be ... getting down with the music .... in what [623]TV Guide named as
   #67 in its 100 Greatest TV episodes of All Time .... well, here's an
   explanation:

                     [624][SacredCows3_zps51137c56.jpg]

     Many of the country's teenagers are dancing constantly, under the
     spell of the Groovy Guru, who is helping KAOS take over the country
     via its teenagers. The CONTROL agents who are sent after the Guru
     end up dancing under his spell also.

     Max and 99 head into the Guru's meditation palace to stop the Guru,
     armed with a lie pill in case of capture. They discover that the
     Guru plans to incite the nation's youth to riot and destroy all
     government institutions. The Guru will accomplish this by
     broadcasting a special song (sung by the Sacred Cows) during his
     live broadcast ..... unless CONTROL can stop him.

   As Agent 99 indicates ... the Sacred Cows ... are the "hottest rock
   group in the country" ............ although just what country isn't
   revealed.

   Portraying the Guru is the star of "F Troop", [625]Larry Storch - who
   is still alive at age 90, bless him - and in the photo left, doesn't it
   look like he's got an early edition of an Apple laptop? Meanwhile,
   [626]The Sacred Cows were session musicians Jerry Scheff (bass) John
   Greek (guitar) & Ben Benay (guitar).

                     [628][SacredCows2_zps3c9182be.jpg]

   You'll just have to watch the (short) video below to learn if the world
   was saved or not ..... but here are the [629]lyrics that threatened our
   world, forty-five years ago ....

     Thrill, thrill, thrill
     Kill, kill, kill
     Make the scene,
     Knock off a Dean

     Yeah, yeah, yeah
     Bump off a square
     That's what it's all about
     Hate is in
     Love is out

   Jeers to not being able to take any pain killers until tomorrow
   (medical procedure today that meant nothing other than Tylenol after
   Tuesday noon and Tylenol doesn't really work very well for me).  My
   back is killing me (ruptured disks), my ankles are killing me (torn
   Achilles tendon), and I thought after today I would be in better shape.
    Nope.  After tomorrow.  I am going to be much happier after tomorrow.

   never leave their bedrooms, or at least their front yard.

   Maybe there's a groundswell of support for outdoorsmanship that I am
   completely unaware of, and is largely invisible.

   I see no evidence in my neighborhood of any youthfull urge to go
   camping, or go fishing, or hiking...or even to walk outside long enough
   to collect the mail.  (besides...collecting the mail is the parents'

   Cheers to Bob Dylan, even though his songs sound a whole lot better
   when sung by Joan Baez.

   Cheers to the Chuck Card.  Some Cleveland restaurant owners presented a
   card to local hero Charles Ramsey, who helped rescue the 3 women held
   prisoner by Ariel Castro.  Cheers that when he first thought it was "a
   domestic violence situation," he didn't use that as an excuse to ignore
   it.  Cheers that perhaps the next person witnessing more mundane
   violence will remember heroes like him and do the right thing.

   Jeers to having heard tom Tancredo's name today.

   Jeers to mile-wide tornadoes.  Cheers to all the people who reached out
   to help a neighbor.

   Jeers to people who are still in denial about climate change.

   Jeers to having the same conversations about sexism that I remember
   from 20 years ago.  It's getting old, and then some.

   Cheers to my wife.  Cheers to the hope that our marriage will soon be
   legal in every state.  C'mon, Supremes!

   ...not necessarily in that order.

   It's been a while since I've gotten into the Kiddie Pool at such a
   relatively early time. I've been learning lots of German, and while I'm
   glad to be going "home" to France for 3 weeks at the end of next week,
   I'm sorry that won't end up finishing the Integrationskurs with the
   same group of people I've been with since the end of January.

   I will be finishing the course (which goes to level B1) starting the
   last half of August, after which I will probably take The Official Test
   in (I think) October. It remains to be seen if I will go onward with
   B2, C1, and C2. These are not subsidized by Germany. On the other hand,
   I'm learning German for my own pleasure (no, really!) and benefit, so
   going on until I could conceivably handle enrolling in a German
   university would be... well, likely crazy.

   Only other thing to report (as it were) is that Mr Mo and I have taken
   up snooker. We both play regular billiards (OK, pool) reasonably well,
   but man, snooker is a very different and much more difficult game. The
   table itself is ginormous, and we're lucky that our favorite pool hall
   even has one. The balls are too damned small and the pockets are
   completely unforgiving. My hat is off to anyone who can come close to
   playing even a little bit [1209]like this. It'll be a while before I
   come close, that's for sure.

   Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the
   fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first
   existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher
   consideration. -- [DEL: K.Marx :DEL] A.Lincoln

       That's what won the House majority in 2006. Problem is, Rahm
       Emanuel a) thought the DCCC (which, coincidently, he led) was what
       achieved that, and b) deeply disliked (and dislikes) Howard Dean.

   Looking forward to a 10 day weekend. (that's what you get when you take
   the other four days off) When it is done, I hope to have one new book
   finished and one revised and ready for formatting.

   Eddie C--perfect Memorial Day photos. It's a very old-fashioned looking

   I have no idea why they changed it, though FoD does have a nice ring.

   I don't recall how it was handled in Kinsella's book, but the movie is
   a total FAIL with regard to Moonlight Graham's cuppa coffee in the bigs
   (and much else about him).

   In the movie, I think they place his one appearance in 1922, and in an
   end-of-season game. In fact, Graham's game was on [1612]June 29, 1905.
   In the movie, the time-travel meeting between Ray and Doc Graham
   happens in 1972, but the real Graham died in 1965. I believe the movie
   says he was a Chisholm native who had returned home to doctor his
   hometown; the real Graham was born in Fayetteville NC.

   Finally, in the movie young Archie bats righthanded, but the real
   Graham was a lefthanded hitter. Then again, Ray Liotta as Shoeless Joe
   was a BR/TL (a very rare combination, I might add), whereas the real
   Joe Jackson was BL/TR.

   Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the
   fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first
   existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher
   consideration. -- [DEL: K.Marx :DEL] A.Lincoln

   Special Awwww... Cheers to the animals who survived the tornado and

   delighted to see them.  At least one aspect of their lives is not
   gloomy and dark and sorrowful when they have someone they love back.
   Really, one can survive tragedy with a little love and security, and
   that's what these pets and people can provide for each other.

   As an exercise in paying attention for the last couple of days, I have
   been looking for flame colored cars.  This morning, before I got down
   the hill, I had 8 cars/pickups of a bright enough red, and one
   motorcycle; there were 3 orange cars and a yellow truck.  Before I got
   to the bus stop from there, I had added three yellow trucks and two red
   ones, two yellow cars and another 6 red - and that's with most of the
   red cars out there being too dull a shade to qualify.  Today's count
   was: 25 bright red cars, three trucks, one motorcycle; 6 orange cars of
   varying shades and one truck; 5 yellow trucks and 12 cars.  Yesterday's
   count was only about 40, but two of the vehicles yesterday actually had
   flames painted on them.

   It's a great evening to be alive!

   Greetings from Baker City, Oregon! All good on this end of the
   internets. Had a fine 3 days of fun getting to eastern OR. Gorgeous
   views, pleasant driving even when I'm 30 foot long, very, very,
   well-behaved dogs, many miles to any collapsed bridges, and free booze
   now being served at the picnic table.

   Had a really great meet-up with another kossack last evening--Boise
   Blue! She is uber-cool, and even came out to the campground to meet me.
   How's that for hospitality? We chatted & chatted, til it got cold (yay!
   cold!) & dark--which happenes late up here north of my usual spot...

   So far, so good.
   Peace.

   The better I know people, the more I like my dog.

   Jeers, obviously, because the asshole Congress gets paid for doing
   nothing - unlike me and my co-workers, today (first of 5 to 7 before
   Sept. 30).

   Fortunately I have no kids and I save like a squirrel with OCD, so this
   loss of a week's salary will only be an irritating pinch in my wallet.
   My heart goes out to co-workers with kids in college and steep
   mortgages to deal with.

   OTOH, I got a hell of a lot of non-paid work done today - as if I
   switched into hyper-springcleaning drive the second I shoulder-rolled
   out of bed, and as if in defiance of the "no work" order (not even
   allowed to check our voice messages). Things got cleaned that had lain
   fallow around here for years. I ache like a marathoner right now, but
   my postage-stamp of a back yard is now fit for summer entertaining, and
   the shed is no longer toxic.
