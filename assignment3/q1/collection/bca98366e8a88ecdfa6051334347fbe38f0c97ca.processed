[103]Reps. Israel vs. Blackburn: Obama wavering on Syria?

   U.S. Reps. Steve Israel (D-NY) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) joined hosts
   Stephanie Cutter and Newt Gingrich in the Crossfire to talk about
   President Obama's response on Syria and whether or not to trust the
   Russian plan for Syria to hand over its chemical arsenal to
   international control.

   Rep. Blackburn said President Obama "wavers between having a military
   and a political solution" for Syria, while Rep. Israel countered that
   "we've got to keep all the options on the table."

       Putin and Assad see America's divisiveness and are are taking full
       advantage of it
       Russia's Vladimir Putin got his air time in the New York Times
       yesterday in his "A Plea for Caution from Russia: What Putin Has to
       Say to Americans about Syria." This diatribe is more than
       diplomatic words of conciliation and negotiation for the sake of
       peace. It is also a threat and a reprimand. He and Syria are in no
       position to take that stance now.
       Putin called for Syria to sign onto the chemical weapons' ban
       treaty and it did today. That's good, but it's only a mass murderer
       putting his name on a piece of paper. Immediately thereafter, Putin
       reprimanded the U.S. and our President in the Times. Now Putin and
       his child- murdering colleague Assad are emboldened to dictate
       terms and timeframes for Syria giving up its chemical weapons.
       Putin writes that Americans must "take advantage of the Syrian
       government's willingness to place its chemical arsenal under
       international control for subsequent destruction." How noble. These
       vultures see America's divisiveness and are taking full advantage
       of it. Why is Assad so anxious to do the right thing a few weeks
       after gassing and murdering children. Did he find Christ last
       night? (Then again, many dead men walking on death row in prisons
       do just that!)
       I can't even believe the absurd criticisms levied by many Congress
       people, the media, commentators, and others against President Obama
       for his actions and stance on Syria this week. This divisiveness
       has only given rise to Putin's and Assad's seeming overnight
       willingness to be reasonable members of the international
       community. Who cares what Assad says; he murdered children a few
       days ago! And that makes Putin guilty by association of the same
       madness.
       The bottom line criticism is that Obama is flip-flopping and all
       over the map with his stance. Not true at all. He made up his mind
       on what needed to be done weeks ago. He's just giving the
       diplomatic route a little more time; hopefully, very little.
       Treaties and promises will not change Assad's behavior, especially
       in the midst of a civil war; cruise missiles will.
       The night before Congress was to vote on the attack, John Kerry and
       Putin said Syria might be able to avoid a U.S. military strike IF
       Assad agrees to give in to U.S. demands on his stockpiling and use
       of chemical weapons. For Kerry, this meant waiting a few days "to
       give peace a chance" before a strike. To Putin, it seems to mean
       long-term negotiations and processes with how and when to shut down
       Syria's chemical weapons, requiring quite a long time. This is
       little more than an arrogant political ploy by Putin and Assad to
       buy time. And Obama's critics are really giving them that privilege
       of time-and already calling the shots.
       Correctly so, President Obama said he would wait a little while for
       Assad to act properly, and show good faith. He delayed the vote on
       the military strike ready to be taken by Congress. These actions
       are what a logical, reasonable man would do. What was his choice?
       To say "I don't believe Putin or Assad, and I no longer have time
       to wait for a congressional vote, so I'm launching a strike
       tomorrow? Of course not. That sounds like a dictator...like Putin
       and Assad!
       If Assad does not quickly follow America's non-negotiated
       requirements on what to do and when to shut down its chemical
       weapons' capabilities, America should unilaterally strike them down
       and soon. "Leaders" like Putin and Assad only respect strength and
       aggression. Let us not forget Ronald Regan's iconic approach to the
       Cold War: the only way is "peace through strength." Obama is
       actually trying to follow the lead of the great Republican
       communicator!

       How come Newt & S.E. are described in their bio's as "conservative"
       as if that was bad by the way it's stated, yet Cutter & Jones no
       where is it mentioned they are liberals? I'm sure Newt & SE are
       proud to e called conservative. Would Cutter & Jones be happy with
       the moniker of liberal...I think not. How come there was no mention
       of Jones at one time being a card carrying communist?
