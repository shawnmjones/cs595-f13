One nation, still with birth control

   Artist [3]Michele Pred sends this take on the American flag, made
   of1,443 hand-painted birth control pills. At 11" by 14", "Promote the
   General Welfare" is part of Pred's new project on reproductive rights.
   Pred crowd-sources material for her work -- each pill is only about a
   quarter-inch around -- and she needs more to finish the series.

   If you're in New York City this summer, you can see "Promote the
   General Welfare" for yourself at the [4]Nancy Hoffman Gallery.

   Each pill is 1/4 inch AROUND? Or ACROSS? If they are 1/4 inch around,
   then they are very Very tiny, as their diameters would be 0.25 inch
   divided by pi, or about 0.0795 inch in diameter.

   Where did she get these pills? Where they expired and then donated?
   Where they donated placebo pills? As a liberal, pro-choice feminist I
   would be pretty offended by this if they were perfectly good birth
   control pills. If they were, that's 48 packs, or a 4 year supply of
   birth control pills that this artist wasted for her artistic expression
   that could have gone to someone else that may not have access to birth
   control pills or may not be able to afford what some planned
   parenthood's charge for a month's supply of birth control pills i.e.
   Missouri charges between $10-$15 for their cheapest pills before
   tacking on the office visit fee (minimum $10 dollars).

   I would like to know the source of her materials. As someone who cannot
   afford birth control, her little art project feels like a slap in the
   face and I know I can't be the only woman who feels the same way.

   Even if they were placebo or expired, she should make it clear so
   others don't think it's a potentially huge waste. It offers credence to
   the right wing fallacy of birth control being dirt cheap.

   Danielle Priest and XCXV2: You must be kidding. This art has nothing to
   do with your difficulty in obtaining birth control pills, any more than
   the use of pills in this piece is an insult to women who want to get
   pregnant but can't. There is no connection. The artist has made a
   statement about the importance of birth control to women in America.
   Presumably, that means you. What are you doing, taking pot shots at an
   ally? Your umbrage should be directed at your insurer, the
   pharmaceutical company, or the Tea Party members of the GOP, like Rand
   Paul, who seem to think birth control is women's way of blocking God's
   shots.

   It's not like she flushed them down the toilet - she created a
   wonderful political statement that seeks to bolster supporters of
   contraception, pointing out that we're the ones who honor our country's
   ideals of individual liberty and democracy.

   If food colouring were used, the pills would still be useable. That's a
   three-year supply in that photo.

   Republicans should remember that birth control pills are only a tax
   write off if they DON"T work!

   That should be a bumper sticker and a lawn sign! (I'm a suburbanite
   with a lawn.) It says so much in just a few words.

   Is there a significance to 1443 that I am missing?

   Crowd source birth control pills? I hope someone is keeping track of
   which ones they skip!

   If the critics of the materials in this art would click on the link to
   the artist's site, they would see that she is asking for donations of
   unwanted pills as materials--expired, placebo, missed. She states this
   very clearly to those who would look.

   Even still, this artwork could be taken out of context . And call it a
   hunch, I think Repubs are satanic enough to do just that.

   This birth control pill flag IS awesome! And I am assuming a
   one-of-a-kind, since it won't be able to reproduce. (So sorry. It's the
   heat...)

   OKAY GIRLS! If THEY take away what you need. You take away what "THEY"
   need.

   You got the power.

   Want to see why the speed of light looks like once women take back
   their power?

   Hello! I would really like to help someone who is having side effects
   from taking birth control pills. This is what my mom says : Since I was
   taking Yaz birth control pills for a long time , and I had terrible
   nightmares after that I managed to reach a company that takes care of
   problems like mine. I have received great financial compensation and I
   would advice you to try that as well if you have experienced side
   effects.This is the place where I found about this law company -
   [68]http://www.allgreatonlinedeals.com/birth-control-side-effects-how-t
   o-get-financial-compensation-for-your-yaz-side-effectsDon't hesitate to
   check if you are eligible for financial compensation. It takes 1
   minute.
   Good Luck!
