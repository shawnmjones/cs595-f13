   It appears almost too good to be true, but this little dog has been
   found alive and well adrift at sea, an astonishing three weeks after
   the tsunami that devastated Japan.

   Members of the Japan Coast Guard came across the dog on Friday as they
   were conducting an aerial search of the area.

   Against all the odds, the dog appears to have survived by living in a
   partially submerged house that had been swept out to sea.

   Local television showed showed pictures of the dog scampering around
   the roof of the house before it disappeared inside through a hole in
   the roof.

   Rescuers had hoped to find more tsunami survivors living inside the

   from the dog.

   Despite its three weeks at sea, the medium-sized brown dog seemed to be
   in reasonably good condition considering its ordeal.

   The discovery of the dog is a rare glimmer of hope in Japan where
   thousands of people are believed to have perished in the disaster.

   The nation is now gripped by the ongoing nuclear threat posed by the
   unstable Fukushima plant as workers continue to battle to restore vital
   cooling systems damaged by the quake.

   Just to follow-up: This dog turned out to be called Bun and she was at
   last reunited with her owner in her fifities living in Kesennuma. Her
   own house was partially destroyed by the Tsunami but remained allright
   basically. Bun had been missing for three weeks after the quake, but
   the owner instantly recognized her when she saw her on TV reporting
   about her rescue from the sea, and on the 4/March/11 they were happily
   reunited.

   Really brought a tear to my eye. We seldom forget the other side of
   these tragic events. The loss of any life, human or not, is always sad
   to accept. God bless the rescue teams for what they are going through
   and achieving. May Japan rise from this travesty in the way their
   character and culture has always done.

   Some of the idiots have commented here that perhaps dogs could survive
   without water for 2 weeks, and that could be the reason for him being
   found alive. No, that is not the reason, dogs are also like us, they
   can't survive without water for long, but this dog must have been
   drinking rain water, or licking some water that was found inside the
   house.. the house was almost intact as you could see in the video.

   Nobody had previously taught this little dog that it would probably die
   while floating on the roof while at sea. So it patiently waited to see
   what was going to happen which is more than many people would have done
   under the same conditions. Congratulations to the little dog for its
   perservance in waiting for its rescue!

   Japanese dogs are truly amazingly dedicated and loyal. They are
   exceptionally well behaved. Like everything Japanese, they are truly
   unique.

   The dog appeared to be in very good condition to have been afloat for
   this much time. I propose that the finding of the dog is the sad ending
   of a story that was more dramatic than we realize. I believe it likely
   that there was, in the beginning, a human survivor afloat with this
   loyal dog companion. This human and dog's full story will never be
   told, but I suppose the person cared for this dog, providing what basic
   needs they could find and share in the floating wreckage for food and
   drink. Sadly the human finally perished to the elements, not too long
   before the rescuers arrived to find the loyal dog still alive on the
   floating home they had once shared. This is a sad but hopeful story
   that I believe needs to be considered, because of the possibility it
   took place based on the otherwise unexplainable good condition of the
   dog.

   great story. I am a dog lover. I wonder how the pooch got fresh water.
   3 weeks without fresh water would be hard to believe. Must have had his
   own guardian angel maybe.
