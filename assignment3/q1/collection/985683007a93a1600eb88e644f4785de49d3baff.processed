   Myia Young, 4, places a candle by an American flag during a vigil for
   victims behind a theater where a gunman open fire at moviegoers in
   Aurora, Colorado July 20, 2012. A total of 71 people were shot in
   Friday's rampage at the Denver-area movie theat
   The NRA wants to punish lawmakers for trying to prevent more of these
   tragedies. Today, the voters speak.
   As voters head to the polls in both the Colorado Springs and Pueblo
   areas of Colorado, the Atlas Project has put together a
   [30]comprehensive look at the NRA-fueled recalls. Some of the more
   notable nuggets:
     * State Sen. President John Morse's SD-11 is 33.2 percent Dem, 25.1
       percent Republican, and 41.7 percent other. President Barack Obama
       got 61.2 percent of the vote, but Morse got just 50.6 percent of
       the vote in 2010. And Republicans have a plurality of "super
       voters"--those who voted in 2010, 2011 and 2012 elections in the
       district.
     * Sen. Angela Giron's SD-03 is 45.2 percent Dem, 22.9 percent
       Republican, and 31.9 percent other. President Barack Obama got 59.7
       percent of the 2012 two-way vote, and Giron got 55 percent of the
       vote in 2010. Democrats have a solid advantage in "super voters",
       14K versus 8K Republicans.
     * Yet word from my sources in the district has been that Morse is in
       better shape than Giron. Weird, if accurate.
     * Democrats dramatically outspent Republicans. Combined,
       Democratic-aligned groups spent $2.3 million, while GOP-aligned
       groups spent just $482K--$361K of that directly from the NRA.
       Indeed, without the NRA, there's no recall. Furthermore, most of
       the spending on the Democratic side has been from the campaigns
       themselves, not outside groups. (Note that our fundraising has been
       directly to the two candidates, which can use the money most
       effectively.)
     * You guys [31]contributed about $150K of the $913K raised by Angela
       Giron (16 percent), and $160K of the 658K raised by John Morse (24
       percent).
     * Democrats have run 2,346 of the 2,490 ads aired in the campaign.
       The Republicans running in the recalls haven't run a single ad. Now
       if either Democrat loses this recall, it'll be further proof for my
       theory that TV advertising is increasingly irrelevant. But this is
       a special case--Republican wingnuts don't need to be told by the TV
       box that there's a recall. They're activated and motivated. It's
       lower-performing Democratic voters that need to be educated and
       mobilized. Thus it follows that every single Republican ad in the
       race has been negative, but only two of the nine Democratic ads
       follow suit.
     * The inability to use vote-by-mail added dramatic uncertainty to the
       elections. In 2012, 52.6 percent of voters in SD-03, and 38.3
       percent in SD-11, voted by mail.

   Polls close at 6 pm PT/9 pm ET. Normally, we'd liveblog it on the front
   page, but Obama's Syria speech will have a liveblog of its own. So for
   Colorado updates, head on over to [32]Daily Kos Elections as soon as
   the polls close.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       this outcome, while at the same time knowing that worthless
       scumbags like Wis. Gov. Scott Walker and his bagmen cronies
       survived their own recalls.

 You probably don't have to worry about them being ([147]0+ / 0-)
       recalled.
       If the GOP didn't bother contributing, then they are just going to
       let the Democrats exhaust time & resources while they conserve them
       for 2014.....that is why the Dem party didn't contribute to the
       Walker recall.
       It's game theory. A recall election is always bad for the
       incumbent. The challenging party has little reason to waste money
       on a (usually) unproven & unprepared candidate if your opponent is
       forced to waste their time and money.
       After [148]AWB1 there was a recall in 1994 in California, the
       petition succeeded, the recall failed.
       And 1994 was a disaster.

       Aurora, Tucson, Newtown (to name a few).  Just be happy if the good

 Things have changed. ([166]0+ / 0-)
       Namely, support for gun rights have expanded since 1994, while
       [167]support for gun control has dropped significantly over the

       Because I find that polls asking about 'gun control' is very useful

   If the recall supporters lose both elections then it sends a chilling
   message to Republicans that they are definitely in the minority in
   Colorado and their policies are not supported.  It continues the
   narrative that Colorado is trending blue because Republicans are too
   extreme.  I doubt the Republican Party is blase about that image
   getting stuck in voters minds.  If the recall supporters win one or
   both then recalls or the threat of recalls will be the strategy de jour
   for disgruntled groups and we will see a proliferation of this
   technique across the states.  This game of strategies if about more
   than exhausting campaign coffers.

       I don't think the recall elections will succeed; the recall

       "all Americans are made safer"
       Banning objects from innocent people doesn't make anyone safer.

       about vote fraud since before he was elected, but he's uncovered
       exactly zero fraudulent votes.  He's also had his issues with
       trying to throw people off the voting roles because of their last
       names only to find out that they're valid voters.  He's an amateur
       compared to some of the Republicans who have been ruining elections
       around the country, but he's trying hard.
       Petitions gathered and signatures verified (including that of a
       woman who's been dead for two years) and that's not the only
       suspect signature and yet the SOS certifies that the election
       should proceed.  [541]http://coloradopols.com/....  That's from

 No - the woman named in the article I cited ([562]0+ / 0-)
       is definitely not alive to have signed the recall.  That has been
       proven, though the Secretary of State chose to accept the dead
       woman's signature.  How you can say that she's proven to have
       legitimately signed this petition is just willful stupidity or
       ignorance.  She's been dead two years.  There were others who
       claimed that their signatures were fraudulently placed on the
       petitions.  That the signatures weren't challenged in court doesn't
       suddenly make them legal or legitimate. It just means Morse and
       Giron thought it more important to put the subject up to the voters
       rather than fight legal fights forever.

   the language of the recall petitions not meeting the state
   Constitutional requirements.  The judge felt that the language
   substantially met the requirements and determined that any differences
   were not worth invalidating the whole recall.

   What I was referring to never did get challenged in court - the fact
   that a number of signatures should have been invalidated but they were
   upheld by the SOS (again, who has been a warrior against vote fraud
   when it serves his partisan interest) despite proof that they weren't
   legitimate.  Both Morse and Giron chose not to challenge them in court
   so their campaigns also decided to go on with the elections as the next
   step.

   There may or may not have been enough valid signatures - the SOS ruled
   there were, and since the campaigns didn't challenge the signatures,
   we'll never know.  I'm hopeful that the Senators will retain their
   seats despite cheating by the recall committees.

   Thanks for the link - it helped me to remember what happened and that I

 One of the measures passed was universal ([632]0+ / 0-)
       background checks.  That's to ensure that innocent people are
       cleared, and that people who shouldn't have guns don't get them.
       It's not banning objects from innocent people, unless you're
       talking magazine size, and then that's just a matter of how you
       define things - it's not banning magazines - people can still get
       magazines for their guns - as many as they want.  They just can't
       buy them with more than 15 rounds.  And I believe existing ones

       Colorado Democrats stood up and said we're going to have some

   Recommended by:
          [671]Glen The Plumber, [672]ColoTim

   On Aug 29 in a [673]comment, I posted two ads running in Pueblo, at
   least one on Comcast:

     Here's one of the latest attack ads against both Morse and Giron
     (the same major affiliates serve both Colorado Springs and Pueblo,
     so it's a twofer). This one is a slick, typical attack ad, complete
     with sinister "Inception" music and snippets of quotes taken out of
     context, with an unsubstantiated charge tossed in for good measure:

   [674]Pro-recall ad 1.

   Note that this ad is still running on Comcast. I've seen it on MSNBC
   and regular networks, plus numerous other odd channels that I can't
   remember off the top of my head. I believe Comcast runs their ads over
   the top of the network ads, and sometimes the Comcast ads will chop the
   first few seconds of the program itself.

   This is the [675]website named in the ad.

     Note the statement at the bottom of the page:

     Free Colorado is a non-profit organization registered in the State
     of Colorado.

   I've only seen the second one once, and I don't remember what channel
   it was on. These are the guys who started the recall effort in Pueblo,
   not actors:

   [676]Pro-recall ad 2.

   The first ad, the slick one with the sinister music and the cranky
   granny voice-over, has been running constantly, during the local news,
   late night talk shows, all sorts of programming. It's ubiquitous. I'll
   bet Comcast customers have it memorized, if they're not quick on the
   draw with the mute button.

       I understand that no one is reading this, so I'm posting info for
       reference and posterity.
       First, KRDO, the local ABC affiliate, just aired a video with a
       quote from the individual who initiated the recall here, Victor
       Head. He stated that, thus far, 33% of the folks who signed his
       petitions have not voted in the recall election. (video/transcript
       not yet posted to KRDO.com)
       Couple that with my above comment with the link to the video of Mr.
       Head encouraging bosses to drive their employees to the petition
       sites and get them to sign the petition, and I think we might know
       why 1/3 of the signers haven't bothered to vote...
       But [688]then we have this:

     More than two years after Daniel Knez died, he was mailed a voter ID
     card for the recall election in Pueblo County.

     Knez's daughter, Renee Curtis, said she was surprised when she saw
     the yellow card in the mail.
     "Right away I thought dishonesty," Curtis said.
       ZOMG!!! VOTER FRAUD!
       The FOXNews wannabe paper in Pueblo has been on a tear for several
       years with the GOPosaur party line cries of "voter fraud",
       especially when the Democratic state congress authorized mail-in
       ballot elections. You can bet that tomorrow's edition is going to
       go batshit crazy over this story, especially if Giron wins.
       Stay tuned for the legal explosion in Pueblo. (I wonder how many
       tax dollars the "frugal" Republicans will spend investigating
       non-existent voter fraud and trumped up "irregularities" which cost
       them the $300k recall (if they lose).)
