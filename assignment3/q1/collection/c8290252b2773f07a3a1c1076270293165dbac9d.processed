   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   Late Night Snark...with 100% Humidity

     "Republicans are already trying to paint Hillary Clinton as too old
     to be president. In fact, a new ad claims she's so old that she
     could be a Republican."
     ---Conan O'Brien

   George Takei/Sulu joke

     "Osama bin Laden once got a speeding ticket in Pakistan. This guy
     had no respect for the law. When SEAL Team 6 broke into the house,
     he said to them: 'Is this about that speeding ticket?'"
     ---David Letterman
     -
     "The Supreme Court struck down the part of the Voting Rights Act
     which protected minority voting in areas where it needed to be
     protected. Their reasoning is that we don't need it anymore. Racism
     is basically over in America, so let's get back to talking about
     Trayvon Martin and Paula Deen."
     ---Bill Maher.
     -
     "President Obama is getting a new limousine that will have advanced
     night-vision capabilities. The technology even has a cool name. It's
     called headlights."
     ---Jimmy Fallon

   And three years ago:

     Clip of RNC Chairman Michael Steele: That's one thing you don't do,
     is engage in a land war in Afghanistan. This was a war of Obama's
     choosing. This is not something that the United States has actively
     prosecuted or wanted to engage in.

     Jon Stewart: Okay. Forget about the fact that we've been in
     Afghanistan since before Obama was even a gleam in the Senate's eye.
     Forget about the fact that this non-act of war has cost the United
     States thousands of casualties, and just focus on this: this is the
     head of the Republican party going after one of the party's core
     principles: blowing shit up in other countries.
     ---The Daily Show

   Hey, it's Free Mango Night! The way it works is, everybody gives me
   free mangoes tonight! Yaaay! Your west coast-friendly edition of Cheers
   and Jeers starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!]

   Cheers and Jeers for Friday, July 12, 2013

   Note: I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have, in fact,
   caught and killed [29]a large predator that supposedly injured some
   bathers.  But, as you see, it's a beautiful day, the beaches are open
   and people are having a wonderful time.  Amity, as you know, means
   "friendship!"
   ---Mayor Vaughn

   CHEERSand JEERS to money matters.  I'll leave the detail parsing to the
   detail parsers (true fact: they have a secret handshake), but here's a
   handful of business headlines we stumbled on this week that might give
   us a sense of where things stand in the United States of Austerity:
   Monkeys: Speak, hear, see no evil
   How the GOP greeted news
   of the huge June surplus.
   -

     Borrowing shows consumer confidence
     Regulators to seek tighter rules on eight of America's largest banks
     Weekly Jobless claims jump to two-month high
     Producer prices rise, give positive economic signal
     Gas prices seen rising sharply within days
     Rate on 30-year mortgage hits two-year high
     Consumer sentiment climbs for fourth week in a row
     Record-breaking day for stocks sparked by upbeat Fed comments
     Global PC market shrank 11 percent in second quarter

   And this one from Reuters is worth a special solo shoutout:
   [32]"Surprise! Huge US budget surplus shatters record."  I'd tell you
   what the Republican deficit hawks think of that, but they've already
   retired to their coffins for the night.

   JEERS to whistleblower groundhog day.  NSA contract employee Edward
   Snowden [33]emerged from his hiding place at Moscow International
   Airport today and saw his shadow as he applied for temporary asylum in
   Russia.  That means at least six more weeks of media focus on Edward
   Snowden instead of on the shadow government inside the NSA.  And
   borscht cakes for everyone!

   CHEERS to a man who knew his way around a one-room cabin in the woods.
   Happy birthday to [34]Henry David Thoreau, born 196 years ago on July
   12, 1817.  He told the world to "Simplify! Simplify!"  And his writings
   on civil disobedience (the peaceful kind, not that right-wing "Second
   Amendment Remedies" crap) influenced many, including Martin Luther
   King, Jr., who wrote in his autobiography:
   Henry David Thoreau with quote
   In my imagination I'm a pole dancer.
   -

     I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral
     obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been
     more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry
     David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we
     are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of
     Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are
     more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch
     counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in
     Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are
     outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and
     that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.

   By the way, if you're looking to buy the perfect housewarming gift for
   a Walden lover, trust me: you can't go wrong with a Thoreau rug.

   JEERS to losing one of America's great contortioneers.  The
   [35]inventor of Twister has died.   Chuck Foley was 82:
   Cover of the game Twister.
   Notice all the "gents"
   are wearing neckties.
   -

     Foley and a collaborator, Neil Rabens, were hired in the mid-1960s
     by a St. Paul manufacturing firm that wanted to expand into games
     and toys. They came up with a game to be played on a mat on the
     floor, using a spinner to direct players to place their hands and
     feet on different colored circles.

     "Dad wanted to make a game that could light up a party," Mark Foley
     said. "They originally called it 'Pretzel.' But they sold it to
     Milton Bradley, which came up with the 'Twister' name." The game
     became a sensation after Johnny Carson and Eva Gabor played it on
     "The Tonight Show" in 1966.

   He'll be buried with his right foot on green and his left foot on blue.
   2013 Euro Pride Bastille Day poster
   My my my... Whatever they're

   CHEERS to getting mad as hell and not taking it anymore.  Sacre Bleu!
   Sunday is [36]Bastille Day, commemorating the important lesson the
   French learned 224 years ago, but which we Americans still haven't: it
   is better for the government to fear the people than it is for the
   people to fear the government.  Thus the French get a couple months of
   vacation, shorter work hours, universal health care, sick time, and a
   fresh beret every three months.  We, on the other hand, get to work
   ourselves to the bone for zero vacation days, zero sick time, and the
   honor of having to defend anti-poverty, anti-sickness,
   anti-getting-screwed-by-rich-people programs that are perpetually "on
   the table" for cuts---please try to contain your enthusiasm.  Sunday
   morning you'll find me propping a ladder up to our neighbor's bedroom
   window, storming in, grabbing a pair of their underwear and sending it
   up the flagpole.  Because we refuse to break our usual daily routine
   just because it's Bastille Day.
   Pister for the documentary Out on DVD.
   CHEERS to home vegetation.  Gonna be a hot, humid weekend 'round these
   parts (we're guessing the same applies in your parts too---sorry, that
   sounded dirty), and since the AC unit is next to the TV,
   well...resistance is futile.  On HBO's [37]Real Time, Bill Maher talks
   with Bobby Ghosh, Mike Rowe, Cornel West, Liz Mair and Matt Lewis.  New
   DVD releases include a timely documentary called [38]The Gatekeepers
   and girls gone wild with James Franco in Spring Breakers.  The baseball
   schedule [39]is here. (The Red Sox will flabbify the Athletics.)  The
   Senior U.S. Open golf tourney---which I like to watch because the
   roster is basically made up of legends---[40]continues with the final
   two rounds.  And Sunday night is the Season Two premiere of Aaron
   Sorkin's engaging, if overly preachy, [41]The Newsroom.  I watch it
   because Jeff Daniels Jeff Daniels Jeff Daniels and Jeff Daniels.

   On [42]Bill Moyers & Company, media scholar Marty Kaplan talks about
   how and why the traditional media goes out of its way to mask
   inequality in American via weapons of mass distraction.  And speaking
   of that, here's your Sunday morning lineup:

     Meet the Press: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid threatens to go
     nuclear on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell after McConnell
     reneges at the last second on a handshake deal to share a Twix bar.
      Reid, of course, fails to make good on his threat, but agrees to
     replace his chair on the set with a cardboard box at McConnell's
     insistence.  Plus: Congressman Tom Cotton (R-AR) gets to yakety yak
     about the evil brown people from Mexico without any Democrat to
     respond.

   Gopasaur
   Still the rulers of
   Sun. morning TV.
   -

     This Week: If you want to see Democratic Congresswoman Karen Bass
     (CA), you're gonna have to put up with Republican
     Congressobstructors Michele Bachmann (MN), Tom Cole (OK) and Mario
     Diaz-Balart (FL)...and right-wing Wall Street Journal water-carrier
     Paul Gigot.  Hooray for balance!

     Face the Nation: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyoohoo; plus
     three Republican House members---Peter King (NY), Mike Kelly (PA)
     and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (FL); Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) does
     that Durbin thing he does.

     CNN's State of the Union: Texas Governor Rick Perry openly wonders
     why someone would let a chick host her own Sunday morning TV news
     show.  It takes him several minutes to unstick Candy Crowley's
     brooch from his uvula while Illinois Governor Pat Quinn (D) points
     and laughs.  Plus: Reps. Chaka Fattah (D-PA and House Black Caucus)
     and Raul Grijalva (D-AZ and House Hispanic Caucus); NAACP head Ben
     Jealous talks about the George Zimmerman trial.

     Fox GOP Talking Points Sunday: Reps. Steve King (R-IA), Michael
     McCaul (R-TX) and Steve Israel (D-NY).

   Looking purely at the House members represented on the above shows,
   you'll see 9 Republicans and 4 Democrats, 11 of them men and 2 of them
   women.  Happy Slanted Viewing, guys!

   Five years ago in C&J: July 12, 2008

   JEERS to Deputy Droopydrawers.  Flint, Michigan police chief David
   Dicks (yep, that's his name)---apparently having nothing better to do
   in one of the most violent cities in America---has his super troopers
   using [43]this handy chart to check citizens out for excessive asscrack
   exposure:
   Graphic displaying Flint, Michigan PD's rules for baggy pants.
   &nbsp;From 2008.
   The maximum penalty is a year in jail.  Which I guess explains the
   sudden disappearance of all the city's plumbers.

   -

   And just one more...

   HA HA!!! to worthless predictions that become more worthless by the
   year. According to this highly-influential right-wing journalist, you
   and I have been stranded in the virtual desert for the last seven years
   and [44]Daily Kos is just a mirage:

     IS THE DAILY KOS ABOUT TO IMPLODE?

     July 12, 2006

   Markos Moulitsas on Meet the Press
   Not even the sight of Kos in
   a suit and tie could sink us.
   -

     It appears that the post-Yearly Kos month from hell is continuing
     for Markos Moulitsas Zuniga, the proprietor of the Internet's
     premier liberal blog Daily Kos. After receiving some extremely
     negative press from major publications such as The New York Times,
     The New Republic and Newsweek immediately following his seemingly
     successful bloggers' convention in Las Vegas, Kos is now faced with
     an even greater challenge: dissension within his ranks.

     Such internal squabbling comes at the same time that many prominent
     Democrats seem to be privately expressing concern about the
     direction the "netroots"---the self-described Internet grassroots
     movement of liberal bloggers and their loyal followers---are taking
     the Party. This seemingly inconvenient planetary alignment is not
     only threatening the long-term viability of this crusade, but also
     is putting Kos in an uncomfortable position just as his notoriety is
     skyrocketing.

   Seven years, seven bigger-and-better Netroots Nation conventions, and
   dozens of election victories both big and small later, "The" Daily Kos
   continues to not implode.  We're on great terms with a large number of
   Democratic lawmakers (Elizabeth Warren! Kirsten Gillibrand! Bernie
   Sanders! Alan Grayson!), candidates, and movers and shakers inside the
   progressive universe.  We're up to over 900,000 registered Kossacks.
   (Source: [45]jotter, of course.)  Hell, we've even got hippies like Tom
   Tomorrow and Mark Fiore posting here, fer cryin' out loud.  Sure, our
   pie fights are the stuff of legend.  But imploding?  Please.  "The"
   Great Orange Satan lives, breathes and throbs.  And our prime directive
   remains the same: make Bill O'Reilly cry.

   Have an implosion-free weekend.  Floor's open...What are you cheering
   and jeering about today?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [59]Tagging tips - [60]Search For Tags - [61]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [62]Civil
   Rights, [63]Community, [64]Congress, [65]Culture, [66]Economy,
   [67]Education, [68]Elections, [69]Energy, [70]Environment, [71]Health
   Care, [72]International, [73]Labor, [74]Law, [75]Media, [76]Meta,
   [77]National Security, [78]Science, [79]Transportation, or [80]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([81]California, [82]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       ...... and finally, for a song of the week
       ..................................... actually, this is the story
       of the family of acoustic bassist [246]Charlie Haden who has
       performed avant-garde jazz, mainstream jazz, backed-up many a
       singer and performed left-wing music (even under threat of
       detention) - who returned to his roots in 2008 by recording a
       country/bluegrass album, reflecting the singing family he grew up
       in.
       What's more, his [247]four children - all accomplished indie
       rockers themselves - joined him in this recording as well. It's a
       cliché but Charlie Haden ...... has indeed come full-circle.
       Shenandoah, Iowa may not be the first place you associate with
       avant-garde jazz ...... but he was part of the Haden Family which
       sang at the Grand Ole Opry, toured with the Carter Family and
       performed at revival meetings and on the radio (Charlie first doing
       so at age 22 months). But after growing up in Missouri, he
       contracted a mild case of bulbar polio in his teens, which affected
       his vocal chords and ended his singing career though he played bass
       on the TV show [248]Ozark Jubilee hosted by country musician Red
       Foley.
       But upon hearing modern jazz legend [249]Charlie Parker - Haden
       decided at age 18 to turn down a scholarship to the Oberlin
       Conservatory, instead going to the Westlake College of Music in Los
       Angeles to study jazz. His father was less than happy, but his
       mother saw him off at the Greyhound bus station.
       He found work with saxophonist Art Pepper and pianist Paul Bley and
       then in 1957 he heard the avant-garde saxophonist [250]Ornette
       Coleman sit in with another band ... who was told to stop playing
       his free improvisation fairly quickly and left the club. But Haden
       thought "the whole room lit up for me; it was that brilliant" and
       located Coleman the next day. In 1959, they moved (along with
       trumpeter Don Cherry and drummer Billy Higgins) to New York and
       landed a recording contract.
       To say that albums such as [251]Change of the Century or [252]The
       Shape of Jazz to Come and [253]This is Our Music were "out there" -
       well, the reaction from across the music world was raucous. As the
       All-Music Guide's Scott Yanow wrote, opinions were divided whether
       Coleman was a genius or a fraud. But over the few years, they
       helped re-define modern jazz, with Haden's work on [254]Ramblin'
       and "Lonely Lady" borrowing from his country roots - in fact, the
       Englishman [255]Ian Dury said that his sone "Sex and Drugs and Rock
       & Roll" came from Charlie Haden's 'Ramblin' bass lines.
       Charlie Haden eventually formed his own [256]Liberation Music
       Orchestra - along with pianist Carla Bley - and this on-and-off
       band still continues to perform occasionally (I saw them at
       Dartmouth College just a few years back). They have performed works
       about the Spanish Civil War ([257]Ballad of the Fallen) plus
       Vietnam and apartheid.
       In 1971, after Haden's wife gave birth to triplet daughters, Haden
       agreed to join a tour with Ornette that had Portugal as its last
       stop. Charlie Haden had a dislike for the military dictatorship in
       power back then, and didn't want to perform there. But Coleman
       persisted, and Haden decided to dedicate [258]Song for Ché to the
       rebels fighting the Portuguese military dictatorship (in Angola,
       Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau) publicly on-stage.
       And while several young people applauded, he was detained by the
       Portuguese authorities in prison (despite the song being purely
       instrumental). Haden was freed only when Richard Nixon's cultural
       attaché (against their better wishes) decided getting Haden out was
       easier than having the music world embarrass the host nation
       (although he says the FBI later questioned him about it). Charlie
       Haden told Amy Goodman on [259]Democracy Now that years later -
       after the fall of the junta - he was invited back, receiving a warm
       welcome.
       Charlie Haden went on to perform with a number of top-notch
       musicians, and founded the [260]CalArts Jazz Program in Valencia,
       California. Since the mid-1980's, he has performed most often with
       his [261]Quartet West - a more mainstream jazz outfit with veteran
       saxophonist Ernie Watts (who has toured with the Rolling Stones).
       In more recent years, he performed on Abbey Lincoln's 1991 [262]You
       Gotta Pay the Band with Stan Getz - with the song [263]Summer
       Wishes, Winter Dreams becoming my favorite ballad of the decade. He
       also recorded with former Cream drummer [264]Ginger Baker on two
       jazz/rock albums (with Bill Frisell on guitar) in the mid-1990's.
       And after seeing banners in Europe with an inscription after the
       invasion of Iraq, Haden and the Liberation Orchestra recorded a
       world music album (as Haden is quick to point out, [265]all four
       Liberation Music Orchestra recordings were made under Republican
       administrations). The title was a common theme on this site:
       [266]Not in Our Name - with versions of "America the Beautiful",
       the African National Congress anthem "Lift Every Voice and Sing"
       and the song "This is Not America" - written by the unlikely
       songwriting team of Pat Metheny and ... David Bowie.
       Yet it wouldn't be accurate to say that his 2008 family album was
       his first foray into his roots. In 1997, along with long-time
       guitarist friend Pat Metheny, they recorded the Americana-flavored
       duo album [267]Beyond the Missouri Sky - Metheny being a native,
       and Haden having come-of-age there - that brought Charlie Haden a
       Grammy Award.
       Along the way, Haden and his wife Ruth Cameron raised their four
       children. His son Josh (last photo) fronts an indie-rock band
       [268]Spain, and his three triplet daughters (Tanya, Rachel and
       Petra, second photo L-to-R) are also musicians.
       Tanya is a cellist and is married to the actor Jack Black. Rachel
       is a pianist who performed in the 1990's band [269]That Dog along
       with sister Petra. And violinist Petra has already made her mark in
       music with a 2005 a capella version of a landmark album by The Who:
       [270]Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out earned praise from
       [271]Pete Townshend himself: "I felt like I'd received something
       better than a Grammy".
       Over the past three years, Charlie has recorded a [272]number of
       albums - one of which was with his Quartet West entitled
       [273]Sophisticated Ladies featuring several female guest vocalists
       ... one of which is the opera singer [274]Renée Fleming who began
       her career as a jazz singer and has recently revisited the genre.
       Charlie Haden will turn age 72 next month, was named as a [275]NEA
       Jazz Master in 2012 and just this past February: received a Grammy
       [276]Lifetime Achievement Award. He is not on tour presently, but
       whatever music he's making (and with whomever): see him if he plays
       in your town.

                       [279][JH111111_zpsaaaa43ce.jpg]
       [280]Mark Fain (the bassist for Ricky Skaggs) told Charlie Haden
       that - if he ever wanted to make a country/bluegrass album - to
       please do so at Ricky's studio in Nashville. Well, in 2008 he did:
       with [281]Rambling Boy the result, and with his four children
       assisting.
       It has an all-star cast: Bruce Hornsby, Roseann Cash, Vince Gill,
       Elvis Costello, Jerry Douglas on dobro, Béla Fleck on banjo and, of
       course, Ricky Skaggs. The album is a treasure trove of Americana,
       country and bluegrass: [282]at this link you can watch a short
       video on the making of the album. Charlie's voice is still weak,
       but he closes the album singing [283]O Shenandoah as a
       labor-of-love.
       My favorite is one that Charlie Haden wrote as an instrumental:
       "Spiritual" which he played on albums with both Ginger Baker as
       well as Pat Metheny. His son Josh wrote lyrics for it (which Johnny
       Cash performed). And [284]at this link you can hear the family
       perform it live.

     Jesus, I don't want to die alone
     Jesus, oh Jesus, I don't want to die alone
     My love wasn't true
     Now all I have is you
     Jesus, oh Jesus, I don't want to die alone

     Jesus, if you hear my last breath
     Don't leave me here
     Left to die a lonely death
     I know I have sinned
     But Lord I'm suffering
     Jesus, oh Jesus, if you hear
     My last breath
     All my troubles
     All my pain
     Will leave me
     Once again
     Once again

   Do you want a private date night.... or a public date night?

   I recommend a private date night.  Indoor picnic.  Bubble bath.  Close
   the curtains and make yourselves nude (or do the sexy lingerie thing).
    Nibble crackers and fruits and whatever little finger foods you can
   make quickly.  Turn the TV off and put on sexy, romantic music - unless
   there's a sweet, romantic movie you have been saving to watch with your
   sweetie....

   Then get naked and... use your imagination....

       ... you'd be utterly amazed that it's me now....
       I have a sensually sweet radio dispatcher and PR voice that could
       send a man running for insulin after the first three syllables if
       he doesn't trip over his feet while taking off his pants and
       heading for the nearest place to recline.
       Sometime back in the late '60s/early '70s, the state police captain
       of another district whom I'd not met before a large meeting took
       place in my district walked in the office one day after radioing
       ahead his ETA since he was almost late, said in an astonishingly
       stern voice:  "Was that you on the radio?"  I looked at him with
       wide-eyed innocence and softly answered:  "Yes."  "I damn near
       drove off the road listening to your voice!!!  Damn your voice is
       sexy!!!"
       I blushed.  It was not, however, the first time I'd gotten such a
       nice compliment on my radio voice.  Unbeknownst to me when I first
       started years before that, I had a naturally good voice for radio
       and I only got better with time and training and I knew by then
       that it was very, very sexy and when I wasn't all officious during
       an emergency when there was no nonsense, I exploited that naturally
       husky sexiness to the max.  (Oh, BTW, my hobby during those years
       was theatre.  ;-))
       ;-D  I'm politely saying Elliot Spitzer would have dropped his
       drawers for me, sight unseen.
       Heh. ;-D  I still have the voice even though I'm a senior citizen.
        Not the looks, but the voice, yes.

       Good God, according to the NYTs et. al. this blog is totally
       destroyed right about now - - just 30 or so grouchy bloggers
       talking to themselves.
       We sure as hell do a good job of disguising it- especially all
       those politicians. I am, quite frankly, running out of things Sen.
       Gilibrand "would say" if she were a male 40ish blogger in the Pac
       NW!
       Frankly - the 2006 stuff sounds like wishful thinking from
       vulnerable also rans.

   It's been a rough week, having to part with our Heidi girl so soon
   after losing Senor "Ricky" Ricardo. Going to start prowling the Pet
   Adoption stations this weekend to find a new companion for our lonely
   boy, Toby the Yorki-Poo.

   Anyways, tonight we're going to crack open a fresh box of wine, kick
   back and watch a couple more episodes of Game of Thrones. The last one
   we watched had some disturbing scenes that caused me to rush out of the
   room and write a scathingly mean email, but Mr. C assured me that a
   stunt Direwolf was used, and no actual Direwolves were harmed in the
   making of the series.

   I also didn't like the way they picked up the Direwolf pups by their
   scruffs, but I did enjoy the scene where the big Direwolf protected
   Bran from the would-be assassin.

   Go Direwolves!!! Take no shit from anyone, not even the King, or that
   snotty ass prince!!!

   Love ya'll,
   CG

   PS May have to get me one of them Direwolves.

   But one cannot be too slutty, because slutty is in the eye of the

   while I know that we have our tiffs (and more!) here-- boy does the pie
   fly some days...

   I think that it is important to note that this place works and is
   vibrant because we have disagreements-- we don't march in lockstep.

   We are also a community...DailyKos is bigger than any one of us, but it
   is awesome because each of us participates!

       I must agree with you about that "separated at birth" deal.  George
       Clooney is MUCH better looking than that Mark whoever-he-is.  Just
       no comparison.

   ... the [1801]best of his generation of stereo speaker designers.

     BOSTON (AP) -- Amar Bose, founder and chairman of the audio
     technology company Bose Corp., has died. He was 83.

     His death was announced Friday by the company's president, Bob
     Maresca, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Bose
     began his acoustics research and was on the faculty for more than 40
     years.

     Bose founded the company, based in the Boston suburb of Framingham,
     in 1964. It is known for making radios and noise-canceling
     headphones. Maresca said the company will remain privately held.

     In 2011, Bose gave MIT the majority of Bose Corp. stock in the form
     of non-voting shares whose dividends are used to support education
     and research. MIT does not participate in management or governance
     of Bose Corp.

   He taught the first courses in EE when I was there. He didn't tolerate
   any nonsense. He told us that if anyone ever hissed in a class (which
   was rampant at the time), he would stop the class unless the hisser
   walked out. Someone did, wouldn't fess up, so Dr. Bose walked out, and
   we had to make up the material on our own. Lesson well learned.

   He never took his company public because he didn't want to be subject
   to the short-term prejudices of Wall Street. His company is almost 50
   years old and leads its industry. Any question why? He finally put it
   in trust for the benefit of MIT, and it will probably keep rolling
   along.

   lawn care.  After going to the site MSU turff Management, I found that
   the best way to stop weeds in a lawn is to set the mower height at 3" .
   Both of my Neighbors have agreed to give this a try, bless them.

   Maybe We might start a movement. Hell NO We won't Mow, under 3"

   The worst that can happen is we all have to set on the group M bench.

   marked "French Vanilla" was three feet tall orange - dark, ugly orange
   - marigolds, which does not go well with my cream/pink/coral annual

   Hey there, friends!

   CHEERS to the return of pleasant weather to the Emerald City. Temps
   near 90 are not enjoyable here, even though we don't have anything like
   the humidity of the eastern 2/3 of the country.

   JEERS to unemployment. There don't appear to be many prospects around
   for someone whose experience is entirely academic/governmental.
   Especially if he has lots and lots of such experience.

   CHEERS to my sister's and BIL's return from their 3-week vacation in
   Italy and the Balkans. I wonder how long it will take before their 3000
   photos are distilled down to a reasonable slideshow.

   CHEERS (so far) to leaves rustling, birds chirping, canine toenails on
   wood floors, and more. All of which I've been hearing since I decided
   that my high-frequency hearing loss needed to be addressed. CHEERS as
   well to making sense of what friends say in crowded saloons!

   JEERS to the world beyond this idyllic cocoon I reside in.

   Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the
   fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first
   existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher

     We are in the midst of the Monsoon here in the normally Arid-zona.
   At just shy of 4900' in elevation we are getting thunderstorms along
   with a fair amount of rain.  This should setup a lush, by local
   standards, 'Second Spring'.  The other day there was a lightning strike
   in the grassy open areas to the south of us.  The resulting fire was
   being propelled by a strong ESE wind ahead of some huge thunderheads.
   Just as the firecrews arrived, some of the co-workers and friends of
   the 19 who perished on June, 30 2013, and deployed the hoses the sky
   opened up and extinguished the fire.  It was amazing, as soon as the
   fire began to pickup speed it was out and the downpour subsided into a
   steady rain.
   Very cool.

       HUMIDITY...for us is anything over 35%, of course it goes up during
       the storms, but it does drop back down after. This is considered
       oppressive by southwestern standards. Okay, we're high humidity
       challenged but remember it also drops around 5 to 10% for a good
       portion of the year. "But, it's a dry heat", is a Chamber of

       I don't miss those 90-90 days at all.
       My insect-memory is more of Japanese beetles, which could
       completely cover a rose bush (or other such) with their evil little
       selves. There were times when we'd take an old mayonnaise jar,
       splash in an ounce or two of gasoline, pick off the bugs, and drop
       them in the jar to die in the hydrocarbons (and the tetraethyl
       lead).
       You could literally pull off a whole quart of beetles. One time, I
       took the jar of dead bugs out to a sandy open lot, poured out the
       contents, and took a match to it (jumping out of the way as I did).
       As the flames heated them, those little suckers popped like
       popcorn!

   That 3.11" was on the ground in 90 minutes on Tuesday night. We're

       I've finalized design on an electrical generator meant for
       individual homes, one I've been working on since attending UMass
       Lowell for engineering with a concentration in magentics. It does
       nothing for transportation issues, but should greatly diminish
       centralized power distribution. I can't afford the $3K for even the
       student version, but need to draw it up.

   If any of you live in Arizona Phoenix area and like the French you
   might like to go to the Musical Instrument Museum. This weekend they
   are doing concerts on the 13th, and 14th. of French music.
   My cousin will be there to play music both days. In case you ever
   wanted to hear my cousin play French music.
   The museum will also be serving French food.

   [2948]http://www.dailykos.com/...
    Check it out and give it some love, please.  Good people deserve
   nothing less.

   Cheers to cooler weather.  We got some.  Me like.  Won't last.  I'll be
   kvetching about it again next week.

   Other than that, kids, I got nuthin'.  I am bone weary for some reason.
    It's been a weak. Hope yours was fine as frog fur, and your weekend
   even better.  Hug someone close.

   Cheers to all of us who love and are loved.  It's the only thing that
   matters; without it, nothing else does.

   smoochies, kids
   Marti

   If I get a female Direwolf, I'm going to name it "Marti." Or maybe
   "Princess Direwolf."

   the Hollywood sign- I worked on one of the most obscure
   Post-Apocolly/VidGame movies that were so hawt in the 2000's, and
   Cleveland was the location for Hollywood-After-the-Flood. The Canals
   were great, and we 1/2submerged the Sign, and The Marlboro Man, and the
   roof of Graumanns' Chinese Theater. To this day, that is all of the

   ... because any male who acts like a real human being with common sense
   and gives women the legal right to personal autonomy (however little
   that may be within the draconian misogynistic laws passed by creepy old
   men and Stepford women) deserves credit.  They're pretty rare in the

   however.  Can't wait to remove them about 1:45-ish tomorrow.  They'll

       I have a fatal attraction for smart men, and Jonathan Turley is one
       such man.  I fell in love with him explaining the constitutional
       no-nos of the Bushista regime on Keith Olbermann.  I wish Keith was
       back on TV if only to have Jonathan on more often.
       Luna is all sorts of adorableness....  :-)  I think the Turley

       I don't know if it's because I think they're so damned brainy that
       makes them more attractive...but it doesn't hurt.  They're both
       very easy on the eyes.  :-)
       Oddly enough, I was just thinking about Keith and the Professor the
       other day.  I miss having Jonathan explain constitutional law for
       me.  Even without Keith, I had hoped that someone (Rachel or Chris
       Hayes) would be savvy enough to have him on more often.
       Keith is coming back to tv...but not for us.  He's going to do some
       after baseball stuff on ESPN, I think.  I know that's his first
       love, but.....dammmm.  Here's a link to his Twitter feed, if you'd
       like to check it out:

       Some jackass on Facebook (why am I not surprised??) is using a pic

       But, back to the cute and four legged.....I think the Turley family
       are going to be very happy with their new Luna, and she with them!

   messages during that time, nothing yesterday. Today he placed a call to
   the person who interviewed him asking for the status of his
   application. Rather than call him back they emailed him with a message
   saying that the position had been "put on hold." Not very courageous of
   them.

   JEERS to going back to work. Trapper's off until Monday; I went back to
   work today. Couple of hundred emails in the inbox. Crisis here, fire
   there. Blah Blah Blah. I should have stayed away.

   JEERS to criminals with guns. See [3541]this diary by edrie about a
   shooting that took place early today in downtown SF which may have
   resulted in the death of at least one of her friends. And send her some
   love.

   Oh yeah...JEERS and some raspberries to the pathetic sore losers at
   "ProtectMarriage" who don't understand what the US Supreme Court told
   them two weeks ago: they're S.O.L. Keep your ears open for the sounds
   of laughter emanating from the California Supreme Court.

   At least the weekend's here and it's sunny and cool in SF (as per
   usual).

       If the job really is "on hold" as they say, maybe at some
       point---like, say, when Republicans get their thumbs out of their
       hineys and let the economy flourish---the job will get "un-held"
       and it'll go to him.  One can hope, anyway.

   Jeers to cancer. My wife's brother died last Sunday at 59, way too
   soon. He had finally met and married a wonderful woman about 11 years
   go, and they had a daughter, and now they're alone. Sigh. Then a few
   days later my boss's mother died of cancer.

   Cheers to vacations. Mine starts tonight, for two weeks, just
   vegetating by the shore of beautiful Lovejoy Pond in Readfield, Maine.

   Jeers to working like crazy to finish up everything before vacation.

   Cheers to Massdems. I'll be at the Massachusetts Democratic Convention
   in Lowell tomorrow. Look for the skinny guy in the snazzy aloha shirt.

   Jeers to craziness in Massachusetts. We've got stories going on Aaron
   Hernandez, Whitey Bulger, Djokhar Tsarnaev, the remains of Albert
   DeSalvo (aka The Boston Strangler), all at once. We'll let Florida have
   George Zimmerman.

   Cheers to Elizabeth Warren. I guess it helps to get bipartisan support
   for a bill, so I voted for her despite having to also mention The
   Grumpy Old Man, whose most famous line was "How about that Sarah Palin,
   heh? Heh?"

   proposing her as a Nobel Peace Prize nominee was a bit overwrought.
   (Mea culpa.).

   Today I focused on her for the first time and watched a couple chunks
   of her speech to the U.N.  Ooooh my Gawd!  She is extraordinary!  It
   was, for me, an amazing experience.   Judging by the reactions of those

   choice. Rachel Maddow for her take-down of VA Gov McDonnel and his
   wife, who took gifts from a CEO with business before the state, and
   failed to report these gifts on financial disclosure statements. It was
   the most epic take-down piece of a dirty politician I've ever seen. And
   this exposé by Rachel may have hastened the Gov's resignation in shame
   as a grand jury inquiry looms next week.

   so is it 2011 or 2012? Has KosWorld been transported back in time or am
   I delusional in thinking it's 2013? (The English wiki is nearly
   unintelligible but the French reads correctly.) If you ask your Homme

       Good thing.
       You're correct that it's been 224 years since the storming of the
       Bastille.
       Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the
       fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first
       existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the
       higher consideration. -- [DEL: K.Marx :DEL] A.Lincoln
