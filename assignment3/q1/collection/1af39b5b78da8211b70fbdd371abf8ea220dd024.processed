Marijuana, fights, guns: Zimmerman loses key pretrial battles

   By Josh Levs. Graham Winch and Victor Blackwell, CNN
   updated 6:40 AM EDT, Wed May 29, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Zimmerman's brother calls on the prosecution to drop the
       murder charge
     * NEW: A Martin family attorney calls this "a very important day in
       this case"
     * Some of the banned information may come up at trial if it's proven
       relevant
     * No delay; the trial will begin June 10, the judge rules

   Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- Trayvon Martin's familiarity with guns, his
   marijuana use, and fights he may have been in cannot be brought up in
   George Zimmerman's murder trial, the judge overseeing the case ruled
   Tuesday.

   At the hearing two weeks before the scheduled start of the trial, Judge
   Debra Nelson handed a series of victories to the prosecution when she
   barred the defense from introducing some information about Martin.

   Defense attorneys argued that some of the evidence could prove crucial
   in backing up Zimmerman's claim of self-defense, depending on what the
   prosecution argues.

   Certain evidence could ultimately be raised during the trial, however,
   if it is proven relevant and admissible based on what the prosecution
   presents, the judge decided.

   Zimmerman's attorneys say, paints a different picture of the
   17-year-old than the one portrayed by his family and supporters.

   Nelson left the door open on one issue involving marijuana. Defense
   attorneys say toxicology tests show Martin had enough THC -- the key
   active ingredient in marijuana -- in his system to indicate he may have
   smoked the drug a couple of hours before the shooting. Nelson barred
   any mention of this from opening statements but said she will rule
   later on whether it will be admissible after she hears defense experts'
   testimony about the marijuana use.

   Marijuana use in general can come up during jury selection, the judge
   said.

   The attorneys also cannot bring up Martin's text messages. The defense
   argued that texts from the day of the shooting [42]show the teen was
   "hostile." The judge also agreed to block previous text messages from
   Martin about drugs and a gun.

   Zimmerman, who is out on bail, did not appear at the hearing.

   He's charged with second-degree murder in the February 26, 2012,
   shooting. He was a neighborhood watch volunteer when he called 911
   reporting "a suspicious person" in the neighborhood, who turned out to
   be 17-year-old Martin.

   The shooting put a national spotlight on Zimmerman's hometown of
   Sanford, Florida, and sparked fresh debates about race relations and
   gun laws. The decision not to bring charges against Zimmerman led to
   the dismissal of the town's police chief and the appointment of a
   special prosecutor, who accused the homeowner of unjustly profiling and
   killing Martin.

   Defense: State didn't turn over some evidence

   Nelson did agree to one key request from the defense: to hold a hearing
   on whether the state failed to turn over some evidence.

   The defense called Wesley White, a former employee of the state
   attorney's office, who said the prosecution did not turn over certain
   photos -- including one of a firearm in someone's hand -- as well as
   some deleted text messages.

   Nelson agreed to subpoena the state IT investigator who allegedly
   issued a report about the photos and text messages. But she denied a
   defense request for a delay in the start of the trial, setting the
   start of jury selection for June 10.

   Nelson also granted the prosecution's motion to bar evidence about why
   it took so long to arrest Zimmerman.

   She denied a defense motion asking that the jury be taken to the crime
   scene and called it "disingenuous" in light of another defense motion
   requesting anonymity for the jury.

   The jurors will remain anonymous and will be referred to by their
   numbers only, she said.

   Nelson set a hearing for Friday on whether the media will be allowed to
   show their faces.

   [43]Gun, drug texts feature in new evidence

   Judge to rule on screaming heard in 911 calls

   Defense attorneys also raised questions Tuesday about an analysis that
   suggests Martin might be heard screaming in the background of a 911
   call just before the shooting.

   Voice identification experts hired by the prosecution say that [44]they
   don't know for certain whose voice it is and that there isn't enough
   sound to make a conclusive determination.

   One analyst, Alan Reich, said he believes Martin can be heard saying
   the word "stop."

   Reich [45]told the Washington Post that he believes the voice is
   Martin, but another analyst told the Post that no determination can be
   made.

   Defense attorneys said Tuesday that in a deposition on Friday, Reich
   said he had not completed his report and would need another two weeks.

   The defense does not want Reich's analysis admitted.

   Judge Nelson ruled that in a hearing at the end of next week, the
   science being used for voice identification will be discussed, and she
   will determine whether it is admissible at trial.

   If she approves the science as admissible, there's still another
   barrier for either side to present witnesses using that science. Once
   the trial begins, when either side wants to call a witness who
   conducted such an analysis, the judge will consider whether the
   scientist's qualifications give him or her adequate expertise to weigh
   in.

   [46]Zimmerman will not seek 'stand your ground' hearing

   No gold teeth

   While defense attorneys had argued in court papers that they may want
   other details about Martin admitted -- including an assertion that he
   had removable gold tooth caps -- they agreed Tuesday that they don't
   expect it to become relevant at trial.

   Nelson ruled there will be no such mention in the trial.

   Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's family, previously lashed out
   against the defense for trying to get such details admitted.

   "Is the defense trying to prove Trayvon deserved to be killed by George
   Zimmerman because (of) the way he looked?" Crump asked in a statement.
   "If so, this stereotypical and closed-minded thinking is the same
   mindset that caused George Zimmerman to get out of his car and pursue
   Trayvon, an unarmed kid who he didn't know."

   Zimmerman's brother: Drop murder charge

   After the hearing, Robert Zimmerman, brother of George, called on the
   state to drop the second-degree murder charge.

   "George lived in a community plagued by crime and was the first to come
   forward to help his neighbors," he said. "George is a good, decent and
   honest man. It is now my honor to advocate for him. George is in the
   fight of his life quite literally. As the oldest son, the only right
   thing for me to do is deliver him back to our parents. The only right
   way to do it is by relying on truth. We are not a wealthy family but we
   are rich in honor."

   Authorities initially "did their job when they refused to charge
   someone with a crime who had committed no crime," Robert Zimmerman
   said. "In this country, you don't charge someone with any crime solely
   to assuage the concerns of misinformed masses."

   Daryl Parks, another attorney for the Martin family, praised Tuesday's
   hearing.

   "Without question, today was a very important day in this case," he
   said.

   "What was rather clear: All of the bad information put out by the
   defense team will not be evidence in this case," Parks added.

   None of the information that was barred, he argued, "had anything to
   do" with the confrontation that led to Martin being killed.

   CNN's Victor Blackwell reported from Sanford, Florida; CNN's Josh Levs
   and Graham Winch reported from Atlanta. CNN's Jessica Thill and Rich
   Phillips contributed to this report.
