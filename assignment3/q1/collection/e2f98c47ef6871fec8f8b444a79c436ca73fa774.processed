[47]Michaela Pereira on her "New Day" team: "We each have each other's back"

   Before "New Day" starts Monday, you can find web videos featuring our
   show hosts and much more right here on NewDayCNN.com. In the latest in
   our "Before The New Day" series, Michaela Pereira talks about the "New
   Day" team - Chris Cuomo and Kate Bolduan.

   "I've learned that this is a brother from another mother," says
   Michaela of Chris. "He is a fantastic family man...highly intelligent,
   very passionate."

   Of Kate: "It's been a delight to see her outside the Washington
   political world." She also talked about the three as a team.

   "It's going to be great, because we each have each other's back," says
   Michaela.

   "New Day" starts Monday at 6 a.m. ET.

       I love New Day, but I must say it would be nice to see and hear
       Michaela Pereira a lot more. It is very difficult to listen to Kate
       Bolduan for a long period of time, she sounds like she is talking
       out of her nose and it sounds very nasally, it's too bad because I
       like Kate. Also, the weather girl, Indra Petersons, how annoying is
       she to listen to. Another one, who talks through her nose,very
       painful to listen to for a long period of time.
       I love the show, but after a while and constantly waiting to hear
       from Michaela Pereira, I just get bored and change the channel.
       Chris Cuomo, always love to hear you, very clear and engaging. Not
       so much with Kate. Michaela, I really hope that you are given a
       larger role in front of the camera. Thoroughly enjoy watching and
       listening to you, you have the power to engage anyone watching to
       listen to what is being reported.
       All the best!!

            Good Heavens Anna. How many backhanded "compliments" can you
            leave? I like the show very much the way it is and believe
            that the producers have done a terrific job in providing an
            alternative to the morning shows on the networks. You should
            consider making a video tape of yourself speaking &
            interacting with others and ask someone knowledgeable about
            broadcast production to critique it for you. You might be
            surprised with the sound of your voice too.

       Hi, Robert,
       Zoraida Sambolin is currently on medical leave, but will be
       returning to CNN after her recovery. John Berman is very much part
       of the Early Start program and New Day. We intend to keep them both
       very busy, so hope you'll stay tuned to CNN.
       CNN's newest meteorologist, Indra Petersons, is now part of the
       morning program as well. Jennifer Delgado is still part of CNN
       International; she fills in on occasion when other CNN Weather team
       members are on vacation.
       Thanks so much for watching and do let us know what you think of
       the show.

       What will happen to Zoraida and John Berman? What happened to
       Jennifer Delgado? Has she been permanetly replaced by this Ingra
       person?
