[24]CPAC 2013: Lions and tigers and communists, oh my

   The official theme of CPAC this year is America's Future: The Next
   Generation of Conservatives. A quick scan through the program, however,
   suggests a strong ancillary theme might be Our Yearly Homage to
   Pants-Crapping Terror. A seemingly endless list of available movie
   screenings and book signings mostly borrow from the latter; the books,
   especially, carry loud, insistent titles about imminent terror coming
   from an unending parade of conspirators. A sampling, with bolding to
   properly highlight the terror:
     * Obama's Four Horsemen: The Disasters Unleashed by Obama's
       Reelection!
     * Beating Obamacare: Your Handbook for Surviving the New Health Care
       Law!
     * The Communist: Frank Marshall Davis, The Untold Story of Barack
       Obama's Mentor!
     * Fast and Furious: Barack Obama's Bloodiest Scandal and Its
       Shameless Cover-Up!
     * At The Brink: Will Obama Push Us Over the Edge?!!!

   Those obviously all deal with the same terror, namely the currently
   sitting president. Other terrors are more inclusive, with lavishly
   thrilling subtitles like How Government Fat Cats Are Getting Rich Off
   of You or Will Americans Rule Themselves or be Ruled by Others?

   The panels are considerably tamer sounding in comparison, but certainly
   with exceptions, as with a Charles Murray-led effort titled Is America
   Coming Apart?, and God help us all on that one. Panels are devoted to
   Fatherless America and Hollywood, and Iran because that goes without
   saying. A business-oriented outing asks Has Atlas Shrugged? (The answer
   on that last one would be no, and please stop asking; a perceived
   crisis involving whether or not America's most wealth-obsessed titans
   of unspecified industry will someday just find it all too sad and
   burdensome to go out and make even more money is quite possibly the
   most maudlin thing I have ever heard.) A crackpot-heavy panel on The
   United Nations vs. The United States sounds like a spectacular effort
   in the making; if you are the betting type, that would seem a fine one
   for quickly going off the rails and into a muddy ditch somewhere.

   I keep saying it, over and over: I have no idea how conservatives do
   it. The sheer number of things that require absolute panic--the
   fast-moving, rock-strewn river of things that are about to cause the
   imminent destruction of America or of the Good Conservatives within it,
   is uncountable, and the effort it must take is enormous. Conservative
   dogma requires multiple exclamation points of alarm over the United
   Nations, all of government, Democrats, liberals, communists, atheists,
   Muslims, insufficiently Christian Christians, Christians of dubious
   sects, the media, Hollywood, Obamacare, brown people, immigrants, sex,
   homosexuals, uppity women, all of Europe (both as entity and as
   abstract concept), everywhere that is not Europe, climate scientists,
   biologists, environmentalists, economists, college professors,
   bilingual people, urban dwellers, campaign finance advocates, community
   organizers, several American cities and certain unpleasant history
   books.

   No wonder people like Wayne LaPierre imagine that an American collapse
   and dystopia is just around the corner; all of modern civilization is
   apparently etherial, or ephemeral, or a cruel plot. We are always one
   health insurance law away from government-sponsored camps, or one
   overly-tanned immigrant away from genetic or cultural Armageddon.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [43]Tagging tips - [44]Search For Tags - [45]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [46]Civil
   Rights, [47]Community, [48]Congress, [49]Culture, [50]Economy,
   [51]Education, [52]Elections, [53]Energy, [54]Environment, [55]Health
   Care, [56]International, [57]Labor, [58]Law, [59]Media, [60]Meta,
   [61]National Security, [62]Science, [63]Transportation, or [64]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([65]California, [66]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Similar concept dating back to 2009 ([198]0+ / 0-)
       Actually, Hunter's Daily Kos rant isn't entirely original in
       concept either (though I do not accuse Hunter of plagiarism).
       Over the past several years (dating back to at least 2009 if not
       before), several posters on FARK.com have been maintaining the
       [199]"List Of People  Conspiring  Against  The  GOP   (And  Thus
       America)" (or "LOPCATGOPATA").
       ^| This link goes to a relatively recent edition thereof, from
       December, 2012, which itself includes clickable links to most of
       the items listed (read the comments after it in the thread for
       still more links). Each such link goes to an article or FARK thread
       on an article backing up why the GOP would consider the person (or
       group) named to be conspiring against them.
       Since then, some additional entries include Goldman Sachs and Rand
       Paul, again with links.

   A wakeup call for me back in 2003 was seeing a frig-magnet at CPAC,
   which showed the World Trade Center on 9/11/01 engulfed in flames, as
   the jet exploded, superimposed with the words: "Clinton's Legacy."
   (Never mind that Bush had been in power for 9 months, had been warned
   that 'OBL was determined to attack in the US,' had ignored Richard
   Clarke's warnings and removed him from Cabinet access, etc.) If they
   were willing to openly use that national tragedy for partisan gain,
   then it was clear nothing was off-limits for them. Nothing.

   It's sad that terror is still the best gimmick they can come up with to
   sell their policies. It's also a reminder for us, that although we also
   see lots of problems, we continue to focus on and push for positive
   solutions to them.

   Thanks for being there, Hunter! (Please post some pics of the craziness
   in the booths, if you can -- it's hard to convey how mind-numbing it
   is, using just words.)

     fast-moving, rock-strewn river of things that are about to cause the
     imminent destruction of America or of the Good Conservatives within
     it, is uncountable, and the effort it must take is enormous.

   The modern conservative movement is built around fear, anger, and
   greed. It sells the myth of personal independence in success while
   ignoring the benefits of privilege and society. These are exceptionally
   shallow and self-centered people who are desperate to define in-group
   tribal boundaries and wage war on anyone outside the tribe or not
   believing their tribal creeds.

       The most conservative part of the US is the part largely settled by
       the Scots-Irish, large numbers of whom were herdsmen. As their
       wealth was very portable, it was easily stolen and so they became
       clannish, hyper-vigilant, judgmental, and easily roused to
       violence.  That culture was then imported to the upland south where
       they settled in the New World. It may be a just-so story, but it
       does seem to answer some cultural questions.

       After all the fear mongering the idiot republicans have done over
       communism, one would think they'd be violently opposed to having
       anything to do with China, but their corporate masters can't have
       that! So the conservatives have been conditioned to back China
       without question. Cries of "communist" are now reserved for our
       democratically elected president. I guess the actual "communists"
       are considered "free trade" partners and "job creators" by the
       conservatives now...

   CPAC is having a video [726]You Tube contest

   Unfortunately, the deadline has passed to submit a video on the topic
   of "The Future of the Conservative Movement: Timeless Principles, New
   Challenges" for cash prizes, but I suppose one could still upload a
   video to You Tube.

   I hope this guy wins. He has a flag, mentions core values, and says
   Reagan all in :60 seconds- all while wearing either a gigantic cowboy
   hat or a freakishly small head.
