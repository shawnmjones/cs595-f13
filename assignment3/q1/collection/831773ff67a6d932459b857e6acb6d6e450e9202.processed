[24]Meet the two weenie Democrats who are cool with violence against
not-straight, not-white women

   two hot dogs in buns
   Reps. Lipinski and McIntyre
   First, the good news. The House finally--finally--[30]reauthorized the
   Violence Against Women Act. Hooray! And it's the bipartisan version
   from the Senate, the one the president has promised to sign, the one
   that includes protection for all women, not just straight white ladies.
   Hooray some more!

   Now here's the bad news: We have a turncoat in our midst. [31]Two of
   them, in fact: Reps. Mike McIntyre and Dan Lipinski. Now, McIntyre
   [32]hails from the very red 7th district in North Carolina, where
   President Obama won a whopping 39.9 percent of the vote. He's a bad
   guy, to be sure, but you can't expect much from a Democrat in a
   district that red. Heck, you have to wonder how he managed to win the
   seat at all.

   But Lipinski? Lipinski cast his Republicanesque vote from the comfort
   of his nice, safe blue 3rd Congressional District in Illinois, where
   the president won 55.9 percent of the vote in 2012, and where Lipinski
   has no excuse for voting with Republicans except that he's a son of a
   bitch who likes voting with Republicans. Especially when it comes to
   their War on Women. He's had a [33]zero percent rating from NARAL for
   most of his career in Congress, though he somehow managed to improve
   that by a whole 10 points in 2011. He voted against the Affordable Care
   Act. He's [34]voted repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood. Basically,
   he's not a fan of women, their health care, or the programs that help
   combat violence against them. So he's a great soldier in the War on
   Women--for the Republicans.

   These two turncoats did [35]ultimately vote for the final version of
   the bill, so they each get an eighth of a point for that (to be shared
   between them). But then, 87 Republicans managed to suck it up and vote
   for the final version too, which makes Lipinski and McIntyre as good
   as, well, those Republicans.

   McIntyre may be untouchable in his district, but Lipinski? He has no
   excuse. If he's so devoted to helping Republicans fight their War on
   Women, he has no business holding that seat. It's time to kick him to
   the curb and make sure this session of Congress is his last.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [59]Civil
   Rights, [60]Community, [61]Congress, [62]Culture, [63]Economy,
   [64]Education, [65]Elections, [66]Energy, [67]Environment, [68]Health
   Care, [69]International, [70]Labor, [71]Law, [72]Media, [73]Meta,
   [74]National Security, [75]Science, [76]Transportation, or [77]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([78]California, [79]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       As I recall, the Daily Kos community backed another candidate in
       the primary with lots of money and volunteers. The candidate failed
       miserably.
       You have to understand that Lipinki's district is Democrat in name
       only.. it's "machine democrat" - which means everyone understands
       that if you vote Dem your garbage gets picked up and you've got
       someone to call night or day to fix any little problems in the
       neighborhood.  Loyal Dem voters, but not progressive in the least.
       His district also holds some of the neighborhoods where white
       Chicago workers reside in the far west and southwest parts of the
       city.  Once again.. loyal Dem voters, but extremely conservative in
       some respects.. some being downright racist.

       who is a republican. I called earlier and strongly urged his staff
       to ask him to support final passage of the Senate bill, and he
       clearly listened to those of us who lobbied him this way.
       I suggest all of us who live in republican districts, where our
       representatives voted for passage of the Senate version, that we
       let our representatives know we appreciate that final vote.
       Let them know we're out here. That we're watching. That they can
       moderate their views.
       We don't have to tell them that we won't vote for them, but we can
       make the process more civil, and more open for compromise or
       negotiation when it's clearly necessary.

       if the women living there are fans of Ann Coulter and Michelle
       Malkin, then no, it would not resonate with them in the least.
       Plus, as stated above, you have a lot of white Chicago workers as
       well who may harbor racist feelings.  For them, Lipinski did vote
       for the version that protects basically only straight white
       females, so they're probably OK with how it didn't include
       protections for "teh gay".

   Everything about him screams "waste of oxygen".  It would almost be
   worth having a Republican for two years in his seat, just to get rid of
   him.  But his seat is safe, and he will be re-elected.

   The only hope of getting rid of him is to appoint him ambassador to the
   Vatican (he's a blindly obedient conservative Catholic), or engaging
   him in some kind of a scandal.

   There's really nothing positive to say about Lipinski.  It's probably a
   waste of money trying to back a primary challenger, but it's definitely
   worth it for anyone who has the means to keep a close eye on him and
   exploit any kind of scandal or weakness.

   I volunteered for The Lip's primary opponent, Mark Pera, and I can tell
   you Bon Temps' comment is dead on. Pera had the backing of progressive
   groups and he finished third behind a ringer in the race.

   Dan Lipinski only holds this seat because his father bequeathed it to
   him, himself resigning from Congress timed so that the Committeepeople
   would name his replacement rather than have an open election. Daddy Tom
   made it known he wanted to see his son Dan in the seat.

   I would love to see Lipinski primaried, but this would not be a first
   tier opportunity.

       You can't Primary this guy with anyone to the left, because he

       Even "Red" Dems count when the leadership, and committee chairs are

       We do need to purge the DINOs, but not until we have a decent

   Despite all the hatred heaped upon NC DINOs like Heath Shuler and Larry
   Kissell, there's no doubt how their Teabagger replacements will vote.
   The same is true if McIntire was primaried and lost.

   Heck, NC has 2 female Republians - Foxx & Ellmers - and even they voted

 Yes... that's how it is done ([427]0+ / 0-)
       t'aint right... but that is how it gets done.
       And it's not just father to son or Demcorats. In my county in
       upstate New York the Republicans did this regularly with the D.A.'s
       office. There was a long time DA that they got elected for the last
       time. Then he retired before the next election so that they could
       appoint someone to replace him who would then run as the
       "incumbent." When he later moved out of the office they did the
       same thing. I think they ran through 4 occupants of the office this
       way (one of whom was the son of the local State Senator) before
       they finally appointed one so incompetent that Democrats won they
       office from them. But even that one they got the out going
       Republican governor to create a new county judgeship for her so
       that they could shove her upstairs and hope to retain the DA's
       office. In a special we beat her for the judgeship and then won the
       DA's office in the next regular election.
       By saying it's not "questionable" I'm just saying that sort of
       thing is standard operating procedure for machine politics and not
       surprising at all.

     Abortion
     Lipinski is pro-life[4] and serves as co-chair of the bipartisan
     Congressional Pro-Life Caucus.[5]

     Lipinski is a co-sponsor of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion
     Act.[6]

     [edit]LGBT issues
     On April 29, 2009 Lipinski voted for the Hate Crimes Expansion bill
     which expands the definition of hate crimes and strengthens
     enforcement of hate crime laws.[7] On May 27, 2010, Lipinski voted
     against repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy.[citation needed] In
     December 2010 he voted in favor of repeal.[8] Lipinski opposes
     recognition of same-sex marriage.[9]

   [edit]

     Healthcare and abortion
     Lipinski was the only Illinois Democrat to oppose the Patient
     Protection and Affordable Care Act, which passed the House on March
     21, 2010.[15] He said that he broke ranks with his party for a
     number of reasons, including the bill's provisions related to
     abortion.[16] Lipinski had previously voted for a version of the
     bill that contained more stringent restrictions on abortion
     funding.[17]

   With no allegiance to either of these jamokes, does calling for their
   ouster smack a bit of the Tea Party approach to purging the
   ideologically impure?

   While this case might be justified, we have to be careful not to slip
   into the ways of the right-wing.  Pushing the Ds to the left might be
   the goal, but the pace of the movement is important too lest we become
   a mirror-image fringe.

       If you don't adopt the ways of the "Republicans" Democrats are
       doomed to be a party that just barely hangs onto power and loses it
       every once in a while.  Trust me, I'm a former Republican.
       Unfortunately, the House Democratic leadership has never made
       anti-choice pukes pay the way "Republican" leadership does.  They
       put pro-chyoice folks on terrible committees, never give them
       chairmanships of anything but a small unimportant sub-committee and
       on and on and on.  If the Democrats don't start doing this we'll
       continue to have to fight battles against these idiots who now run
       the US House of Representatives.
       And further more, this is exactly why I'm not a Democrat.  I vote
       almost a straight Democratic ticket in Colorado as one of hundreds
       of thousands of used to be Republicans.  But I won't be a Democrat
       until they learn the lesson and start fighting like lives depenede
       on it, because they do.  I just don't believe that there are enough
       Democrats that are willing to get down in the mud and expose these
       idiots for what they actually believe which is so far out of the
       mainstream of American life.

   He got in because his Dad had the district for years. He was actually
   teaching in Tennessee when his Dad gave him the seat.

   I forget most of the details now, but he was almost primaried out as a
   Freshman but I guess some of his supporters ran a "progressive" to
   split the progressive vote.

   of his centrist, DINO daddums, but considering how my 120 lb Great Pyre
   just pissed on the shadow, I suspect that that comparison is now all
   wet. (not to mention our snowy conditions in Chi-Town).

   What is remarkable is the difference between Limp-inski and our new
   wonderwoman, Rep-Elect Kelly. One is smart, insightful, the other acts
   as though too many bibles were bashed upside his head in his yute. One
   holds great promise, the other promises to hold onto office because no
   other job opportunities are available for someone that dense and
   closed-minded, unless the local Mac is hiring. One presents and ignites
   the excitement and expectation of new and fresh ideas within DC, the
   other resents and ignores any ideas which conflict with his incredibly
   small, biased, and lump of gray matter that mostly plays possum.

   Black holes have expressed their jealousy of Limp-inski. Black holes
   collect everything in their path because their huge gravitational
   forces overwhelm inertia and mass of everything. In his case, no matter
   how much proof or fact you throw at him, he remains immune to any
   growth, or rational reaction. He's like the anti-black hole. No data or
   new information sticks to him.

   Lipinski is a total and complete DINO, when he isn't busy being a total
   and complete asshole.  He's as DINO as they come.  And the area he reps
   is not quite exactly what folks here at DKos would consider
   liberal/progressive...shorthand:  the area is full of South side Irish
   types that made good and got the hell out of the South side; lot of
   Italians too...though Lipinski is far more conservative than his
   district.

   If you know Chicago, then you know what I'm talking about^^

   Lipinski has never ever, never ever been even close to supportive of
   dem. ideology where women are concerned.  The ONLY way he manages to
   win election is to run as a democrat...then he votes like a Repuke.

 you will never get rid of Lipinsky... ([642]0+ / 0-)

   ..until you break the nepotistic Chicago Democratic party.  Lipinski is
   from Tennessee but his father, Bill, is a long time Chicago politician,
   the bad kind that make it hard for suburban Democrats get anyone
   elected.

   His father wanted to hand the seat to his son so he ran, and won the
   primary, then dropped out and had the party replace him with his son.
   People say Chicago is a great Democratic city but it is dysfunctional
   and we get the types of Lipinski and Emanuel.  Even Jan Shakowski's,
   who I adore, husband was involved in financial wrongdoings.

   From Wiki.

     Lipinski was born July 15, 1966. Prior to his election to Congress,
     Lipinski served as a Professor at the University of Tennessee from
     2001 to 2004. From 2000 to 2001, he served as a Professor at the
     University of Notre Dame. He has served as an aide to four members
     of Congress including, George Sangmeister from 1993 to 1994, Jerry
     Costello from 1995 to 1996, and Rod Blagojevich from 1999 to 2000.
     In addition, he served as an aide to then-House Minority Leader Dick
     Gephardt. Lipinski was elected on roughly the same platform as his
     father, promising to be a fairly conservative Democrat while
     fighting for government support for the district.

   He is also Catholic so that might also account for his anti-women
   stance.

   We Glory in war, in the shedding of human blood. What fools we are.
