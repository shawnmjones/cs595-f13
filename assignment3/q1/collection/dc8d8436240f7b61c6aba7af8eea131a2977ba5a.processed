   Measuring Progress
   [ch1cover.jpg]

   Setting clear goals and finding measures that will mark progress toward
   them can improve the human condition.
   [1-2.jpg]
   [1-3.jpg]
   [1-4.jpg]
   [1-5.jpg]

   We can learn a lot about improving the world in the 21st century from
   an icon of the industrial era: the steam engine.

   Over the holidays I read The Most Powerful Idea in the World, a
   brilliant chronicle by William Rosen of the many innovations it took to
   harness steam power. Among the most important were a new way to measure
   the energy output of engines and a micrometer dubbed the "Lord
   Chancellor," able to gauge tiny distances.

   Such measuring tools, Rosen writes, allowed inventors to see if their
   incremental design changes led to the improvements-higher-quality
   parts, better performance, and less coal consumption-needed to build
   better engines. Innovations in steam power demonstrate a larger lesson:
   Without feedback from precise measurement, Rosen writes, invention is
   "doomed to be rare and erratic." With it, invention becomes
   "commonplace."
   [01-5.jpg]

   Starting around 1805, the âLord Chancellorâ micrometer, according to
   author William Rosen, was âan Excalibur of measurement, slaying the
   dragon of imprecision,â for inventors in the Industrial Revolution. (©
   Science Museum, London)

   Of course, the work of our foundation is a world away from the making
   of steam engines. But in the past year I have been struck again and
   again by how important measurement is to improving the human condition.
   You can achieve amazing progress if you set a clear goal and find a
   measure that will drive progress toward that goal-in a feedback loop
   similar to the one Rosen describes. This may seem pretty basic, but it
   is amazing to me how often it is not done and how hard it is to get
   right.

   Getting a closer look at charts documenting rural health progress at
   the Germana Gale Health Post in Ethiopia. Over the past year Iâve been
   impressed with progress in using data and measurement to improve the
   human condition (Dalocha, Ethiopia, 2012).

   In previous annual letters, I've focused a lot on the power of
   innovation to reduce hunger, poverty, and disease. But any
   innovation-whether it's a new vaccine or an improved seed-can't have an
   impact unless it reaches the people who will benefit from it. That's
   why in this year's letter I discuss how innovations in measurement are
   critical to finding new, effective ways to deliver these tools and
   services to the clinics, family farms, and classrooms that need them.

   Our foundation is supporting these efforts, but we and others need to
   do more. Given how tight budgets are around the world, governments are
   rightfully demanding effectiveness in the programs they pay for. To
   address these demands, we need better measurement tools to determine
   which approaches work and which do not.

   In this letter I'll highlight strong examples I've seen in the past
   year of how measurement is making a difference. In Colorado, Melinda
   and I learned how a school district is pioneering a new system to
   measure and promote teacher effectiveness. In Ethiopia, I witnessed how
   a poor country, pursuing goals set by the United Nations, delivered
   better health services to its people. In Nigeria, I've seen how the
   digital revolution allows us to improve the use of measurement in the
   campaign to eradicate polio. Thanks to cell phones, satellites, and
   cheap sensors, we can gather and organize data with increasing speed
   and accuracy. These modern-day Lord Chancellors will also help speed
   progress in education and agriculture, as well as other health efforts.

   The Worldâs Report Card
   [ch2cover.jpg]

   Eight goals aimed at improving the lives of the worldâs poorest people
   have brought new focus to the highest priorities in health and
   development.

   As head of UNICEF in the 1980s, Jim Grant sparked a global effort to
   increase the number of children vaccinated against deadly diseases.

   genocide. (Nyamata, Rwanda, 1994). Â©UNICEF

   A business has increasing profit as its primary goal. Management
   decides the actions -such as improving customer satisfaction or adding
   new product capabilities-that will drive profit and then develops a
   system to measure those on a regular basis. If the managers pick the
   wrong measures or don't do better than their competition, profit goes
   down. Business magazines and business schools analyze which measures
   companies use and which companies have done particularly well or
   poorly. Other companies benefit from these analyses, learning from the
   performance of their competitors which tactics and strategies work and
   which don't. The understanding of how to use measurement to drive
   excellence in business has improved dramatically in the last 50 years.
   [pullquotetop.gif]
   The MDGs have become a report card for how the world is performing
   against major problems affecting the poor.

   Unlike business, where profit is the "bottom line," foundations and
   government programs pick their own goals. In the United States our
   foundation focuses mostly on improving education, so our goals include
   reducing the number of kids who drop out of high school. In poor
   countries we focus on health, agriculture, and family planning. Given a
   goal, you decide on what key variable you need to change to achieve
   it-the same way a business picks objectives for inside the company like
   customer satisfaction-and develop a plan for change and a way of
   measuring the change. You use the measurement as feedback to make
   adjustments. I think a lot of efforts fail because they don't focus on
   the right measure or they don't invest enough in doing it accurately.

   I think the best example of picking an important goal and using
   measurement to achieve it is the vaccination work UNICEF did under Jim
   Grant's leadership in the 1980s. Few people may have heard of Grant,
   but his impact on the world was as significant as any profit-driven
   leader like a Henry Ford or Thomas Watson.

   Grant set an ambitious goal of getting lifesaving vaccines out to 80
   percent of children worldwide. This wasn't easy in poor countries at a
   time when the fax machine was the most advanced communication tool. But
   once Grant put a robust data-gathering system in place, he was able to
   drive change. He could see which countries were successful in
   increasing their vaccination coverage rates and used that data to help
   other countries to do the same. The countries that were falling behind
   were embarrassed, and they focused more resources and attention on the
   problem than they would have without the data. Thanks to Grant's
   efforts and thousands of vaccinators, the percentage of infants
   worldwide receiving necessary vaccines rose from 17 percent in 1980 to
   75 percent in 1990, saving millions of lives every year.
   [18][CTA_Pngs_CTA_Red.png]

   Sadly, some of the gains didn't last. Once the vaccination goal was
   reached, donor attention shifted elsewhere and coverage rates drifted
   down in many countries.

   But the spirit of Grant was behind an agreement in 2000 by the United
   Nations to focus on eight goals aimed at improving the lives of the
   world's poorest people. These Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were
   supported by 189 nations, and the UN set 2015 as the deadline for
   achieving them. This was the first time goals that called for specific
   percentage improvement were picked across a set of crucial areas-such
   as health, education, and basic income. Many people assumed the pact
   would be filed away and forgotten like so many UN and government
   pronouncements. However, since the goals were clear and concrete, they
   brought focus to the highest priorities. The UN agencies, donor
   countries, and developing countries looked at which programs would
   achieve the goals at the lowest cost. They saw that many programs were
   not delivering interventions in an effective way. They started
   demanding more rigorous evaluation to measure effectiveness. In some
   cases, the goals were used to persuade countries to pursue pro-poor
   policies.
   [dev_goals_info.png]
   [19][CTA_Pngs_CTA_Unicef.png]

   As 2015 approaches, the world is taking a hard look at how it is doing
   on the goals. Although we won't achieve them all, we've made amazing
   progress, and the goals have become a report card for how the world is
   performing against major problems affecting the poor. The MDG target of
   reducing extreme poverty by half has been reached ahead of the
   deadline, as has the goal of halving the proportion of people who lack
   access to safe drinking water. Living conditions for more than 200
   million slum dwellers have also improved-double the target. Some goals,
   however, were set at such an ambitious level that they will be missed.
   For instance, while we have reduced the number of mothers who die
   during childbirth by almost 50 percent-which is incredible-we will,
   however, fall short of the goal of a 75 percent reduction.

   We're also not on track to meet one of the most critical goals-reducing
   the number of children who die under the age of five by two-thirds.
   We've made substantial progress. The number of children who die has
   declined from nearly 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011. While
   that means 14,000 fewer children around the world are dying every day
   than in 1990, we won't reach the two-thirds target by 2015.

   Still, many individual countries are on track to achieve this target.
   One of them is Ethiopia, which used the MDGs to drive an overhaul of
   its primary health care system that has led to a dramatic decline in
   childhood deaths.
   Improving Lives by Delivering Vaccines to Children in Mozambique
   2013 Gates Vaccine Innovation Award Recipient

   Vaccines inspire me. They make it possible to do something amazing:
   protect a young child from a host of diseases for life with a
   relatively cheap and simple solution. The trick is making sure that all
   children get fully immunized. That is why I created the Gates Vaccine
   Innovation Award, to recognize those who are pioneering new strategies
   to increase vaccine coverage.

   This year's recipient is Margarida Matsinhe, a field officer for
   VillageReach, a nonprofit working to improve health care in Mozambique.
   In the region where Margarida works, half the people live at least two
   hours from the nearest health post. She has been instrumental in
   overhauling the vaccine logistics system by removing numerous obstacles
   that prevent children from getting immunized.

   As a result of VillageReach's work:

    1. The monthly incidence of stockouts in rural health centers: down
       from 80 percent to 1 percent.
    2. The amount of time the cold chain is working: up from 40 percent to
       96 percent.
    3. The percentage of children receiving basic vaccines: up from 69
       percent to 95 percent.

   The lessons from Margarida's work are being applied to improve the
   health system in Mozambique, throughout Africa, and even in parts of
   India. I hope others continue to draw on the work of Margarida Matsinhe
   to provide access to vaccines for all children.

   Global Goals, Local Change
   [ch3cover.jpg]

   A commitment to reach ambitious global health targets and a new
   community health system helped Ethiopia dramatically reduce childhood
   deaths.
   [3-2.jpg]
   [20][info3-thumb.jpg]
   [3-4.jpg]
   [3-5.jpg]

   I remember the disturbing images from Ethiopia of the 1980s when more
   than one million people died in a famine that swept through the Horn of
   Africa. It was a tragedy brought to the world's attention by the 1985
   Live Aid concert and part of a long period of war, political unrest,
   and instability for Ethiopians. Their country ranked near the bottom on
   nearly every key health indicator, including child mortality.
   [07-5.jpg]

   Famine, war and political unrest in Ethiopia displaced hundreds of
   thousands of people in the 1980s, sparking an outpouring of money and
   aid from around the world (Ethiopia, 1984-1985). Â©Corbis, Chris
   Rainier

   About a decade ago that picture started to change-thanks in large part
   to a government goal to bring primary health care to all Ethiopian
   citizens. When Ethiopia signed on to the MDGs in 2000, the country put
   hard numbers on its health ambitions. The concrete MDG goal of reducing
   child mortality by two-thirds created a clear target for success or
   failure. Ethiopia's commitment to the MDGs attracted unprecedented
   amounts of donor money to help improve its primary health care
   services.

   Ethiopia found a successful model for achieving this goal in the Indian
   state of Kerala, which had lowered its child mortality rate and
   improved a host of other health indicators, in part through a vast
   network of community health care posts. This is one of the benefits of
   measurement-the ability it gives government leaders to make comparisons
   across countries, find who's doing well, and then learn from the best.
   With help from Kerala representatives, Ethiopia launched its own
   community health program in 2004.

   Today, Ethiopia has more than 15,000 health posts delivering primary
   health care to the farthest reaches of this rural country of 85
   million. They are staffed by 34,000 health workers, most of them young
   women from the communities they serve with one year of basic health
   training.

   In 2009, Melinda traveled to Ethiopia and saw how these health reforms
   were transforming the country. Where health services were once
   nonexistent, rural areas had health clinics stocked with vaccines and
   medicine. Where once there was little local health expertise, Melinda
   learned how health workers delivered babies, administered vaccines, and
   supported family planning.

   I got the chance to see that progress on my first trip to Ethiopia last
   March. Driving through the countryside, I felt the challenge Ethiopia
   faces in connecting its people to health care. Rural Ethiopia is
   composed of vast tracts of farm land-85 percent of the population
   survives on farm plots of less than two acres-connected by sometimes
   very rough roads. On the way to the Germana Gale Health Post, I saw
   piles of teff, a grain used to make Ethiopia's spongy flatbread, and I
   saw people walking everywhere. There were few other vehicles, even few
   bicycles.

   The post, a faded-green cement building, was bigger than I thought it
   would be, and you could tell workers took great care of the place.
   Inside, two health workers showed me a well-stocked cabinet of the
   tools of their job, including folic acid, Vitamin A supplements, and
   malaria drugs.
   [papers.jpg]

   At health posts in Ethiopia, meticulous record-keeping, including
   folders tracking the health of newborns, have helped the country reduce
   child mortality and increase vaccination coverage (Dalocha, Ethiopia,
   2012).

   The workers provide most services at the post, though they also visit
   the homes of pregnant women and sick people. They ensure that each home
   has access to a bed net to protect the family from malaria, a pit
   toilet, first aid training, and other basic health and safety
   practices. One health worker told me she had done 41 deliveries so far
   that year, most of which were performed at people's homes.

   All these interventions are quite basic, yet they've dramatically
   improved the lives of people in this country. Childhood death has
   decreased. So has the number of women dying in childbirth. More women
   have access to contraceptives to plan if and when they want to have
   children. Melinda has been leading the foundation to strengthen our
   commitment to family planning (see her feature below).

   Just consider the story of one young mother from Dalocha. Sebsebila
   Nassir was born in 1990 on the dirt floor of her family's hut. With
   little access to lifesaving vaccines or basic health care, about 20
   percent of all children in Ethiopia at that time did not survive to
   their fifth birthdays. Two of Sebsebila's six siblings died as infants.
   [pullquotetop.gif]
   Ethiopiaâs effort on health has lowered child mortality over 60 percent
   since 1990.
   [pullquotebottom.gif]
   [fb-icon.png]
   [twitter-icon.png]
   [pinterest-icon.gif]

   But a few years ago, when a health post opened its doors in Dalocha,
   life started to change. For the first time, she had access to
   contraceptives, so she could have children when she and her husband
   were ready. When the time came last year and Sebsebila became pregnant,
   she received regular check-ups from her health worker. The worker also
   encouraged her to have the baby at a local health center, instead of at
   home where she gave birth to her first child.

   On November 28, the day Sebsebila went into labor, she traveled by
   donkey cart to the health center. There, a midwife was at her bedside
   during her seven-hour labor. Shortly after her daughter was born, the
   baby received vaccines against polio and tuberculosis. The health
   worker also handed Sebsebila an immunization card with a schedule for
   her daughter to receive vaccinations to protect her from diphtheria,
   tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B, meningitis, pneumonia, and
   measles.
   [11-9.jpg]

   Nuria Ali, a community health worker, teaching Sebsebila Nassir about
   caring for her newborn daughter, Amira (Dalocha, Ethiopia, 2012).

   At the top of the immunization card was a blank for the name of her
   baby daughter. According to a long-held Ethiopian custom, parents wait
   to name their children because disease is rampant, health care is
   sparse, and children often die in the first weeks of life. Sebsebila
   didn't receive her own name until several weeks after her birth. And
   when her first daughter was born three years ago, she followed
   tradition and waited a month to bestow a name, afraid her child would
   not survive.

   But a lot has changed in Ethiopia since the birth of Sebsebila's first
   child. This time, with more confidence in her new baby's chances of
   survival, Sebsebila didn't hesitate to name her. In the blank at the
   top of the vaccination card, she put "Amira"-"princess" in Arabic.
   Sebsebila's newfound optimism is not an isolated case. Ethiopia's
   effort on health has lowered child mortality over 60 percent since
   1990, putting the country on track to achieve this important MDG target
   by 2015 and giving many parents the confidence to name children the day
   they are born.
   [22][CTA_Pngs_CTA_IntraHealth.png]

   Stories of progress like this underscore the importance of setting
   goals and measuring progress toward them. A decade ago, there was no
   official record of a child's birth or death in rural Ethiopia. At the
   Germana Gale Health Post, I saw charts of immunizations, malaria cases,
   and other health data plastered to walls. Each indicator had an annual
   target and a quarterly target. All this information goes into a
   government information system to generate regular reports. Government
   officials meet every two months to go over the reports to see where
   things are working and to take action in places where they aren't.

   Yet while measurement is critical to making progress in global health,
   it's very hard to do well. You have to measure accurately, as well as
   create an environment where problems can be discussed openly so you can
   effectively evaluate what's working and what's not. Setting targets for
   immunization and other interventions can motivate government health
   workers, but it can also encourage over-reporting to avoid problems
   with supervisors.

   Ethiopia's recent effort to monitor the progress of its immunization
   program is a good example of learning from data and-the hardest
   part-using data to improve delivery of the right solutions. A recent
   national survey of Ethiopia's vaccination coverage reported vastly
   different results from the government's own estimates. Ethiopia could
   have ignored this conflict and reported the most favorable data.
   Instead, it brought in independent experts to understand why the
   measurements were so different. They commissioned a detailed
   independent survey that pinpointed geographic pockets of very high
   coverage-and very low coverage. The government is now working to
   develop better plans for the poorer performing regions.

   The progress Ethiopia is making on the MDGs is now capturing the
   attention of its neighbors. Much like Ethiopia, which learned from the
   Indian state of Kerala, other countries including Malawi, Rwanda, and
   Nigeria are now rolling out health extension programs after visiting
   Ethiopia to learn from its experience.
   Measurement, Contraceptives, and Investing in Families' Futures
   By Melinda Gates

   In country after country over centuries, parents' ability to plan their
   families-to decide whether and when to have children-has been
   correlated to massive improvements in health, prosperity, and quality
   of life. But in much of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, hundreds of
   millions of women still don't have access to contraceptives.
   [08-10.jpg]

   Sadi Seyni, a mother of five, learned about contraceptives after her
   second child was born, and then began spacing the births of her
   children (Talle, Niger, 2012).
   (BUTTON)

   Last year, I spent most of my time learning and telling others why
   access (to contraceptives, information about family planning, and
   health services) matters, why it's a challenge in many countries, and
   what we can do together to fix it. For me, the most important way I
   learn is traveling to developing countries and listening to the women
   who are struggling against great odds to give their children the chance
   at a better life. A few months ago, I was in Niger where I met a young
   mother named Sadi Seyni. She has five children now and didn't learn
   about contraceptives until after her second child. She still wants more
   children, but she walks 10 miles every three months to get a
   contraceptive injection because she knows it's healthier for her and
   her children to space her pregnancies.
   [09-4.jpg]

   The leadership of British Prime Minister David Cameron, at London
   Summit on Family Planning last year, was crucial in raising awareness
   of the need to provide access to contraceptives and family planning
   (London, England, 2012).

   Every time I come back from a trip, I am overflowing with stories about
   why women like Sadi are so inspiring to me. By meeting people on the
   ground, I also get to see first-hand how the theme of Bill's annual
   letter, the role of measurement in improving delivery, can help poor
   countries serve people's needs.

   My big project in 2012 was the London Summit on Family Planning, which
   I led with Prime Minister David Cameron and the U.K.'s Department for
   International Development. The goal of the Summit was to help generate
   a global conversation about how to close the gap between the number of
   women who want to use contraceptives and the number of women who are
   currently using them.

   Dozens of partners from many different sectors-leaders of donor and
   developing countries, people working for nonprofits on the ground in
   poor countries, and pharmaceutical companies and other
   businesses-signed on to a concrete, measurable goal that is ambitious
   yet achievable: making contraceptives available to an additional 120
   million women and girls in the world's poorest countries by 2020.

   When we started the project, though, I have to admit I was frustrated
   by how loose the numbers were. Population-based surveys happen
   infrequently, and since contraceptives have to do with sensitive topics
   like sex and gender roles, solid service statistics can be hard to come
   by. I didn't feel I had an accurate picture of how many women currently
   have or lack access to contraceptives, or what could realistically be
   done to drive improvement.
   [10-4.jpg]

   At the Dominique Health Center in Dakar, Senegal, family planning pilot
   programs have vastly improved access to contraceptives in the past year
   (Dakar, Senegal, 2012).

   It was hard enough to develop a baseline of how many women were using
   contraceptives in 2012. Figuring out how many women wanted to use them
   but didn't have access was even more difficult. I learned, for example,
   that some health clinics reported having contraceptives "in stock" as
   long as condoms were on the shelves. However, many women prefer
   contraceptive injections and implants, in part because they have
   trouble negotiating the use of condoms with their sex partners. As a
   result, nobody was counting the many women who had access only to
   contraceptives they didn't want and couldn't use.

   For months, the Summit's sponsors studied numbers from many sources to
   model a rigorous baseline. They also combed through historical data
   from countries that have invested in family planning services, to
   estimate what could be achieved in the future with adequate investment.
   That's how we landed on the goal of 120 million women.

   Now individual countries are in the process of creating plans based on
   an analysis of the unique challenges they face. As a result, they zero
   in on the dominant constraints in their particular situation-whether
   that's funding, supply chain, procurement policies, demand, health
   education, or any other factor. These plans include clear milestones to
   help countries stay on track. This is the exciting part, where we can
   see how measurement leads to sweeping changes in the way health systems
   serve people.

   Senegal is one impressive example. An important part of their plan is
   to improve their contraceptive supply chain, and they're basing changes
   on a model that was pilot tested last year. The results were
   astounding: Not only were stockouts eliminated in the pilot clinics,
   but the amount of contraceptives provided to women shot up (IUDs by 52
   percent, contraceptive injections by 61 percent, oral contraceptive
   pills by 73 percent, and implants by 940 percent).

   The energy at the London Summit-and now in countries where the work is
   happening-is palpable. I am certain that we have the tools and the
   broad-based, long-term commitment to turn that energy into results for
   millions of women.

   Mapping the End of Polio
   [ch4cover.jpg]

   The fight to end polio is my top priority, and innovative measurement
   approaches are getting the global eradication initiative closer than
   ever to that goal.

   Railway Station (Bihar, India, 2011).

   Polio eradication is a top priority for the foundation, a primary focus
   for me, and a powerful example of the importance of accurate
   measurement. Starting in 1988, organizations including the U.S. Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention, Rotary International, UNICEF, and
   the World Health Organization, along with many countries of the world,
   agreed to the goal of eradicating polio. Targeting an explicit goal
   focused political will and opened purse strings to pay for large-scale
   immunization campaigns that led to very rapid progress. By 2000, the
   virus had been wiped out of the Americas, Europe, and most of Asia.

   The number of global polio cases has been under 1,000 cases for the
   last two years, but getting rid of the very last few cases is the
   hardest part. For some diseases like smallpox-which was visible on the
   skin-you can track where the cases show up and focus on vaccinating
   children in those areas. However, polio takes weeks to confirm, and
   over 95 percent of people infected with the polio virus never develop
   symptoms-so they can spread the virus without anyone realizing it.
   That's why it's called "silent transmission." In order to stop the
   spread of infections, health workers have to vaccinate nearly all
   children under the age of five multiple times a year to achieve the
   necessary immunity thresholds in polio-affected countries. It's
   estimated that this threshold is 80 to 95 percent in the parts of
   Africa and Asia that still have polio. Achieving consistent coverage
   levels to reach these thresholds requires timely, accurate, local
   measurement so you can see where you are falling below the threshold,
   figure out what is wrong, and fix it.

   Last January, after years of battling the disease, India celebrated a
   full year without a single case of polio. Most people expected India to
   be the most difficult place to eliminate polio because of its densely
   crowded urban areas, huge rural areas in the North, poor sanitation,
   large mobile populations, and over 27 million children born every
   year-more than in all of sub-Saharan Africa -that need to be
   vaccinated. Stopping the circulation of the virus everywhere in the
   country was the eradication initiative's biggest accomplishment in the
   past decade.

   There are now just three countries that have never eliminated polio:
   Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. I visited Northern Nigeria four
   years ago to try to understand why eradication is so difficult there. I
   saw that routine public health services were failing: Fewer than half
   the kids were getting vaccines regularly, and there were no reliable
   figures for how many children lived in each area. Also, the normal
   process of quality monitoring done as part of each polio campaign was
   not working. Statistics about the quality of coverage varied greatly.
   We decided we needed to invest heavily in another layer of quality
   monitoring to understand what was going wrong. This involved picking
   random locations on the map and randomly checking children in those
   places to see if they had been vaccinated. The work required specially
   trained staff working independently of the people implementing the
   vaccination campaigns. That impartiality was crucial.
   [pullquotetop.gif]
   The global polio community is now finalizing a plan which should allow
   us to finish the job of polio eradication within the next six years.
   [pullquotebottom.gif]

   [pinterest-icon.gif]

   One huge problem the polio program found was that many small
   settlements in the region were missing from vaccinators' hand-drawn
   maps and lists documenting the location of villages and numbers of
   children. As a result, children weren't getting vaccinated. Often
   villages on the border between two maps weren't assigned to any team.
   To make matters worse, the estimated distance between villages was
   sometimes off by miles, making it impossible for some vaccinators to do
   the job they were assigned.

   To fix this, the polio workers walked through all high-risk areas in
   the northern part of the country. Step by step, they explored these
   areas and spoke with people, adding 3,000 communities to the
   immunization campaigns. The program is also using high-resolution
   satellite images to create even more detailed maps. And since the new
   maps show the true distances between settlements, managers can now
   allocate vaccinators efficiently by giving them a full day's work but
   no more.

   Another problem was that some teams were simply not going to the places
   they were assigned to go. To help address this, the program is piloting
   the use of phones equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS)
   application for the vaccinators to carry. Tracks are downloaded from
   the phone to a laptop at the end of the day so managers can see the
   route the vaccinators followed and compare it to the route they were
   assigned. This helps ensure that areas that were missed can be
   revisited so children are not left unprotected from polio.
   [maps.jpg]

   Smart use of technology can help set the building blocks of healthy
   societies. In Nigeria satellite images are replacing hand-drawn maps,
   allowing health workers to reach previously overlooked villages with
   vaccines.

   The Nigerian government and its partners will need to keep working
   closely to adjust tools and approaches like these to measure coverage
   in Northern Nigeria more accurately. But progress is definitely being
   made, and more children are being reached.
   [25]
   [CTA_Pngs_CTA_Polio.png]

   The insecurity in Pakistan and Afghanistan represents another challenge
   for the campaign. In December nine polio vaccinators in Pakistan were
   murdered. It is unimaginable to me why health workers, whose only goal
   was to improve children's health and end polio, were targeted. In my
   eyes the victims are heroes, and the best way to respect their memory
   is to finish the job they gave their lives for. The polio program will
   continue, with additional efforts to improve the safety of workers and
   to increase the support of community leaders. The global polio
   community is now finalizing a detailed plan that I believe should allow
   us to finish the job of polio eradication within the next six years.

   The measurement systems put in place by the eradication initiative will
   be invaluable for other health care activities, including routine
   vaccination of infants, which means the legacy of polio eradication
   will live beyond stopping a disease that once paralyzed over 400,000
   children every year.

   Feedback for Teacher Growth
   [ch5cover.jpg]

   Teachers get little feedback on their work, but new advances in
   measuring teacher effectiveness provide opportunities to improve
   education.
   [5-3.jpg]
   [5-4.jpg]
   [5-5.jpg]

   In October, Melinda and I found ourselves near Vail, Colorado, sitting
   among two dozen twelfth graders learning how to write narrative
   nonfiction pieces. Looking around, I saw about a third of the class was
   Hispanic; approximately half of Eagle County School District's 6,300
   students are Hispanic, and the district has among the highest rates of
   English language learners in Colorado.

   We were there to watch the person at the front of the room, Mary Ann
   Stavney, a veteran of Colorado's education system who taught high
   school, served on the county school board, and instructed at a local
   college before taking on her current role as a language arts and speech
   teacher at Eagle Valley High School.
   [23-8.jpg]

   As a Master Teacher in Eagle Valley High School, Mary Ann Stavney
   splits her time between teaching students and evaluating teachers
   (Gypsum, CO, 2012).
   [pullquotetop.gif]
   I think the most critical change we can make in U.S. K-12 education is
   to create teacher feedback systems that are properly funded,
   high-quality, and trusted by teachers.
   [pullquotebottom.gif]
   [fb-icon.png]
   [twitter-icon.png]
   [pinterest-icon.gif]

   In class that day, Mary Ann taught a 40-minute lesson on how students
   could use evidence to bolster claims in their essays, including a
   lively mini-lesson on how to use starters like "because," "as a
   result," and "although." She engaged her students, walking among them,
   asking good questions, and eliciting great participation.

   Both Melinda and I could see why Mary Ann is a Master Teacher, a
   distinction given to the school's best teachers and an important
   component of a teacher-evaluation system in Eagle County. In that role,
   she is trained to evaluate and provide feedback to other teachers. Her
   work is part of a broader approach to measuring teacher performance
   that includes test data showing student learning, evaluations from
   Master Teachers and the school principal, and students' surveys about
   their teachers. The district is an early innovator in using a mix of
   measures to help teachers improve.

   I was amazed to learn a few years ago that over 90 percent of teachers
   get zero feedback on how to improve. A lot of the debate in education
   today really amounts to a circular discussion of how to implement tools
   to measure teacher effectiveness and whether such measurement is even
   possible. We know that if all teachers were anywhere near as good as
   the best, our education system would be fantastic.

   Starting in 2009, the foundation funded a project called Measures of
   Effective Teaching, or MET, that worked with 3,000 classroom teachers
   to better understand how to build an evaluation and feedback system to
   help teachers improve. In January 2013, we announced the final results
   of the MET project. The report concluded that there were observable,
   repeatable, and verifiable ways of measuring teacher effectiveness. MET
   highlighted several measures that schools should use to assess teacher
   performance, including student surveys and reports from trained
   evaluators who observe teachers at work.
   [24-4.jpg]

   Discussing class work with students at South High School (Denver, CO,
   2012).

   Colorado is a pioneer in introducing these principles, and Eagle County
   is helping lead the way. About 10 years ago the district threw out its
   traditional seniority-based evaluation system and moved to a
   performance-based one. It didn't go over well. Teachers spoke out
   against what they thought was a flawed plan with too much emphasis on
   student tests and too little support from the district-among other
   concerns. By 2008 the majority of the district's central office had
   changed, and the school board had hired a new superintendent, Dr.
   Sandra Smyser, whom we met on our trip.

   Now teachers feel the system helps them improve. Over the course of a
   school year, each of Eagle County's 470 teachers is evaluated three
   times and is observed in class at least nine times. The process starts
   with Mentor Teachers, who spend 30 percent of their time observing
   their colleagues in their classrooms and coaching them in areas that
   need improvement. Then a Master Teacher and the principal observe
   classes, some with advance notice, others unannounced. Master Teachers,
   who dedicate 70 percent of their time to this work, hold conferences
   with the teacher before each planned evaluation and give feedback
   afterwards.

   The Eagle County system is impressive because it focuses on helping
   each teacher grow. The evaluations are used to give a teacher not only
   a score but also specific feedback on areas to improve and ways to
   build on their strengths. In addition to one-on-one coaching, Mentors
   and Masters lead weekly group meetings in which teachers discuss
   student work and collaborate to spread their skills. Teachers are
   eligible for annual salary increases and bonuses based on the classroom
   observations and student achievement. Sandra, the superintendent, said
   the system has helped retain teachers.
   [25-8.jpg]

   Fourth-grade teacher Courtney Artis, whose class is part of the MET
   project, talking with a student at Cornelius Elementary School
   (Cornelius, NC, 2012).

   Colorado state law mandates that by the 2013-2014 school year, ratings
   for all teachers should be based half on the change in students' test
   results and half on other measures. Sandra and her colleagues said
   they've struggled with how to incorporate student test scores into the
   evaluation process. One reason: It's harder to test student improvement
   in some areas-music and art-than in others-such as math and science.

   The program also faces challenges from tightening budgets. Mentor and
   Master Teachers are paid extra, and since a chunk of their time is
   dedicated to coaching and evaluating, the district needed to bring on
   other teachers to fill in for them. I found it amazing, though, that
   even with budget cuts in each of the last two years, Eagle County was
   able to keep its evaluation and support system intact. The system is
   likely one reason why student test scores have improved in Eagle County
   over the past five years.

   I think the most critical change we can make in U.S. K-12 education is
   to create teacher feedback systems like the one in Eagle County that
   are properly funded, high quality, and trusted by teachers. These
   measurement systems need to provide teachers with the tools to help
   support their professional development. The lessons from these efforts
   will help us improve teacher education programs. The countries that
   have better education systems than the United States provide more
   teacher feedback than we do today, but I think it is possible to do
   even better than any country has done so far.

   The Way Forward
   [ch6cover.jpg]

   The world faces many challenges, but we have an opportunity to
   accelerate progress against poverty, hunger, and disease in the years
   ahead.

   The lives of the poorest have improved more rapidly in the last 15
   years than ever before, yet I am optimistic we will do even better in
   the next 15 years.
   [pullquotebottom.gif]
   [fb-icon.png]

   The lives of the poorest have improved more rapidly in the last 15
   years than ever before, yet I am optimistic that we will do even better
   in the next 15 years. After all, human knowledge is increasing. We can
   see this concretely in the invention of new medicines like HIV drugs
   and the way their prices have come down, and in the creation of new
   seeds that allow poor farmers to be more productive. Once these tools
   are invented, they are never un-invented-they just improve.

   Skeptics point out that we have a hard time delivering new tools to the
   people who need them. This is where the innovation of using measurement
   is making a big difference. The process I have described-setting clear
   goals, picking the right approach, and then measuring results to get
   feedback and refine the approach continually-helps us to deliver tools
   and services to everybody who will benefit. This innovation to reduce
   the delivery bottleneck is critical. Following the path of the steam
   engine long ago, progress isn't "doomed to be rare and erratic." We
   can, in fact, make it commonplace.

   Though I am an optimist, I am not blind to the problems we face. There
   are challenges we must overcome to speed up progress in the next 15
   years. Two that worry me the most are the possibility that we won't be
   able to raise the funds needed to pay for health and development
   projects, and that we won't align around clear goals to help the
   poorest.

   The good news on resources is that many developing countries have
   growing economies that allow them to devote more resources to helping
   their poorest people. India, for example, is less dependent on aid and
   will eventually not need it.

   IFRAME:
   [26]https://www.youtube.com/embed/00_-HZYqfo4?vq=hd720&rel=0&autohide=1
   &modestbranding=1&showinfo=1&wmode=opaque&version=3

   Some countries, like the U.K., Norway, Sweden, Korea, and Australia,
   are increasing their aid while others, even traditionally generous
   givers like Japan and the Netherlands, have reduced it. The direction
   in many countries, including the United States, France, Germany, and
   Canada, is unclear.

   Still, aid is critical. It helps meet the basic needs of people in the
   poorest countries. It funds innovation-in the creation of new tools and
   services and in their delivery. Unfortunately, aid generosity is
   threatened by big deficits in almost all of the rich countries. Unless
   voters hear about the positive impact their generosity is having,
   they'll inevitably focus on issues closer to home. A single story, true
   or not, about a small amount of aid being misused can often cloud the
   entire field. Imagine how you would feel about investing if every
   article you read was only about stocks that did poorly and not about
   the big successes.

   Historically, aid was discussed largely in terms of the total amount of
   money invested. But now that we're more precisely measuring indicators
   like child mortality, people are able to see the impact aid has in
   stark terms-that it's the difference between putting people on HIV
   treatment or letting them die. When framed this way, aid has a better
   chance of becoming a priority for people.

   Stephen, during a visit to the Coptic Mission Hospital (Lusaka, Zambia,
   2012).
   [27][CTA_Pngs_CTA_ONE.png]

   My second concern about the next 15 years is whether the world will
   align around a clear set of goals. The United Nations is starting to
   map out new goals for the years following the 2015 expiration of the
   current MDGs. As with the first round, the next set of goals could help
   align groups doing the work, remind voters what their generosity
   supports, and allow us to see where we are making progress in
   delivering solutions to the poor.

   The success of the MDGs means that there is a lot of interest in
   expanding them to include a broader set of issues. But many of the
   potential new goals don't have unanimous support, and adding many new
   goals, or goals that are not easily measurable, may sap momentum.

   The MDGs were coherent because they focused on helping the poorest
   people in the world. The groups that needed to work together on the
   MDGs were easy to identify, and they could be held accountable for
   cooperation and progress. When the UN reaches agreement on other
   important goals like mitigating climate change, it should consider
   whether a different set of actors and a separate process might be best
   for those efforts.

   I hope everyone who reads this is excited to see how much progress the
   world has made in helping the poorest in the last 15 years. It is the
   kind of good-news story that happens one life at a time and so it often
   doesn't get the same visibility as a big setback like the outbreak of a
   new epidemic. From time to time we should step back and celebrate the
   achievements that come with having the right goals-combined with
   political will, generous aid, and innovation in tools and their
   delivery. It has certainly deepened my commitment to this work.
