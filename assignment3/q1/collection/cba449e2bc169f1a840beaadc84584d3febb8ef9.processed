     * I'm no hero, Charles Ramsey tells CNN
     * Charles Ramsey's 911 call: "She needs everything. She's in a panic,
       bro."
     * His quick action freed three women and a girl allegedly held

   (CNN) -- Within hours of becoming a national hero, a viral video star
   and the [43]top topic on Twitter, Charles Ramsey talked about having
   trouble getting sleep.

   It wasn't because of all the excitement that followed his knocking down
   a Cleveland neighbor's door, freeing [44]three women and a girl who
   police say were held hostage for years.

   Instead, Ramsey told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday, it was about
   knowing he had lived for a year near the captive women on the city's
   West Side.

   "Up until yesterday the only thing that kept me from losing sleep was
   the lack of money," the restaurant dishwasher said on "Anderson Cooper
   360."

   "I could have done this last year, not this hero stuff," said Ramsey.
   "Just do the right thing."

   Ramsey recounted Monday night's drama, when he heard a girl scream
   "like a car had hit a kid."

   He ran from his living room, clutching a half-eaten McDonald's Big Mac,
   to the house and helped free a woman identified as Amanda Berry.

   "Amanda said, 'I've been trapped in here. He won't let me out. It's me
   and my baby."

   [45]Who are the three women freed in Cleveland?

   Ramsey and a man named Angel Cordero broke down the door, [46]CNN
   affiliate WEWS reported in an earlier interview heard around the world.

   Ramsey told CNN he had never seen Berry before Monday, and at first, he
   could not place the name.

   "Berry didn't register with me until I was on the phone, like wait a
   minute, I thought this girl was dead."

   "She's like, 'This (expletive) kidnapped me and my daughter,'" he told
   the 911 operator, according to WEWS.

   Why the Web loves Ramsey

   After police arrived, Berry explained there were other women inside.
   When police came out with them, Ramsey told the station, "it was
   astonishing."

   Berry was last seen after finishing her shift at a Burger King in
   Cleveland in 2003 on the eve of her 17th birthday.

   The other two women are Georgina "Gina" DeJesus, who disappeared at age
   14 in 2004, and Michelle Knight, who vanished in August 2002, at age
   21, according to police.

   Ramsey told CNN he is no hero and should not receive any reward.

   "You've got to put that being a coward and 'I don't want to get in
   nobody's business,'" he said. "You got to put that away for a minute."

   'I barbecue with this dude'

   While Ramsey's quick action in the largely rundown neighborhood made
   him a hero, his colorful descriptions to WEWS helped make him dream
   fodder for the Twitterverse.

   Explaining that he had no idea Ariel Castro, his neighbor, may have had
   other people inside his home, Ramsey said, "I've been here a year. You
   see where I'm coming from? I barbecue with this dude. We eat ribs and
   whatnot and listen to salsa music...

   "He just comes out to his backyard, plays with the dogs, tinkers with
   his cars and motorcycles, goes back in the house. So he's somebody you
   look, then look away. He's not doing anything but the average stuff.
   You see what I'm saying? There's nothing exciting about him. Well,
   until today."

   Castro "got some big testicles to pull this off, bro," Ramsey told
   WEWS. "Because we see this dude every day. I mean every day."
   There's nothing exciting about him. Well, until today.
   Charles Ramsey, neighbor

   He added, "I knew something was wrong when a little, pretty white girl
   ran into a black man's arms. Something is wrong here. Dead giveaway."

   In one of the top tweets about Ramsey, [47]comedian Patton Oswalt
   wrote, "Dear Charles Ramsey: I am not a little pretty white girl, but I
   totally want to run into your black arms. #hero."

   Hodge's restaurant in Cleveland [48]posted a message on Facebook
   saying, "we're extremely proud of our employee Charles Ramsey for not
   turning his back on the young women. He's a true Cleveland hero. Our
   thoughts and prayers will continue to be with the women, their families
   and their friends."

   Restaurant owner Chris Hodgson told CNN that Ramsey goes above and
   beyond in his duties.

   "You give him something to do, and he'll do more," he said. "We always
   look forward to seeing him, because you know he's gonna bring a smile
   to your face."

   Hodgson said people have offered to raise money for Ramsey, but the
   employee would end up giving it to the victims and their families.

   The company is working with other restaurants to plan fund-raisers for
   the families, Hodgson said.

   For its part, McDonald's Corp., on its Twitter account Tuesday, said,
   "Way to go Charles Ramsey -- we'll be in touch."

   Despite his assertions, Ramsey and Berry were praised as heroes by John
   Walsh, former host of TV's "America's Most Wanted."

   At an awards dinner for the National Center for Missing & Exploited
   Children, Walsh said he called Ramsey on Tuesday to tell him that.

   "You are the guy who decided in 30 seconds to go up and spring a woman
   from a house of hell that she's been in and was desperate to get out
   that door with her 6-year-old daughter," Walsh recalled saying.

   Ramsey said he was raised to help women in distress, said Walsh.

   Breathless 911 call

   Ramsey's demeanor comes across clearly in his 911 call.

   "Hey bro," Ramsey tells the 911 operator. "Check this out. I just came
   from McDonald's right? So I'm on my porch eating my little food, right?
   This broad is trying to break out the f-----g house next door to me, so
   there's a bunch of people on the street right now and s--t. So we're
   like, 'What's wrong, what's the problem?' She's like, 'This m--------r
   done kidnapped me and my daughter ... She said her name is Linda Berry
   or some s--t. I don't know who the f--k that is, I just moved over
   here, bro. You know what I mean?"

   He then answers the 911 operator's questions about the woman, what she
   looks like, and what she's wearing.

   Ramsey tells the operator an address which he says corresponds to
   Berry's location, not Ramsey's home address. "I'm smarter than that,
   bro. I'm telling you where the crime was, not my house," he says.

   "Are the people that she said did this, are they still in the house?"
   the 911 operator asks.

   "I don't have a f-----g clue, bro. Like I said, I just came from
   McDonald's."

   The operator then asks him to check whether Berry needs an ambulance.

   "She needs everything. She's in a panic, bro. She's been kidnapped, so,
   you know, put yourself in her shoes."

   "We'll send the police out," the operator responds.

   CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.
