Anti-abortion Bills Worry Ohio Providers

   By Ohio Public Radio

   Some Ohio doctors and medical clinic managers say if the Ohio
   legislature passes some anti-abortion bills now under consideration,
   it's very possible there will be a shortage of doctors and medical
   facilities to serve the needs of Ohio women.

   And they warn more Ohio women will die due to complications from
   pregnancies. Ohio Public Radio's Jo Ingles has details.
   [59]Listen

   There are four bills in the Ohio legislature that are worrying some
   doctors.  Three are attached to the budget. One would re-prioritize and
   thereby cut federal funding for Planned Parenthood and other family
   planning clinics.  The other two would make it harder for abortion
   clinics to get the transfer agreements with hospitals that are needed
   to operate and would give the state health director more control over
   those clinics.  Another new bill would put many restrictions on
   abortion, including possibly requiring transvaginal ultrasounds,
   requiring doctors to tell patients information that many physicians say
   is incorrect, and mandating certain abortions could be done when
   there's only a clearly defined medical emergency.  OB/GYN Marc Parnes
   says if these bills pass, Ohio's maternal death rate to increase.

   Parnes -I believe truly that it will put lives in jeopardy.

   OB/GYN Dr. Jason Melillo agrees.

   Melillo - Unfortunately you end up with a husband without a wife or
   other kids without a Mother for something that's completely
   preventable.  That's where we see these kinds of things in action on a
   daily basis.  It's different when people talk about these things in
   abstract and they talk about people who just don't want to be
   pregnant.  We see far more pople who want to be pregnant but
   unfortunately something happens, either to the Mom or the baby or the
   pregnancy in general.  And you are not making a decision between the
   Mom and the baby most times.  You are making a decision between saving
   the Mom and losing them both.  And that's where you run into trouble
   with things like this when politicians start intervening in places they
   have no business doing so.

   Columbus OB/GYN Chris Copeland has delivered more than eight thousand
   babies in his practice.  But he says the bills under consideration
   would tie the hands of doctors.  And he thinks many doctors would steer
   clear of practicing obstetrics and gynecology because of it, creating a
   doctor shortage, especially in already underserved areas of the state.
   Plus he thinks it will drive up costs.

   Copeland - If these kind of changes get put into effect, you are going
   to see malpractice rates go up once again because there will be
   increased risks associated with that for somebody trying to practice
   medicine.

   Gonadakis - There's no basis in fact there because I don't know of one
   doctor who's going to leave the state of Ohio because we are trying to
   make sure abortion clinics are safe, clean and legally operated.

   That's Mike Gonadakis, president of Ohio Right to Life.  He takes issue
   with the doctors' views on the new legislation.  He says the doctors
   are wrong when they say these bills will be dangerous for Ohio women.

   Gonadakis - Apparently anyone at that press conference didn't read what
   the actual amendments will do.  It protects pro life taxpayer dollars
   and it insures women's health.  Any other claims is just rhetoric.  As
   far as plans to reprioritize federal family planning dollars and taking
   money away from Planned Parenthood, Gonadakis says the idea is to make
   the money goes where low income women go.

   Gonadakis - What we did is have the money follow the women and where
   women are going who need access to these family planning dollars are to
   community health centers - the vast majority of them are.

   Gonadakis says the majority of Ohio lawmakers are pro life and doing
   the will of voters.  Opponents of these bills say the current lawmakers
   are enjoying bad redistricting plans.  But Dr. Melillo says the
   politics of these bills shouldn't matter anyway.

   Melillo - I am not a politician or policy maker.  I am a doctor.  And
   when I wear this coat, I am neither pro life or pro choice.  I am not
   red nor blue. I am not Democrat or Republican. I am an advocate for my
   patients in all regards.  And if a woman can't trust that her doctor is
   doing what is in her best interest because he or she is mandated by the
   State of Ohio to either say or do things that might not be the best for
   her, then the entire doctor patient relationship is compromised.
