[22]This week in the war on voting: Bipartisan election commission seen as
weak tea by some critics

   This week in the war on voting is a joint project of Joan McCarter and
   Meteor Blades

   o [29]Voting Commission could modernize elections: President Obama
   [30]announced the members of the new Presidential Commission on
   Election Administration Tuesday. The task of the 10-member commission
   is to "to identify non-partisan ways to shorten lines at polling
   places, promote the efficient conduct of elections, and provide better
   access to the polls for all voters," according to a commission press
   release.

   The commission is co-chaired Bob Bauer--the White House counsel from
   December 2009 until 2011. He was also general counsel to the
   president's re-election committee as well to the Democratic National
   Committee--and Ben Ginsberg, who served as national counsel to the
   Bush-Cheney presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004, and as national
   counsel to the Romney for President campaigns in 2008 and 2012.

     "We urge the commission to recommend bold solutions to modernize
     voting," Democracy Program Director Wendy Weiser [31]told MSNBC.
     "America needs to upgrade how we register voters, when we vote, and
     how we manage polling places."

   Nathaniel Persily, a professor at Columbia Law School [32]who has
   generally been skeptical of voting restrictions aimed at combating
   fraud, [33]will be the commission's senior research director.

   But some critics aren't happy that none of the members are voter-rights
   advocates. Rick Hasen, founder and editor/publisher of the acclaimed
   Election Law Blog, said this omission may have been intentional to
   avoid squabbling:

     "While including voting-rights advocates might make sense in the
     abstract, the Commission is walking a difficult political line to
     stay above the partisan fray as much as possible," Hasen said via
     email. "Including voting-rights advocates would have led those on
     the right to call for more balance."

     Elizabeth McNamara, the president of the League of Women Voters,
     criticized what she views as the panel's narrow mandate.

     "This is a weak response to a big problem," McNamara said in a
     statement. "We need bold action to protect Americans from the risk
     of disenfranchisement."

   o [34]San Francisco voting guide for fall 2013 clocks in at 500 pages:

     The phonebook-sized guide is courtesy of a city law that requires
     the full text of a referendum, as it was presented during the
     signature drive, to appear in the voter's guide.

     The legal text for the referendum--regarding the height of a condo
     project--includes numerous pages of text from the city's planning
     commission, board of supervisor meeting testimony and environmental
     studies.

   You can find more war on voting news below the fold.

   o [35]New Hampshire Senate cuts number of acceptable IDs for voting: In
   a strictly party-line vote of 13-10 Thursday, the New Hampshire Senate
   passed a bill to chop the list of acceptable photo IDs from seven to
   four. One change: Student photo IDs are no longer in the statutory
   language. Local election officials will have the discretion to
   determine whether the IDs are good enough to allow students to vote.
   All those changes will have to be conferenced with the
   Democratic-controlled House, which had retained the list of seven
   acceptable forms of ID. Even if agreement can be reached, Gov. Maggie
   Hassan could very well veto it.

   The Senate move made moot [36]a "bipartisan" effort by the state's
   Young Democrats and College Republicans to change the original form of
   the bill because it would have treated student IDs issued by public
   universities as acceptable but left it up to local election officials
   whether to accept student IDs from private universities. In a joint
   letter, leaders of the two groups wrote:

     "While we often have our differences on issues being debated in the
     State House in Concord or in Congress, we have nonetheless united to
     ensure the equal treatment of students in the New Hampshire
     electoral process with strong hopes that our counterparts in the
     State House and State Senate will do the same," they concluded.

   o [37]Florida Gov. Scott reinstates early voting days: The governor has
   signed a bill that reverses voting changes that he and conservative
   legislators supported two years ago. The bill reinstates additional
   days of early voting that contributed to a a mess at the polls in
   November. The new law expands early voting from eight to 14 days and
   extends early voting hours from eight to 12 hours a day. It also
   increases the number of polling places by including courthouses, civic
   centers, stadiums, convention centers, fairgrounds and government-owned
   senior and community centers. County officials can also hold early
   voting on the Sunday before election day, something of particular
   concern to black churches, many of whose congregations are
   traditionally encouraged to go to the polls en masse after the service
   is over:

     The 2012 Presidential Election was a nightmare in Florida with the
     final tallies coming in days after Obama officially won. [...]

     At least 201,000 Florida voters did not cast ballots on Election Day
     2012 because they were discouraged by the long lines that ballooned
     at polling places.

   Some Senate Democrats objected to provisions that they feel [38]give
   too much leeway to local election officals.

   o [39]Washington Post poll shows election officials biased against
   Latinos: Harvard political science graduate students Julie Faller, Noah
   Nathan and Ariel White conducted a nationwide study that found local
   election officials were less responsive to requests for voting
   information if they come from people with a Latino-sounding name like
   "Luis Rodriguez."

   The three "contacted every local official or election commission
   responsible for overseeing elections for each county or municipality at
   which elections are administered in 48 states." The messages they sent
   asked the simple question: I've been hearing a lot about voter ID laws
   on the news. What do I need to do to vote?

   When it was signed Greg Walsh, they got a very different response than
   when they signed it Luis Rodriguez.

     After all the responses were back, they had a sample including 6,825
     sent e-mails to officials in 46 states.** At least 4,557 officials
     replied. But the interesting story is in who they did and didn't
     reply to. "Responses to Latino names," the researchers write, "are
     three-and-a-half to four percentage points less likely than to
     non-Latino white names."  [...]

     The finding holds up when you drop certain regions, when you drop
     small towns, and when you control for whether officials are elected
     or appointed. What's more, they find that there are actually
     statistically significant differences in the quality of response
     from officials, depending on what kind of name is used. Responses to
     Latino voters were likelier to be non-informative, less likely to be
     "absolutely accurate" (that is, giving complete and accurate
     information about the relevant topic), and even less likely to take
     a friendly tone

   Not a happy result. But not unexpected.

   o [40]Ohio voter fraud a speck in 2012 new report says:

     0.002397 percent.

     That's how much voter fraud there was in Ohio last year, according
     to a report released yesterday by Republican Secretary of State Jon
     Husted. Out of about 5.63 million votes cast in a presidential
     election in this key swing state, there were 135 possible
     voter-fraud cases referred to law enforcement for more
     investigation.

   Husted has been at forefront of an effort to reduce voting hours and
   other measures Democrats have argued reduce numbers at the polls,
   particularly numbers of people more likely to vote Democratic than
   Republican. But, nearly alone among Republican officials in Ohio and
   elsewhere, he has not favored passing a strict photo IDs law.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Discussing the Blue Ribbon Panel in isolation doesn't provide a

       The other wants to narrow it.  There's no "bipartisan" or "middle

       I was going to write the same thing.
       I live in an affluent area (for the schools), extremely Republican,
       and I skipped right to the polling booth on election day (to cast
       my pointless votes for non-Republican local pols.)  I don't think
       the GOP has any interest in shortening lines at polling places, or
       providing better access to the polls for all voters, where those
       problems exist, because we all know where those problems exist, and
       frankly what good does easier voting do other than put more
       (commie/socialist/fascist/gay/elitist/
       lying/cheating/stealing/gun-grabbing/freedom-hating) Dems in
       office, and that means more obamaphones and welfare queens and

 We hear an awful lot of bluster from the right ([150]5+ / 0-)

          [151]Dave in Northridge, [152]Words In Action, [153]Eric Nelson,

   about "voter fraud" but the only fraud being perpetrated here is being
   done by those loud voices in the GOP who would like you to think they
   actually like the idea of elections.

   Like with so much else, here we have an entire political class who is
   actively trying to subvert the right to vote, targeting students, the
   poor, basically, anyone who might vote Democratic, and the "very
   serious people" have to pretend it's just a "debate". I look at the
   tinkering in NH with IDs and, well, there you go.

   The voting problem isn't fraud, of course, it's that Republicans don't
   want you to exercise your franchise if you aren't inclined to exercise
   it the way they want you to. Instead, we've got expensive commissions
   to protect the elephant in the room. It's time for some truth telling
   here.

   BTW, that is NOT to say that Democrats haven't been guilty of some
   pretty egregious electoral practices. Of course they have, this is
   politics after all. But just because you can point at Mayor Daley or
   Mayor Curley  or the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys doesn't make it right
   when the GOP wants to try to keep students, minorities, the elderly and
   lots of other kinds of people away from the polls.

   My prediction is that this commission will exacerbate the problem by
   giving the GOP's attempt in some states to limit voting rights the
   cover of legitimacy.

   I resent that. I demand snark, and overly so -- Markos Moulitsas.

       to (there are some people who actually like to go to the polls, and
       I'm one of them though I often vote absentee because I'm registered
       to vote in a town where I don't live in November, usually but do
       live in much of the rest of the year) I think we need to look at
       moving our elections to Sundays. After all, for all the religiosity
       of some of the folks that would object to it on religious grounds,
       many of those voices are on the Sunday Shows when I'm at church,
       which I find pretty rich. People have time for football on Sundays,
       too. It would be a great time for people to vote.
       Any number of nations already do this or--like many states
       including my own--allow early voting. I say expand the opportunity
       as much as possible to have your voice heard.

       the more I realize every state is different , but I still feel
       nationalized rules could help address them all  , but you have to

   It's time to say it out loud.  California's experience with direct
   democracy is a bust.  We have so many ballot initiatives that no one
   can reasonably be expected to be properly informed when going to the
   polls.

   I'm a lawyer, and I read lots of long, boring documents as part of my
   job.  But I don't think I should be expected to read through 500 pages
   of gobbledygook just so that I can cast a vote on a single initiative
   that concerns an issue as picayune as building height.  Those are the
   kinds of things the Board of Supervisors is elected to decide.

   This latest ballot pamphlet is just more proof that the initiative
   process is out of whack.  We have local and state legislators to handle
   these things.  If they don't do a good job, we can vote them out.
   Asking the voters to decide questions of governance and policy, both
   state and local, large and small, is just too much.  As I frequently
   say, I don't have time to govern the state of California; I already
   have a full time job.

 And Texas has constitutional amedments ([204]2+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [205]Eric Nelson, [206]Patango

       The Texas Constitution is a very cluttered document. Each biennium
       seems to have at least 10 amendments submitted to the voters.
       Amendments often make an exception for one of the 254 counties. An
       amendment requires 2/3 of both houses of the Legislature and then a
       simple majority of people actually voting.
       I first voted in 1962. Various local hospital districts had been
       created by constitutional amendment. On the November was a generic
       hospital district and I voted (absentee) for it. Then I got into a
       conversation with a campaign worker (who was also a legislative
       aide) who said this amendment was extremely dangerous because it
       could sneak hospital districts on people. A buddy of mine asked me
       whether I told told this aide she was crazy. You see, legislators
       like to be able to offer constitutional amendments to their
       constituents. And most voters are reluctant to incovenience people
       on the other side of the state.
       Censorship is rogue government.

 And conservatives in Texas ([210]0+ / 0-)
       are all about small simple government , right? Oh the irony
       We had a rather big election for one of the spots on the Iowa
       Supreme Court in 2010 , the wording was so screwed up on the ballot
       , you could not tell if you should pick yes or no , and that was
       with it being published before hand , gobbledygook is spot on
       ...And we are support to have a pretty reliable BIPARTISAN
       COMMISSION over seeing these details

     We have local and state legislators to handle these things.  If they
     don't do a good job, we can vote them out.  Asking the voters to
     decide questions of governance and policy, both state and local,
     large and small, is just too much.  As I frequently say, I don't
     have time to govern the state of California; I already have a full
     time job.

   If I had wanted to govern California, I would have run for office.

 I can see why Elizabeth McNamara has concerns ([221]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [222]Susan from 29, [223]Patango

     Elizabeth McNamara, the president of the League of Women Voters,
     criticized what she views as the panel's narrow mandate.

   [224]MSNBC - 4:58 PM on 05/21/2013

     In an interview with MSNBC, McNamara elaborated. "If they're not
     talking about secure online voter registration that's available to
     everybody, not just those with driver's licenses; if they're not
     talking about early voting; if they're not talking about polling
     place resources; if they're not talking about permanent and portable
     voter registration, then we just don't believe that they're going to
     be talking about the issues that really cause the lines on Election
     Day," she said

   It seems the focus as stated by the Brennan Center has been a response
   that takes up the republicans main BS framing: That "voter fraud"  must
   be addressed before all else, even though Ohio's  0.002397 percent
   fraud figure is typical in many other states. Practically zero

   Yet the number one concern as listed is registration. When what was/is
   "plaguing" voters is the republican party, Husted, Scott (who is
   backing off because people got pissed off imo) Or Cuccinelli and many
   other GOP assholes.

   [225]Brennan Center for Justice

     There are three reforms that would dramatically reduce the excessive
     lines that plague voting, and have the added benefit of creating a
     more efficient and secure electoral system:


     1.Modernizing voter registration
      2.Providing early voting during a fixed national time period
      3.Setting minimum standards for polling place access

   Good ideas to be sure but once again the narrative put out by
   republicans is adopted by Dems when the solutions are sought.

   It f*cking pisses me off, how polite accomodation must always be the
   rule.

   Tell it like it is. The GOP need hammering in the worst way. They are
   guilty of voter suppression. Why be nice to them when the proper thing
   to do is dissect what really happened with elections - the GOP.

   Investigations and remedies have to include the republicans like GOP
   Rep. [226]Turzai.

   Blatant illegal acts by the republicans. Wrong polling dates and
   locations put out by republicans especcially to the Latino communities.
   Dirty tricks of many kinds

   Instead number one step:

    1. Drop the Hammer on the GOP

    2. Modernizing voter registration

    3. Providing early voting during a fixed national time period

    4. Setting minimum standards for polling place access

   There.. fixed

 soooo.... appeasement? ([229]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   "Including voting-rights advocates would have led those on the right to
   call for more balance."

   "balance" meaning people sympathetic to the right-wing Voter Fraud
   myth. if  they believe that there is a real effort to threaten peoples
   ability to vote, that's Leftist and Biased and Bad. if they are
   concerned about voter fraud, well, that's "centrist" (not really) and
   that's good.

   now we'll get a bunch of squishes who will try very hard to have a
   "debate" on this and give even more legitimacy to the Voter Fraud lie.
   it's apparently worth it so that we don't offend any Republicans by
   calling them out on their blatantly anti-American policies

   Banking on the American people to be able to sort all this out and
   declare the adult in the room the winner is a very big bet. -Digby

   every DC democrat , including the Obama team , can not see what a joke
   this commission well be  , just look at the disaster from the Bush
   voting commission , I am just disgusted when I see obama present such
   dysfunction , it is kind of offending that they do not know better  ,
   they will present nothing but BS by the end of it

   The comments here and the diary sum it up well , it is pretty simple

   Iowa here is 1/2 blue and red , I am not aware of any voting troubles
   in the red west here

   But an interesting example of dem verses GOP voting can be found in the
   2012 primaries , the Iowa gop primary was full of dysfunction ,fraud ,
   confusion , and back room deals , and it is still going on with the
   investigation of Michelle Bachmann lol

   That was also seen in GOP primaries across the nation , but the bubble
   boys of DC still do not want to address the real culprits

 Amazed at voting alternatives in B.C. election ([237]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [238]maryru

   Until I started following the War on Voting here, I'd never considered
   the limits on voting in my own province. I was surprised at the variety
   of options available to me, which I've quoted from the Elections B.C.
   website (www.elections.bc.ca). Note, paper ballot only marked with a
   pencil:

   Voters who meet the eligibility requirements may vote in an election
   under one of the following opportunities:

   General Voting Day - Voting hours on General Voting Day are from 8 a.m.
   to 8 p.m., Pacific time.

   Advance voting - Advance voting is held from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (local
   time) on the Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday of the week
   preceding General Voting Day. Advance voting is available to any voter
   and all advance voting places are wheelchair accessible.

   Absentee Voting - Voters who are unable to attend their assigned voting
   place on General Voting Day, or the advance voting place(s) in their
   electoral district of residence, may vote at any other voting place in
   the province.

   Alternative Absentee Voting
           An individual may vote by alternative absentee voting if:
           - they expect to be absent from British Columbia on General
   Voting Day
           - they have a physical disability, illness or injury or their
   mobility is impaired, or
           - they will be in a location that is remote from a voting
   place, or will be unable to attend a voting place because of weather or
   other environmental conditions or for another reason beyond the
   individual's control.

       Voters who meet any one of these qualifications can vote in one of
   B.C.'s 91 district electoral offices, or vote by mail using a voting
   package.

   Voting in the district electoral office: Voting in district electoral
   offices between when an election is called and 4 p.m. (Pacific time) on
   General Voting Day.

   Vote by Mail: All B.C. voters may ask for a Vote by Mail package until
   4 p.m. (Pacific time) on General Voting Day (May 14, 2013) by calling
   Elections BC at 1-800-661-8683, or by calling or visiting any district
   electoral office. Each Vote by Mail package includes instructions, a
   ballot, and the envelopes necessary to return the marked ballot and to
   protect the secrecy of the vote. Important: Completed voting packages
   must be returned to the issuing district electoral office before 8 p.m.
   (Pacific time) on General Voting Day. Packages received after that time
   will not be counted.

       Special Voting - The District Electoral Officer may establish
   special voting opportunities to assist eligible voters who wish to vote
   but are unable to attend a regular voting place on General Voting Day
   because they are in a hospital, mental health facility, remote
   community or work camp, long-term care facility or correctional centre.

   Voters needing assistance

   Assistance is available to voters unable to mark a ballot because of a
   physical disability or difficulty with reading or writing. A Voting
   Officer or friend of the voter may mark the voter's ballot in
   accordance with the wishes of the voter. If the voter is assisted by a
   friend, the friend must take an oath of secrecy. A template is
   available at all voting places to allow voters who are visually
   impaired to mark their own ballots if they so choose.

   For further information on Elections BC's accessibility services,
   please view our Meeting Your Needs video for voters with disabilities.

   Voters needing a translator

   The use of a translator is permitted if the voter has difficulty with
   the English language. In areas with large populations of voters who may
   need translators, District Electoral Officers attempt to hire election
   officials who are fluent in the language of the local community.

   BTW, CTV network called Liberal (right of center) majority at 9:27 PM
   with results mostly complete by 11:00 PM on May 14, 2013.
