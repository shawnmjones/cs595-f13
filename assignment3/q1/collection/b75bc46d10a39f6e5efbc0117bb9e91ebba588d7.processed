The Best and the Worst Countries for Sick Children?

   [45]Amie Newman
   September 07, 2011

   According to Save the Children's new [46]health index (PDF) which ranks
   "the best and worst countries for a child to fall sick in," it's the
   presence of health workers that determines a child's chances for
   survival. The poorer the country, the more dangerous it may be for sick
   children.

   Chad and Somalia are the [47]riskiest countries in which to be a sick
   child, while Finland and Switzerland are the safest. The United States
   ranks as the fifteenth safest country.

   What's the correlation between health workers and sick children? Chad
   and Somalia, along with 17 others including Ethopia, Nigeria, and
   Sierra Leone, fall below the World Health Organization's (WHO)
   guidelines for ensuring at least two health workers for every 1000
   people. Given this, it's not hard to see why, as Ben Phillips of Save
   the Children notes in the report, "A child's survival depends on where
   he or she is born in the world."

   In fact, notes the report, a child is five times more likely to die in
   countries with a health worker crisis, than in those that rank higher
   up on the list. With a global shortage of 3.5 million health workers,
   even the most life-saving care - vaccines, care during childbirth,
   treatment for diarrhea and pneumonia -  may be inaccessible in certain
   countries.

     A child's survival depends on where he or she is born in the world.

     Ben Phillips, Save the Children

   The report was released just ahead of a UN meeting, bringing together
   governments from around the world to discuss the [48]health worker
   shortage , and progress on [49]Millennium Development Goals 4 & 5,
   related to child & maternal health.

   The good news is that [50]progress is being made - in countries like
   Bangladesh and Nepal, notes the index, governments have "invested
   wisely in community health workers" and are on track to cut child
   death. Malawi increased its health work by 53 percent, over a five-year
   span, saving 13,000 lives.

   As Gary Darmstadt notes in his [51]post on Impatient Optimists, the
   Government of India recently decided to provide financial incentives to
   accredited social health activists (ASHAs) to provide routine, home
   based care to newborns which has the potential, according to
   evidence, to reduce the number of newborn deaths significantly.

   There is much work to be done but with over 300 groups allied in
   support of the [52]Health Workers Count campaign, there is incredible
   support as well. In just a couple of weeks, global leaders will convene
   in New York City to discuss the progress made, globally, on women's and
   children's health and ways to move forward to continue to save the
   lives of children, no matter where they live in the world.

   Check out Save the Children's [53]index and Health Workers Count for
   more information!
