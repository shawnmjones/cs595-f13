[22]Obama to Congress in weekly address: End the sequester already

     Our top priority as a nation must be growing the economy, creating
     good jobs, and rebuilding opportunity for the middle class.

     But two months ago, Congress allowed a series of automatic budget
     cuts to fall across the federal government that would do the
     opposite. In Washington-speak, these cuts were called the
     "sequester." It was a bad idea then. And as the country saw this
     week, it's a bad idea now.

   President Obama took to the airwaves this morning in his weekly address
   to bemoan the effects of the sequester and to urge adoption of a more
   permanent "balanced approach to deficit reduction."

   In a spirited dig at Congress, the president listed the areas in which
   the sequester is hurting Americans--seniors who depend on
   Meals-on-Wheels, military communities--and yes, air travel, which
   brought forth the observation: "Maybe because they fly home each
   weekend, the Members of Congress who insisted these cuts take hold
   finally realized that they actually apply to them too." And that was
   just mild lead-in to this:

     Republicans claimed victory when the sequester first took effect,
     and now they've decided it was a bad idea all along. Well, first,
     they should look at their own budget. If the cuts they propose were
     applied across the board, the FAA would suffer cuts three times
     deeper.

   The president contrasted the sequester's "Band-Aid approach" to his own
   budget presented a couple of weeks ago, and pressed Congress to act
   with a sense of urgency, even if representatives weren't feeling the
   effects themselves. Obviously, less fortunate Americans are:

     They may not feel the pain felt by kids kicked off Head Start, or
     the 750,000 Americans projected to lose their jobs because of these
     cuts, or the long-term unemployed who will be further hurt by them.
     But that pain is real.

   The bottom line?

     There is only one way to truly fix the sequester: by replacing it
     before it causes further damage.

                      Remarks of President Barack Obama
                               Weekly Address
                               The White House
                               April 27, 2013

     Hi, everybody. Our top priority as a nation must be growing the
     economy, creating good jobs, and rebuilding opportunity for the
     middle class.

     But two months ago, Congress allowed a series of automatic budget
     cuts to fall across the federal government that would do the
     opposite. In Washington-speak, these cuts were called the
     "sequester." It was a bad idea then. And as the country saw this
     week, it's a bad idea now.

     Because of these reckless cuts, there are parents whose kids just
     got kicked out of Head Start programs scrambling for a solution.
     There are seniors who depend on programs like Meals on Wheels to
     live independently looking for help. There are military communities
     - families that have already sacrificed enough - coping under new
     strains.  All because of these cuts.

     This week, the sequester hurt travelers, who were stuck for hours in
     airports and on planes, and rightly frustrated by it. And, maybe
     because they fly home each weekend, the Members of Congress who
     insisted these cuts take hold finally realized that they actually
     apply to them too.

     Republicans claimed victory when the sequester first took effect,
     and now they've decided it was a bad idea all along. Well, first,
     they should look at their own budget. If the cuts they propose were
     applied across the board, the FAA would suffer cuts three times
     deeper.

     So Congress passed a temporary fix. A Band-Aid. But these cuts are
     scheduled to keep falling across other parts of the government that
     provide vital services for the American people. And we can't just
     keep putting Band-Aids on every cut. It's not a responsible way to
     govern. There is only one way to truly fix the sequester: by
     replacing it before it causes further damage.

     A couple weeks ago, I put forward a budget that replaces the next
     several years of these dumb cuts with smarter cuts; reforms our tax
     code to close wasteful special interest loopholes; and invests in
     things like education, research, and manufacturing that will create
     new jobs right now.

     So I hope Members of Congress will find the same sense of urgency
     and bipartisan cooperation to help the families still in the
     crosshairs of these cuts. They may not feel the pain felt by kids
     kicked off Head Start, or the 750,000 Americans projected to lose
     their jobs because of these cuts, or the long-term unemployed who
     will be further hurt by them. But that pain is real.

     The American people worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from
     one economic crisis just to see your elected officials keep causing
     more. Our economy is growing. Our deficits are shrinking. We're
     creating jobs on a consistent basis. But we need to do more to help
     middle-class families get ahead, and give more folks a chance to
     earn their way into the middle class. And we can, if we work
     together. That's what you expect. That's what I'm going to work
     every single day to help deliver. Thank you.

                                     ###

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health

   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       But the Democrats are no better on that score. After all, they fall
       over backwards to help the Republicans tie their hands while
       whining about the obstruction.
       Our government is broken. From what I've been reading, it's the
       predictable end-game of a Petrostate, even a declining one such as
       the U.S.
       Frankly, I'd rather take down Exxon or Goldman Sachs, the way we're

 "no better?" ([131]0+ / 0-)

   Every GOP House member voted against the Stimulus bill in 2009. Only 11
   Democrats voted against. In the Senate all Democrats voted for; only 3
   Republicans voted for. This is pattern is typical. The GOP is a very
   disciplined opposition that has Tea Party voters constantly pushing it.
   If you give Democrats no credit you are really helpiing Republicans by
   discouraging other voters. Look at your own members of Congress. If
   they are Democrats, how do they vote? Next year you can vote in the
   primary. Right now you can explore your options, encourage a primary
   opponent if that is what you need.

   Censorship is rogue government.

       and the rest save face. And they take turns looking bad to their
       constituents.
       There's no number of Democrats that would break this spell. The
       number that the plutocrats need to influence for any particular
       vote requiring 60 (i.e., ALL of them) will always be manageable.
       One of the few fronts where this pattern seems breakable is federal
       GLBT rights.

       Due to the conservatism of the native population and two egregious
       rounds of gerrymandering, the only Democrat who's won a federal
       seat has been Jim Matheson, who is about 75% Republican. That won't
       be changing any time soon. They almost certainly will get at least
       one more round of gerrymandering before the minority population
       start having a real impact. And by then, no doubt the voter
       suppression techniques will have expanded enough to give them
       another round after that...
       Outside of Salt Lake County and a couple of other pockets, the
       Democratic Party has little future in Utah. And most of the
       Democrats here could run as Republicans elsewhere.

 Conspiracy theory ([151]0+ / 0-)
       Taking turns to let Republicans win?
       The stimulus bill passed both houses, at a time when both houses
       had Democratic majorities. This was an illustration of how
       disciplined the GOP can be, the Democratic Party less so.
       We Kossacks do not have the track record of winning primaries that

   is to protect its citizens from abuse. Secular or religious.

   The Writers of the Constitution were in our situation. Sucked dry by
   corporate greed and warring religions, with a king who favored
   corporations over subjects.

   If the government really wanted to create jobs, it would move its
   contracted functions  back in-house.  Cut out the leech middleman.

       Outside of GLBT rights, our progressive representation is limited

       He will NEVER be an effective leader for the goals he claims to
       have in this speech until he effectively confronts and denounces
       those aspects of modern neoliberalism that enhance the lawless,

   3-5 exceptions, is broken. We agree. But you say this as if that
   excuses the President from representing the 98% in action as well as
   words (and in the case of the latter, he is not consistent, except that
   he consistently gives credence to the corrupt form of neoliberalism

   words--such as the ones he spoke this morning--that intimate he would

   The widespread corruption and deliberate ineffectiveness of the

   The only moral and rational course of action, in my opinion, is to
   repeal sequestration.  Full stop.

   Don't replace it with a "balanced" plan of taking pennies from the rich
   and dollars from the poor.  Don't create a morally repulsive zero-sum
   game in which one program's gain is another program's loss.

   John Conyers already has a bill--an easy one sentence bill--to repeal
   sequestration.  The President could easily support it.  But, as we
   know, he won't.

   Sequestration was an awful plan designed by the White House to counter
   another awful plan by the House Republicans and to force Democrats to
   accept cuts to Social Security and Medicare and Republicans to accept
   tax increases.

   Also, Obama's budget (surprise, surprise!) saves the Pentagon from much
   of its sequestration cuts by shifting those over to Social Security and
   Medicare.  Because, you know, he really cares about the little guy.

       As long as the GOP is unwilling to agree to tax revenue increases

     A couple weeks ago, I put forward a budget that replaces the next

       It took a few years for those scales to fall from my eyes.  If you
       take his utterances at face value, he sounds great.  If you start
       reading between the lines, the truth actually emerges.
       The core truth of his 2d term is that he wants a Grand Bargain for
       the sake of achieving a Grand Bargain.  The actual terms of the
       bargain are generally secondary to achieving it.  The only
       essential terms that I see are cutting "entitlements" and getting
       some sort of tax increases on the top end.
       Am I the only one who finds it odd that the Estate Tax was largely
       gutted at the start of this year, but chaining CPI for SS is now
       essential?  Rich old people need to be able to bequeath more to

   [947]Blast from the Past:

     Similarly, President Obama has revealed his real preferences in the
     current blame game by not calling for a clean bill eliminating the
     Sequester. It is striking that as far as I know (1) neither Obama
     nor any administration official has called for the elimination of
     the Sequester and (2) we have a fairly silly blame game about how
     the Sequester was created without discussing the implications of
     Obama's continuing failure to call for the elimination of the
     Sequester despite his knowledge that it is highly self-destructive.

     The only logical inference that can be drawn is that Obama remains
     committed to inflicting the "Grand Bargain" (really, the Grand
     Betrayal) on the Nation in his quest for a "legacy" and continues to
     believe that the Sequester provides him the essential leverage he
     feels he needs to coerce Senate progressives to adopt austerity,
     make deep cuts in vital social programs, and to begin to unravel the
     safety net. Obama's newest budget offer includes cuts to the safety
     net and provides that 2/3 of the austerity inflicted would consist
     of spending cuts instead of tax increases. When that package is
     one's starting position the end result of any deal will be far
     worse.

     In any event, there is a clear answer to how to help our Nation.
     Both Parties should agree tomorrow to do a clean deal eliminating
     the Sequester without any conditions. By doing so, Obama would
     demonstrate that he had no desire to inflict the Grand Betrayal.

   No one cares about what he says, least of all the legislators in

   roll out of Obamacare allowing them to retake the Senate and expand in
   the House. Why would they care about another speech? Whether or not
   Obama means well he's politically as powerless a President as we've
   seen since the last act of Watergate.

   Nobody's listening to you, Mr. President.  It's clear you're not
   leading, i.e., you're a follower.

   These politicians are only concerned with their inconvenience and only
   hear the voices of airline CEO's.  Just marvel at the speed of this
   reversal of the sequester BECAUSE it only affects those with income
   enough to fly, not the majority of the working class, poor and elderly.

   the President's integrity but he has no credibility.

   Not just with his handling of the old budget debate, which created the
   sequester, the fiscal cliff negotiation, the actual sequester, his
   Social Security cuts / Grand Bargain, and the recent gutting of the
   Stock Act, as just some of the more recently memorable treasons against
   the general welfare, but also because of his [1148]Trans-Pacific
   Partnership "trade policy," a massive, underhanded, destructive effort
   eradicate what is left of national sovereignty, democracy, labor rights
   leverage and economic justice in the face of corporatocracy /
   plutocracy /oligarchy; his catastrophic all-of-the-above energy policy,
   his broad, brazen assault on government transparency, whistleblowing,
   the Bill of Rights, privacy, and international law; his thorough
   complicity in the resuscitation of the hegemony of a brazenly corrupt,
   fraudulent financial sector, the supply-side code, and neoliberalism in
   lieu of establishing a robust Mixed Economy to bring justice to white
   collar crime, reverse the hyper-concentration of income and wealth, and
   prevent future financial rape by Wall Street. And I could go on.

   His credibility is gone and his current actions and inactions, not
   words, demonstrate that he has no interest in doing what it would take
   to restore it.

   Frankly, I'd rather take down Exxon or Goldman Sachs, the way we're
   taking down RushBeckistan, than elect another "better" Democrat who's
   going to wind up singing for the bankster choir.

   It's not "the Congress" or "Members of Congress" ...

   He should be saying "REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS"

   He said the word "Republicans" once in the 3 minute speech,

   I was actually flying (and using in-flight internet) when I read the
   news about Congress voting to exempt the FAA and I was incensed. I
   couldn't believe that Congress would be so transparent and brazen about
   whom they really represent.  I don't care about an hour delay for my
   flights.  I do care about public housing, meals on wheels, and how real
   people who depend on government (and the economy which depends on these
   folks as well)  are impacted by these petty, feckless Republicans whose
   only agenda is to keep the black guy in the White House from being
   successful.

   That's what this is all about....jealousy and racism.  I was also
   reminded of Paul Krugman's recent article about the collapse of
   austerity's philosophical and statistical underpinnings, and he made
   the point that the reason a failed theory still has relevance in DC is
   because DC represents the elites.  It is class warfare at its worst.

   In the 90's, the GOP did everything possible to frustrate the Clinton
   administration because they just didn't like Bill and what he
   represented generationally.  They've updated the tactics against Obama,
   because of what he represents generationally, demographically and
   historically.

   I do not agree with signing this piece of crap legislation exempting
   the FAA.  No one's cuts should be lifted until everyone's are lifted.
   That's the only way to get the GOP to end this pursuit of austerian
   futility.

   the President should plan to print $1 trillion. If it makes sense as a

   about what this would do:

   1) Reduce savings by about 1/15
   2) Reduce all debt by about 1/15
   3) Raise interest rates on future savings and debt
   4) Cause some single-digit inflation, forcing companies to spend their
   cash hoards
   5) Increase the cost of the national debt -- so part of the cash should
   go to pay it down
