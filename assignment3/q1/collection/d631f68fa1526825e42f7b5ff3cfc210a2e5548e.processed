Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty (Book Review)

     Normally, I'm fairly positive about the books I review, but here's
     one I really took issue with.

   Why have some countries prospered and created great living conditions
   for their citizens, while others have not? This is a topic I care a lot
   about, so I was eager to pick up a book recently on exactly this topic.

   Why Nations Fail is easy to read, with lots of interesting historical
   stories about different countries. It makes an argument that is
   appealingly simple: countries with "inclusive" (rather than
   "extractive") political and economic institutions are the ones that
   succeed and survive over the long term.

   Ultimately, though, the book is a major disappointment. I found the
   authors' analysis vague and simplistic. Beyond their "inclusive vs.
   extractive" view of political and economic institutions, they largely
   dismiss all other factors--history and logic notwithstanding. Important
   terms aren't really defined, and they never explain how a country can
   move to have more "inclusive" institutions.

   For example, the book goes back in history to talk about economic
   growth during Roman times. The problem with this is that before 800AD,
   the economy everywhere was based on sustenance farming. So the fact
   that various Roman government structures were more or less inclusive
   did not affect growth.

   The authors demonstrate an oddly simplistic world view when they
   attribute the decline of Venice to a reduction in the inclusiveness of
   its institutions. The fact is, Venice declined because competition came
   along. The change in the inclusiveness of its institutions was more a
   response to that than the source of the problem. Even if Venice had
   managed to preserve the inclusiveness of their institutions, it would
   not have made up for their loss of the spice trade. When a book tries
   to use one theory to explain everything, you get illogical examples
   like this.

   Another surprise was the authors' view of the decline of the Mayan
   civilization. They suggest that infighting--which showed a lack of
   inclusiveness--explains the decline. But that overlooks the primary
   reason: the weather and water availability reduced the productivity of
   their agricultural system, which undermined Mayan leaders' claims to be
   able to bring good weather.

   The authors believe that political "inclusiveness" must come first,
   before growth is achievable. Yet, most examples of economic growth in
   the last 50 years-the Asian miracles of Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, and
   Singapore-took place when their political tended more toward
   exclusiveness.

   When faced with so many examples where this is not the case, they
   suggest that growth is not sustainable where "inclusiveness" does not
   exist. However, even under the best conditions, growth doesn't sustain
   itself. I don't think even these authors would suggest that the Great
   Depression, Japan's current malaise, or the global financial crisis of
   the last few years came about because of a decline in inclusiveness.

   The authors ridicule "modernization theory"-which observes that
   sometimes a strong leader can make the right choices to help a country
   grow, and then there is a good chance the country will evolve to have
   more "inclusive" politics. Korea and Taiwan are examples of where this
   has occurred.

   The book also overlooks the incredible period of growth and innovation
   in China between 800 and 1400. During this 600-year period, China had
   the most dynamic economy in the world and drove a huge amount of
   innovation, such as advanced iron smelting and ship building. As
   several well-regarded authors have pointed out, this had nothing to do
   with how "inclusive" China was, and everything to do with geography,
   timing, and competition among empires.

   The authors have a problem with Modern China because the transition
   from Mao Zedong to Deng Xiaoping didn't involve a change to make
   political institutions more inclusive. Yet, China, by most measures,
   has been a miracle of sustained economic growth. I think almost
   everyone agrees that China needs to change its politics to be more
   inclusive. But there are hundreds of millions of Chinese whose
   lifestyle has been radically improved in recent years, who would
   probably disagree that their growth was "extractive." I am far more
   optimistic than the authors that continued gradual change, without
   instability, will continue to move China in the right direction.

   The incredible economic transition in China over the last three-plus
   decades occurred because the leadership embraced capitalistic
   economics, including private property, markets, and investing in
   infrastructure and education.

   This points to the most obvious theory about growth, which is that it
   is strongly correlated with embracing capitalistic
   economics--independent of the political system. When a country focuses
   on getting infrastructure built and education improved, and it uses
   market pricing to determine how resources should be allocated, then it
   moves towards growth. This test has a lot more clarity than the one
   proposed by the authors, and seems to me fits the facts of what has
   happened over time far better.

   The authors end with a huge attack on foreign aid, saying that most of
   the time, less than 10% gets to the intended recipients. They cite
   Afghanistan as an example, which is misleading since Afghanistan is a
   war zone and aid was ramped up very quickly with war-related goals.
   There is little doubt this is the least effective foreign aid, but it
   is hardly a fair example.

   As an endnote, I should mention that the book refers to me in a
   positive light, comparing how I made money to how Carlos Slim made his
   fortune in Mexico. Although I appreciate the nice thoughts, I think the
   book is quite unfair to Slim. Almost certainly, the competition laws in
   Mexico need strengthening, but I am sure that Mexico is much better off
   with Slim's contribution in running businesses well than it would be
   without him.
