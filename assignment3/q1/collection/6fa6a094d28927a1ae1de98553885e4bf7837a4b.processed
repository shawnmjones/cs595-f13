   [60]Terry Gilliam has praised Seth MacFarlane's animated comedy Family
   Guy, saying that it's "the only television I actually watch these
   days".
   Gilliam and his Monty Python co-stars Terry Jones, Michael Palin and
   Carol Cleveland spoke to Digital Spy about their favourite modern
   comedies at the launch of their Monty Python's Flying Circus Python
   Bytes app.
   "I think Family Guy is absolutely brilliant," Gilliam said. "Like any
   comedy it's going to be up and down, but when it hits the mark it's the
   most outrageous and outspoken, non-PC wonderful stuff."
   Cleveland, who appeared in 30 of the 45 Monty Python's Flying Circus TV
   episodes, admitted that she had a love for dark comedy such as Michael
   C Hall's Six Feet Under.
   Palin revealed that he is a fan of Hall's FX show Dexter: "To laugh at
   someone who's a mass-murderer? I don't know how they do it. I am
   tickled by that, as I am by Twenty Twelve."
