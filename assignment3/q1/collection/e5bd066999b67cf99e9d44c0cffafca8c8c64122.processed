[22]While You Were Out: Virginia Senate Republicans pull redistricting coup

   Virginia State Capitol (source: [29]Wikipedia)
   [30]Blue Virginia:

     You don't get more slimy, sneaky, underhanded, etc. than [31]this
     (great work by Ben Tribbett alerting us to what was going on in the
     following series of Facebook updates):

     "Wow- Republicans in the Virginia Senate are now trying to redraw
     the maps and draw at least one Democratic Senator out of the Senate.
     Happening right now on the floor."

     "COUP GOING ON IN VIRGINIA SENATE: Republicans have just brought all
     new Senate districts to the floor with Henry Marsh gone in DC, now
     30 minutes of debate before they send them to the House of
     Delegates."

     "COUP SUCCESSFUL- NEW DISTRICTS HEADED TO VIRGINIA HOUSE. AT LEAST
     ONE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR TO BE OUSTED."

   Take note, too, of this update to that post:

     UPDATE #2: One of the sharpest Virginia political analysts I know,
     [32]KentonNgo, tweets: "If VA Republicans were smart enough not to
     touch the already cleared VRA districts, the plan will likely stand.
     Dems are toast." Ugh.

   Here's the [33]Richmond Times-Dispatch on the matter.

   Better local minds than mine will have to be our guide on what, if
   anything, there is to do here, besides go to court. But this did bring
   up a thought.

   Today, the Virginia Senate Republicans play all out constitutional
   hardball on the rules. And tomorrow, Republicans will be pleading with
   Democrats for a "go slow" approach, bipartisan compromise, or just
   shrieking "power grab!" when the U.S. Senate takes up filibuster
   reform.

   They're pissing on your leg and telling you it's raining, senators.
   Look alive.

   [34]Please send an email to your Democratic senator/s urging them to
   pass real filibuster reform including the talking filibuster and/or
   flipping the burden.

   If you don't have a Democratic senator, call Reid's office at
   202-224-3542, and tell him to include the talking filibuster and/or
   flipping the burden of the filibuster.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [48]Tagging tips - [49]Search For Tags - [50]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   when one Dem had the audacity to be in Washington, DC, for the
   inauguration and thus this made the situation a 20-19 vote so that the
   Lt.Gov, who states that he would have voted against it, wouldn't have
   had to vote.

     The action drew strong criticism from Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling (R), who
     decides tie votes in the Senate and would have been in a position to
     kill the measure if Republicans hadn't chosen to spring it on a day
     when one Democrat was absent. Sen. Henry L. Marsh III (D-Richmond)
     was attending President Obama's inauguration. [162]WashPost

 Sorry, no sympathy ([168]0+ / 0-)
       I have no sympathy for Virginia Democrats.  When are Democrats
       going to realize that the Republicans are playing for keeps.  If
       Marsh doesn't want to represent his district, he needs to step
       aside.  Then he can go to Washington as often as he likes.
       I am not defending the Republicans' actions because they are
       indefensible, but it is way too late in the day to be surprised by
       what Republicans are capable of doing.

 Hmmm ... ([172]0+ / 0-)
       Not sure that I fully agree  but need to think about it.  There are
       lots of broken 'rules' in this game that make it questionable
       whether the move will stand up.
       Agree that we need to understand that Republicans know how to and
       are willing to play dirty.

       Noting that the federal constitution only sets a minimum
       requirement for redistricting Congressional seats every 10 years,
       following each census, he quite correctly pointed out that it
       doesn't say you can't redistrict more often than that.
       This, of course, involves the Virginia constitution, not the
       federal one. But the concept may be much the same.

       They can't write someone out of their district, they can only set

 GOP in Blue States - Electoral Votes by District ([367]0+ / 0-)
       It could get much worse.
       Obvious partisan machinations like these could be in preparation
       for changing to awarding Virginia's electoral votes by
       congressional district winner. These moves should add support for
       the National Popular Vote movement. If the party in control in each
       state is tempted every 2, 4, or 10 years (post-census) to consider
       rewriting election laws and redistrict with an eye to the likely
       politically beneficial effects for their party in the next
       presidential election, then the National Popular Vote system, in
       which all voters across the country are guaranteed to be
       politically relevant and treated equally, looks better and better.
       The National Popular Vote bill would guarantee the Presidency to
       the candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states
       (and DC).
       Every vote, everywhere, would be politically relevant and equal in
       presidential elections.
       When the bill is enacted by states with a majority of the electoral
       votes- enough electoral votes to elect a President (270 of 538),
       all the electoral votes from the enacting states would be awarded
       to the presidential candidate who receives the most popular votes
       in the country.
       The presidential election system that we have today was not
       designed, anticipated, or favored by the Founding Fathers but,
       instead, is the product of decades of evolutionary change
       precipitated by the emergence of political parties and enactment by
       48 states of winner-take-all laws, not mentioned, much less
       endorsed, in the Constitution.
       The bill uses the power given to each state by the Founding Fathers
       in the Constitution to change how they award their electoral votes
       for President. Historically, virtually all of the major changes in
       the method of electing the President, including ending the
       requirement that only men who owned substantial property could vote
       and 48 current state-by-state winner-take-all laws, have come about
       by state legislative action.
       A survey of Virginia voters showed 74% overall support for a
       national popular vote for President.
       By age, support for a national popular vote was 82% among 18-29
       year olds, 75% among 30-45 year olds, 75% among 46-65 year olds,
       and 68% for those older than 65.
       By gender, support was 82% among women and 65% among men.
       By political affiliation, support was 79% for a national popular
       vote among liberal Democrats (representing 17% of respondents), 86%
       among moderate Democrats (representing 21% of respondents), 79%
       among conservative Democrats (representing 10% of respondents), 76%
       among liberal Republicans (representing 4% of respondents), 63%
       among moderate Republicans (representing 14% of respondents), and
       54% among conservative Republicans (representing 17% of
       respondents), and 79% among Others.
       In Gallup polls since 1944, only about 20% of the public has
       supported the current system of awarding all of a state's electoral
       votes to the presidential candidate who receives the most votes in
       each separate state (with about 70% opposed and about 10%
       undecided). Support for a national popular vote is strong among
       Republicans, Democrats, and Independent voters, as well as every
       demographic group in virtually every state surveyed in recent polls
       in recent closely divided Battleground states: CO - 68%, FL - 78%,
       IA 75%, MI - 73%, MO - 70%, NH - 69%, NV - 72%, NM- 76%, NC - 74%,
       OH - 70%, PA - 78%, VA - 74%, and WI - 71%; in Small states (3 to 5
       electoral votes): AK - 70%, DC - 76%, DE - 75%, ID - 77%, ME - 77%,
       MT - 72%, NE 74%, NH - 69%, NV - 72%, NM - 76%, OK - 81%, RI - 74%,
       SD - 71%, UT - 70%, VT - 75%, WV - 81%, and WY - 69%; in Southern
       and Border states: AR - 80%, KY- 80%, MS - 77%, MO - 70%, NC - 74%,
       OK - 81%, SC - 71%, TN - 83%, VA - 74%, and WV - 81%; and in other
       states polled: AZ - 67%, CA - 70%, CT - 74%, MA - 73%, MN - 75%, NY
       - 79%, OR - 76%, and WA - 77%. Americans believe that the candidate
       who receives the most votes should win.
       The bill has passed 31 state legislative chambers in 21 states with
       243 electoral votes. The bill has been enacted by 9 jurisdictions
       with 132 electoral votes - 49% of the 270 necessary to go into
       effect.

       was a law partner of [433]Oliver Hill

     Oliver White Hill earned his undergraduate degree from Howard
     University and entered Howard University School of Law in 1930. He
     studied under the tutelage of Charles Hamilton Houston, the chief
     architect in challenging Jim Crow laws through legal means. In law
     school, Hill was a classmate and close friend of future Supreme
     Court Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall. He graduated second in
     his class after Marshall in 1933.
     ....

     In the early 1950s, Hill was co-counsel with Spottswood W. Robinson
     III in dozens of civil rights lawsuits around Virginia. In 1951, he
     took up the cause of the African American students at the segregated
     R.R. Moton High School in Farmville who had walked out of their
     dilapidated school. The subsequent lawsuit, Davis v. County School
     Board of Prince Edward County later became one of the five cases
     decided under Brown v. Board of Education before the Supreme Court
     of the United States in 1954.
       Hill died in 2007 at age 100.

 Boycott the South.... ([437]0+ / 0-)

   Not only are these states conservative, they are increasingly becoming
   dangerous, as more of their citizens stockpile guns.

   I know that this is a tall, probably impossible goal.  I nevertheless
   remember how African American groups urged boycotts of states that
   refused to treat MLK Day as a holiday.

   These states need to be treated like the pariahs they are.  Talk about
   takers.  Chris Christie was right.  Northern states like NJ are the
   MAKERS.  They give the federal government more money than they receive.
    Most southern states are TAKERS.  They take more from the federal
   government than they give.

   If you're a Southerner on this website, I suggest you head North, with
   the rest of the progressives.  Yes, I know that you may value your
   "southern ancestry."  Well let me tell you, part of my family is from
   GERMANY.  Years ago, my German ancestors ditched a country that was
   then rotten, sick and racist and became progressive AMERICANS.

   It is now time for progressive Southerners to ditch the rotten, sick
   and racist South and move North, so that you can live a real American.

   My solutions are strident, radical, and may be considered obnoxious to
   some.  I just can't see any other alternative.

   I understand your frustration - I grew up agnostic in southeast
   Virginia, and it wasn't all that easy. It would have been a lot harder
   if I were black and/or LGBT. We had race-based shooting incidents in my
   town's high school parking lot as recently as the late '80s.

   Nonetheless, most of the conservatives I met there (60/40 R/D ratio)
   were decent human beings, and were willing to give me a fair shot once
   they saw me as a person and not just as a nonreligious Other. I've seen
   attitudes change dramatically in twenty years, especially with regards
   to the LGBT community. Virginia voted for Obama twice. Slowly but
   surely, Virginia is evolving, and the Deep South will follow.

   And that's why I think your remedies are misguided. Instead of writing
   off half the country (a la Mitt Romney) and saying they aren't "real
   Americans" (a la George Allen), how about working to change attitudes?
   I know it's tempting, and easy, to say "ditch the rotten, sick, and
   racist South," but it's wrong.

   take redistricting out of the hands of the legislature.

   Create an independent redistricting commission to create competitive
   districts.  Arizona is climbing out of rightwing crazy status little by
   little now as a result of minimal gerrymandering.

       The Commission was formed by the passage of Proposition 106 by the
   people of Arizona in the 2000 General Election. Proposition 106 amends
   the Arizona Constitution to create a five-member commission to redraw
   Congressional and Legislative district boundaries following the 2000
   Census. Previously, the State Legislature was responsible for redrawing
   the lines. Many people believed this practice resulted in boundaries
   that served the politicians instead of the people of Arizona. The
   five-member Redistricting Commission acts independently of the State
   Legislature.

   This year we gained four legislative senate seats and six legislative
   house seats.  Republicans still have a majority, but not a
   supermajority.  They will have to make deals with Dems to pass
   legislation.  We also sent 5 Democrats to the House out of 8
   congressional seats.

   Republicans in the legislature have kicked and screamed and dragged the
   commission into court several times, but the commission has prevailed,
   and we're better for it.
