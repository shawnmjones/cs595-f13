[22]Rep. Mike Kelly sees a black president who 'divides us on race'

   U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during a campaign rally at Ohio
   University in Athens, Ohio, October 17, 2012. Obama is campaigning in
   Iowa and Ohio on Wednesday following the second presidential debate
   against Mitt Romney on October 16. &nbsp;REUTERS/Jason
   What do you see? Mike Kelly sees something different.
   The Roll Call reporter in this piece is charitably pretending that they
   do not speak wingnut, so allow me to [29]do the translation:

     Republican Rep. Mike Kelly unleashed a diatribe on President Barack
     Obama on Friday, at one point saying he "divides us on race."

   He means the president is black.

     "This week I heard the president talk about phony scandals. There's
     nothing phonier than the words that have come out of 1600
     Pennsylvania Ave. about reuniting this country, bringing us together
     as a people," the Pennsylvania Republican said at a news conference
     Friday. "No, he's not a uniter; he's a divider. He divides us on
     race, he divides us on income. He picks winners and losers."

   He means the president is black and once or twice has talked about
   being black, and also something something tax policy I don't like
   something something.

     Speaking with CQ Roll Call following the event, Kelly did not
     elaborate on what he meant in calling Obama a divider on issues of
     race.

   HE MEANS THE PRESIDENT IS A BLACK GUY.

     "Listen, I'll tell you what: It's self-evident," Kelly said. "I
     don't know if people who aren't reading or not watching, maybe,
     don't have the same opinion, but I think it's pretty obvious where
     we're going with some of this stuff.

   The president a black guy, and it's self-evident that the president is
   a black guy. If you can't see it, Mike Kelly thinks maybe you're not
   one of Mike Kelly's people and ain't gonna go into it any further, but
   everyone Mike Kelly knows is pretty damn aware that the president is a
   black guy and so he's a bit surprised you can't just see it.

     "I think watching him pretty much leads to a conclusion," he
     continued. "I don't know if I can do it any better than the way he
     does it."

   At this point Mike Kelly devolved into an elaborate semaphore-and-dance
   routine premised on the notion of oh my god why are you not seeing how
   damn black that guy is and how divisive that is, in Mike Kelly's
   version of America.

   Whenever Barack Obama talks about race in America, some halfwit like
   Mike Kelly pops up to tell us that Barack Obama is stoking racial
   tensions. Whenever Barack Obama talks even offhandedly about class in
   America, some guy like Mike Kelly slithers his way to a nearby camera
   to tell us that Barack Obama is inciting one class against the other.
   Good people of Mike Kelly's standing know, and will say aloud, that
   racism in America was well on the mend until the Black Guy got elected
   and started being not-white, obviously and self-evidently not-white,
   thus pissing off people like Mike Kelly who believe that racism and
   classism and the plight of the poor and the increasing divide between
   the powerful and the not-powerful and the rest of that stuff is not
   nearly so bad as the mean-spirited audacity of someone, somewhere,
   mentioning any of those things as bad.

   More, below the fold:

   Still with me? Ahem.

   There is a reason why the map of places Barack Obama did or did not win
   in 2008 looked rather remarkably like the map of places where American
   racism is still at its most frothy and paranoid. There is a reason why
   John McCain, born in Panama, was subject to zero prominent theories as
   to his foreignness but Barack Obama, born in Hawaii, has been the focus
   of years of elaborate, prominent conspiracies as to his true "origins"
   and the possible wide-ranging plots that inexorably worked from the
   first moments of his existence to carry him through maniacal handlers
   and mentors and fixers necessary to place the little tot in the White
   House. There is a reason there have been laws conspicuously
   contemplated in various redneck states to increase the necessary
   paperwork needed before one can be put on the ballot as presidential
   material, specifically the need to show one's birth paperwork to every
   last local official in every last separate jurisdiction who might be,
   shall we say, suspicious of your alleged American-ness and need to
   conduct their own little inquiry as to your credibility.

   There is a reason why, ever since Barack Obama came into office,
   conservative kingmaker and thought leader Rush Limbaugh has devoted the
   near-entirety of his radio career to incessant lectures on how Barack
   Obama is black, how Barack Obama dislikes white people to the point of
   irrationality, and how everything Barack Obama does is based on hurting
   white people to the benefit of black people, speeches all sandwiched
   between general racial bile, such as observations on whether or not he
   can say "nigga," that would get anyone who was not the guiding light of
   conservative say-so fired many years ago. It has not gotten him fired.
   His increasingly outrageous rhetoric has caused corporate sponsorships
   to vanish at a rapid pace, but his standing in the party has been
   reduced by considerably smaller increments.

   There is a reason why conspiracy theories, specifically conspiracy
   theories about lily-white conservatives and their ammunition, have
   continued to rocket into prominence, and why they have been actually
   cited and worried over by credulous conservative lawmakers despite no
   actual evidence that might support any of them. There is a reason many
   of these conspiracies suppose a secret non-white military force under
   Obama's direction, and a reason why groups like ACORN that
   conspicuously assist minorities have been elevated to Illuminati-level
   conspirators. There is a reason why presumptions that the United
   Nations is always just a mere two feet from the American border,
   waiting to pounce just as soon as the American president gives his say
   so, has worked its way loose from its batshit insane John Birchian
   origins and is now something third-tier city councils write
   earnest-sounding declarations about, and why we cannot have nice things
   like bike trails or efficient lighting because that all ties into the
   United Nations plan.

   There is a reason why there is a heavy price to be paid for a supposed
   conservative seen as working with the president even to the most
   piddling degree, to the point that even the most basic functions of
   government can no longer be managed no matter how much actual harm not
   managing them continues do. There is a reason why the healthcare
   position demanded by conservatives during the last Democratic
   administration has been decreed to be unconstitutional by every two-bit
   hack who once wrote a policy paper declaring the opposite.

   There is a reason why a tanning-bed tax meant to pinpoint a specific
   known health vice is loudly declared to be evidence of racist intent on
   the part of government because [30]only white people need tanning beds.

   Most of all, there's a reason that the 2010 elections saw a motivated
   Republican electorate so dedicated to an organized crapping of the
   pants at the terrifying president and his scary scary divisive
   lukewarm-centrism that they were willing to vote every last crackpot
   into office, including past rejects like Steve Stockman and people
   whose sparse Wikipedia biographies spend [31]more time taking about
   their high school football career than whatever scraps of past
   political experience might have qualified them for their new job
   howling at the conservative moon. It's not about the tea party sector
   of the American public suddenly discovering that, by golly, they didn't
   feel like paying their taxes on Barack Obama's inauguration day after
   all, though that was certainly a lovely coincidence. No, it is about
   Barack Obama dividing people.

   So how is Obama doing it? You wouldn't know, reader. You can either see
   it or you can't, and if you can't see it then you're just not the sort
   of person Mike Kelly spends his days catering to.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [50]Tagging tips - [51]Search For Tags - [52]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Now my brainwashed relatives are sending out e-mails how the "evil
       black man" is going to hand the Presidency over to a "godless
       Marxist lesbian".
       These brainwashed relatives love to boast about their "deep
       Christian faith" on Facebook. The same time they post bullshit
       about their faith, they add racist post after post about the
       "Godless Black Marxist Muslim coming for their Guns".
       Which is why I finally cut my family off. I want nothing to do with
       them. 30 years ago, they were all hard core Democrats, but one by
       one, the Religious Right, Fox News, Rush and his Right wing hate
       peddlers got to them. All of them now bullshit about their "deep
       Christian faith" but in reality, all they do every Sunday is bow
       down before a Golden Elephant and get the latest Republican talking
       points from their pulpit pimps.

   It's sad to realize that there is a certain segment of the population
   which is unwilling and unable to accept change.

   In doing so they retreat into a cave of fear unable to face a changing

     "Listen, I'll tell you what: It's self-evident," Kelly said.
       I have seen people trying to build cred from conflict (not positive
       change) use this argument in South Dakota to basically shut down
       the discussion. The argument along the lines of: "If you don't see
       the race problem here [x situation], there's not really much point
       in talking to you about it."
       I've seen this from both White and Native and political animals of

 The MOST Divisive President -- since GWB ([589]0+ / 0-)
       Hey ... Dubya was almost ten years ago ... that's a lifetime in
       Media Years ...
       And before that ?
       Well, Abraham Lincoln wasn't much of a Uniter, there, was he?  And
       before HIM, that Jackson fellah was a bit of a Class Warrior in his
       own right.
       But from Grant to the First Roosevelt, Presidents were Presidents
       ... they PRESIDED -- and left governance to those rich enough and
       wise enough to do it properly.
       Then Class Traitor Roosevelt   (Theodore, not Franklin) read some
       Upton Sinclair and the next thing you know:  DIVISIVE Trust Busting
       and divisive Pure Food and Drug Laws.   But TR spent  his one  term
       attacking Big Business   then skipped off to Africa to shoot Big
       Game.
       Taft put the Nation back on track, reunified behind Business and
       Banking  -- where it STAYED until Franklin started mixing in where
       he wasn't wanted.
       Then everything went to hell in a hand basket ...
       The Reich surrendered,  and Eisenhower started bad-mouthing the Job
       Creating Military Industrial Complex.  D I V I S I V E ! !
       Kennedy began his divisive flirtation  with Civil Rights
       legislation and deescalation of the Cold War
       And Johnson got a LOT of divisive economic and racial legislation
       passed ... while escalating the Vietnam War -- REALLY dividing the
       Nation.
       And while, today, Nixon could run as a DLC Democrat, in his day ...
       well, opinion was strongly divided over the man's character and
       competence -- and whether colluding with the Diem regime to
       sabotage the Paris Peace talks constituted "treason" ... or just
       smart electoral strategy.
       Presidents 38-42 were a pretty boring and non controversial bunch
       -- unless you want to remember the Clinton Impeachment and the
       whole "murder of Vince Foster" thingie.
       And then Education President Bush, became War President Bush II ...
       and whaddayahknow -- more Division.
       But ... as long as you don't look back too far -- Barack H.
       (wink,wink)  Obama is the Most. Divisive. President. Ever !!
       You sort of wonder about the cost-effectiveness of teaching any
       history at all in Secondary School, when you realize that half the
       students will grow up to be Republican Base -- and can just write
       their own.

     August 1, 2012: A date that will live in infamy. Or so some
     religious conservatives contend. Matt Smith, president of the
     Catholic Advocate, solemnly declared that "August first will be
     remembered as the day our most cherished liberty was thrown in a
     government dumpster and hauled away." L. Brent Bozell III, president
     of the conservative Media Research Center, inveighed that "the
     beginning of the end of freedom as America has known it and loved
     it" was nigh. And, unsatisfied with even that level of rhetoric,
     Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) went so far as to compare August 1, 2012, to
     America's darkest hours:

     [Y]ou can think of the times America was attacked. One is December
     7, that's Pearl Harbor Day. The other is September 11, and that's
     the day the terrorists attacked. I want you to remember August 1,
     2012, the attack on our religious freedom. That is a day that will
     live in infamy, along with those other dates.
     What event occurred on August 1, 2012, to give rise to such
     fire-and-brimstone rhetoric? A terrorist attack? A dastardly sneak
     attack by an enemy nation? A tyrannical military coup d'état?
     Hardly. Instead, August 1, 2012, is the day that the 99 percent of
     American women who have used contraception (including 98 percent of
     Catholic women) could kiss their copays goodbye and save hundreds of
     dollars a year on essential reproductive health care. On that date,
     the contraceptive-coverage benefit of the Affordable Care Act (also
     known as "Obamacare") went into effect. Under the new policy, most
     employers' health-insurance plans (other than those for houses of
     worship) must begin covering FDA-approved contraception (including
     sterilization and emergency contraception) and associated counseling
     without cost-sharing--eliminating contraceptive copays.

 Defending a negative ([907]0+ / 0-)

   To the extent that there is any argument in the diary, it would be that
   Kelly's claim that the president divides us on the three issues of
   race, income, and by picking winners and losers can be entirely
   encapsulated by the phrase, "the president is a black guy." No effort
   whatsoever was made to defend this. Presumably, we are to recognize it
   as self-evident racism.
   My precise point was that this is itself 1) a conspiracy theory and 2)
   not self-evident.

   But it is neither up to me nor is it a reasonable challenge to have to
   prove that an unelaborated characterization is wrong, any more than it
   would be rational of me to ask you to show how something you said is
   not dumb. I would say, "Go ahead, prove it." And you would reasonably
   respond that it is up to me to first show what's dumb about your
   remark.

   I hope that passes for the reasoned explanation requested.

 Occam's Razor... ([923]0+ / 0-)

     Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate - "Plurality must
     never be posited without necessity."
                            --William of Ockham, ca. 1500

   Isaac Newton took a slightly different shot at it:

     We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are
     both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. Therefore, to
     the same natural effects we must, so far as possible, assign the
     same causes.

   So, what does that mean?  Well, my version is far simpler and requires
   no Latin grammar:

     Whenever possible, KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID!

   Given that Kelly made the argument, then simply engaged in
   proof-by-assertion when asked for evidence to support his argument,
   what is the simplest explanation that can be reasonably posited?

   By all means...educate us.

       Aside from anything else, Ockham's principle is a non-demonstrable

       would know either what would be necessary or possible. In addition,
       if you are going to follow Newton, you ought to confine yourself,
       as he says, to natural things and natural effects. The case in
       point has nothing to do with these.
       Beyond that, you confuse the simple and simplistic. The explanation
       Hunter offered was certainly simple. However, in referring
       everything to a unique cause, without any attempt to demonstrate
       that such  a thing was a cause, let alone a unique one, the simple
       passed to the simplistic, Kelly's assertion may also well lack
       foundation, but Hunter's response isn't any advance. It, and your
       defense, go literally nowhere, remaining at the 'he said/he said
       level.' And in any case, mere simplicity is not nearly enough to
       make a case. I could offer the simple explanation that Mr. Obama's
       actions are due to his failure to get adequate sleep. Strangely,
       the simplicity of that explanation does nothing to make it true.
       I presume you are now educated. My work is done.

   race," but absolutely agree that the idiocracy that has been the most
   visible/vocal portion of the current conservative constituency in
   recent years would not be possible without all the racial dog whistles
   and similar verbal/social mechanisms they use.

   I think it was a thing before Obama was even on the scene, as we had
   similar nuttiness reacting to Clinton in the '90s, (he's gonna take
   your guns, he's gonna take your money and give it to black people--err
   I mean "welfare queens"). Of course there are really conservatives who
   I believe really, truly disagree with our "side" on matters of policy,
   and for those able to articulate their concerns without frothing at the
   mouth with a bunch of black helicopter crap, it actually makes for
   pretty interesting conversation--I have several Republican/conservative
   friends who will talk to me because they actually are interested in my
   opinion, rather than simply wanting to patronize or insult me. In their
   case, we can talk politics, and it will be about what's actually going
   on rather than a bunch of finger-pointing and name-calling. It's more
   like intellectual sparring and I rather enjoy the stimulation.

   Anyhow, good diary, tipped and rec'd :)

   more than anything it's those racist blowhards standing on  every

   good results--but always bad outcomes.  The clergy seems to often be an
   offender instead of a force for good.  What's left--biracial marriages.
    When the family is a rainbow, bigotry will recede.  As more gays came
   out of the closet, their families had to reconcile love with bigotry.

   Let's use a Republican tool in this effort--tax breaks.  Marry outside
   your race, pay 10% less tax.  Stay married for 5 years, this rises to
   15%.  Money doesn't buy love, but a little push from the IRS can't
   hurt.  Hey--we've tried everything else--why not go this route?

   Mike Kelly is universally recognized to be a total hypocrite, even
   among Republicans (at least among the ones I've talked to in his CD).
   He was elected on the tea-party wave of 2010, ousting Democrat Kathy
   Dahlkemper after her first and only term.  However, in a very
   un-tea-party-like fashion, he has sought to bring home the bacon to his
   own district.  Oh, sure, he'll vote against food stamps and vote to
   overturn Obamacare, and Roe v. Wade and passes all those other
   ultra-conservative litmus tests, but fiscally, he is only for reducing
   the size of government if such a cut does not affect his district.

   But, again, I suspect this sort of hypocrisy if rife among the
   tea-bagger class.

   As my grandmother used to say, "if you don't have something nice to say
   then don't say anything at all." And she went through a lot of bars of
   soap cleaning up kids that badmouthed others. When someone is only
   interested in attacking, tearing down, insulting, insinuating, tossing
   out rumors and total lies then they are the ones I don't listen to.
   Mostly because they are not saying anything but negative. If someone
   has a good idea, I like to hear it, fact check it, break it down,
   analyze it and get others opinions on it.

   I think many people are like this. But since these bullies on steroids
   have the loudest megaphone on the planet they get their misinformation
   out there over those that are spreading the facts. It's high time we
   forced journalists into a corner and had them do more investigation
   before they spread someone's lies. Or allowed them to continue to
   blather on without offering a shred of proof. But grandmothers had the

   notoriously reasonable and conciliatory. It's not in his DNA.

   That's why I couldn't be in politics. I'd morph pretty quickly into a
   Sopranos-style, back-East, Neapolitan thug and let them have it.  All
   in all, and over time, Obama's cooler style seems to fit right for the
   time for me. I think in the long run people will recognize his kind of
   dignity.

   This country is in a tortured condition, and if Obama were more
   confrontational, things would be even worse.

       Obama speaks frankly and truthfully, and they feel indicted by what

   you did it in very simple terms which is not easy to do. It just seems
   that way because it's that well done. Thank you!

   You are so right and I never saw it just that way. It is the one
   unifying factor. I knew it was a big one but didn't realize it was THE
   one.

   This is a sickening message but we need to pay great attention to it in
   order to realize the prevalence of racism that has been mostly hidden
   under the rug for decades and decades. We can only work on it when we
   see it for the huge mega problem it is. I must confess that even though
   I realized all along that there was a lot of  racism, I had no idea it
   was still so ingrained, so negative, so merciless in so many of us. And
   it makes me hate that our society has enabled and allowed this to
   fester ever since the Civil War with terrible consequences not just for
    African Americans but for the whole country, for in the end it will
   either  be solved and bring us up or will bring us down. I don't see
   how having acknowledged it we can ever go back to status quo racism and
   we certainly don't want to.

   It is odd to me that the defining issue that made me become a political
   person, the Civil Rights Movement I grew up in, during the 50's and
   60's, has once again become a preeminent issue.

 Would a white O'bama have been elected president? ([1282]0+ / 0-)

   I think not, he would have been just one more politician with a "from
   rags to riches story" and not as compelling as many others.   Many
   people wanted to be part of electing the first Black President,
   including me.   It just seemed right but was Barrack the first Black
   president?    I think not,

   Lincoln could have been Black and indeed when I first saw old pictures
   of Abe, I thought he was Black and I still do.
   Can I  explain it?  I have first hand experience with many people who
   passed for white simply because that is what they appearred to be, no
   one even thought to ask such a ridiculous question.

   I worked in a field where family DNA was important to trace family
   diseases passed on to offspring.   My eyes were opened to the false
   assumptions accepted as fact about race.

   Who is that Black man sitting with John?   That is his father, I was
   told.   I asked if they meant his step-father and they replied, no that
   is his birth father.   There were
   similar features if you looked closely but their color was
   as different as night and day.   Perhaps Race is in the eye of the
   beholder more than in fact.
