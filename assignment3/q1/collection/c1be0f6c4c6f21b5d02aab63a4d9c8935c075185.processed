[24]Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: War, Death, and Words

   Most of the punditry regulars were off on tangents this morning... so I
   decided to do the same. Here are some fascinating bits from the
   editorial pages attached to names that for the most part are not Sunday
   morning staples.

   [30]Tom Diaz looks at how fear of terrorism, which is very rare, trumps
   fear of all too common gun violence.

     The next time you play airport security theater -- remove shoes,
     display laptop, toss water bottle -- think of the children at Sandy
     Hook Elementary School. Think of the moviegoers in Aurora, Colo.,
     the citizens in Tucson peaceably assembled to meet with Rep.
     Gabrielle Giffords, the worshippers at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek,
     Wis., and Hadiya Pendleton, the 15-year-old Chicago girl killed by
     gunfire days after coming to Washington with her high school band
     for President Obama's second inauguration. ...

     Then ponder this: Americans suffer assaults on their privacy -- they
     are groped in public and wiretapped en masse -- and surrender their
     constitutional protections against unwarranted searches in the name
     of the war on terror, yet they cannot muster the will to protect
     children from mass murder with military-style weapons. We have spent
     more than $1 trillion on homeland security since Sept. 11, 2001, yet
     have withheld annual funding of less than $3 million for research by
     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on gun violence.

   Since this is Sunday morning, I'll just say... Amen. This is your Read
   the Whole Thing read of the morning.

   [31]Lincoln Caplan reminds us that it's ridiculous to gut the Voting
   Rights Act in the while so many of those involved in its birth are
   still with us.

     March 7, 1965, became known as Bloody Sunday in the annals of the
     civil rights struggle in America. That day, around 500 people set
     out to march the 54 miles from Selma, Ala., to the state capital in
     Montgomery in support of what would become the Voting Rights Act.
     ...

     A state trooper told them they were "an unlawful assembly" and
     ordered them to disperse. When they did not, they were attacked by
     about 150 troopers and others who wielded billy clubs and tear gas.
     Fifty-eight people were treated for injuries at a local hospital,
     including Representative John Lewis, then 25 and chairman of the
     Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, for a skull fracture.

   [32]Kate Murphy visits with Americans who have have taken to trails and
   highways to walk across the nation.

     Rather than walking to demonstrate religious commitment, many
     dedicate their cross-country walks to a cause recalling Peace
     Pilgrim (a k a Mildred Norman Ryder), who walked more than 25,000
     miles across America from 1953 to 1981 for world peace. Mr. Stalls,
     for example, walked to benefit the microlending organization Kiva,
     while Mr. Ilgunas walked the length of the proposed Keystone XL
     pipeline to draw attention to its impact on the environment. ...

     Walks across America tend to end with a baptismal dip in the ocean.
     "You have no idea the feeling I had putting my feet in the Atlantic
     waters," said Richard Noble, who quit his job as a film festival
     cashier last year to walk 2,700 miles from San Francisco to
     Jacksonville Beach, Fla., for gay rights. His trip was fully
     financed by strangers who gave him money, food and shelter en route,
     as well as donated online through his blog. "You can't experience
     that kind of generosity and be the same person you were before," he
     said.

   What cause could get you up and moving for the better part of a year?
   Think about that, then come inside to continue your journey along the
   backroads of punditry.

   [33]Paul Finkleman provides a mini-bio of the little remembered man who
   thought through some of the rules that, unfortunately, are still so
   important to us a hundred and fifty years later.

     The philosopher and legal scholar Francis Lieber was born in 1798 in
     Germany, and as a young man was wounded in the final skirmishes of
     the Napoleonic wars. He emigrated to the United States in 1827,
     after twice being imprisoned by Prussian authorities for his
     pro-reform political activities. ...

     From the start of the war, Lieber was obsessed with the legal
     parameters of its prosecution. On Aug. 19, 1861, he published an
     open letter in The New York Times to consider the nature of
     Confederate prisoners. The issue concerned the treatment of captured
     Confederates -- whether they were soldiers or pirates -- and also
     how captured Union soldiers might be treated. He noted that this was
     an issue that called for "considerations of law, authority,
     humanity, [and] wise foresight." In arguing that traditional rules
     of war should be applied to prisoners, he asserted that this was not
     a formal or diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy but was merely
     "the recognition of reality."

   Leiber's writing on guerrilla forces was in many ways more humane than
   our current attitude, and were written in the midst of a bloody war
   that took the life of his own son. Your historical read of the morning.

   [34]Paul Krugman puts together a couple of articles to show you what
   you already knew: conservative punditry is up for sale to the highest
   bidder. Want RedState founder Josh Trevino and the Heritage Foundation
   to support an anti-freedom, anti-Israel, anti-capitalism government and
   attack the candidate trying to bring democracy? Sure thing, just pony
   up the cash.

   [35]Geofferey O'Brien wants you to look down at the bottom of your
   comment and consider the impact of that little quote you've been
   carrying around.

     What is the use of quotations? They have of, course, their practical
     applications for after-dinner speakers or for editorialists looking
     to buttress their arguments. They also make marvelous filler for
     otherwise uninspired conversations. But the gathering of such
     fragments responds to a much deeper compulsion. It resonates with
     the timeless desire to seize on the minimal remnant -- the tiniest
     identifiable gesture -- out of which the world could, in a pinch, be
     reconstructed. Libraries may go under, cultures may go under, but
     single memorizable bits of rhyme and discourse persist over
     centuries.

   A nifty little article, itself containing more than one good quote.
   Your literary obsession read of the morning.

   [36]The New York Times views the change of Obama for America into
   Organizing for America as a dangerous escalation in the Washington
   money war.

     In Fact, there are no limits, because the group has reorganized as a
     501(c)(4), a so-called social welfare group unbound by campaign
     restrictions. Corporations and billionaires can write checks of any
     size, aware that they are giving to a group with close ties to the
     White House, one that is busily promoting President Obama's agenda.
     And now that this White House has torn down the last wall between
     its needs and those of special interests, others in the future will
     undoubtedly do the same. ...

     Any corporation with a matter pending before the administration can
     give lavishly to Organizing for Action as a way of currying favor,
     knowing that the West Wing will take note. (The group does not have
     to disclose its donors but says it will, and also plans to reject
     money from registered lobbyists and PACs.) It is also a way for
     donors to bypass the limits on giving to the Democratic Party: the
     new group does similar work, but without the restrictions on
     donations.

   [37]Ross Douthat praises "the Ratzinger Legacy," because, sure the
   church's reputation and popularity have suffered, but at least they
   didn't let women into the clubhouse or hold their own responsible for
   crimes. You knew there had to be someone.

   [38]Kathleen Parker shows that yes, it is possible to overreact (and
   overact) even more than Bob Woodward. What does it mean that one of
   Woodward's best friends in government had the temerity to (amid a nest
   of apologies) tell him he was wrong? What does it mean that the press
   wasn't allowed to stand around the tee with the president and Tiger?
   Why, it's the coming of state controlled media! Your unintentionally
   comedic read of the morning.

   [39]Leonard Pitts reinforces just how much the Voting Rights Act is not
   out of date.

     Watching media empires built upon appeals to racial resentment,
     seeing the injustice system wield mass incarceration as a weapon
     against black men, bearing witness as the first African-American
     president produced his long form birth certificate, all helped me
     understand just how silly we were to believe bigotry was done.

     So a chill crawled my spine last week as the Supreme Court heard
     arguments in a case that could result in gutting the Voting Rights
     Act. That landmark 1965 legislation gave the ballot to black voters
     who had previously been denied it by discriminatory laws, economic
     threats, violence and by registrars who challenged them with
     nonsense questions like, "How many bubbles are in a bar of soap."

   [40]Margaret Roach puts some extra thought into a purchase that many of
   us look forward to each year.

     What could be a greener, more feel-good purchase than seeds? Aren't
     the tiny plant embryos, huddled in the suspended animation of
     dormancy inside a simple paper packet, true innocence incarnate? ...

     Lately, I've needed a new ethical code to guide my seed shopping. I
     want seed that was raised in conditions like my own -- in a
     low-input system -- and if possible, in a geographically similar
     environment. That way, I'm contributing less to the pollution caused
     by conventional seed growing, and I am likely to have better growing
     success.

   If, like me, you are currently juggling the names of a half dozen
   carrots and five kinds of potatoes, wondering which variety rates a
   head start in the greenhouse and which deserve space in the raised
   beds, give this a read first. Your backyard science read of the
   morning.

   [41]Evgeney Morozov ponders whether it's possible to out engineer the
   grim reaper.

     ...the dominant ideology of Silicon Valley today: what could be
     disrupted should be disrupted -- even death.

     Barriers and constraints -- anything that imposes artificial limits
     on the human condition -- are being destroyed with particular gusto.
     ...

     All these efforts to ease the torments of existence might sound like
     paradise to Silicon Valley. But for the rest of us, they will be
     hell. They are driven by a pervasive and dangerous ideology that I
     call "solutionism": an intellectual pathology that recognizes
     problems as problems based on just one criterion: whether they are
     "solvable" with a nice and clean technological solution at our
     disposal. Thus, forgetting and inconsistency become "problems"
     simply because we have the tools to get rid of them -- and not
     because we've weighed all the philosophical pros and cons.

   As someone who has long sought immortality via the Woody Allen method
   (i.e. by not dying), it's hard not to cheer on the engineers. If only
   so many of them weren't engaged in just painting over the tombstones.

   My own little photographic addition to the morning, taken just outside
   my back door.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       My Birthday was two weeks later.

     March 7, 1965,  Civil Rights Activists march the 54 miles from
     Selma, Ala., to the state capital in Montgomery
       All those who protested for Civil Rights in the South were such
       brave people. They got their heads busted right and left and much
       worse too.

       In the fell clutch of circumstance

   The time I first found it disturbing was in 2008 when the Obama
   campaign told supporters/liberals/progressives to give contributions
   only to the campaign and not to independent groups... and they did.

   Democracy begins at home. 50-state strategy for the party, and public
   financing for campaigns. Lots of other reforms would help too: shorter
   election cycle, proportional representation, ranked-choice voting...
   Unfortunately all of them chicken-and-egg with peeling the corporate
   cash grip off of politics and press.

   Government and laws are the agreement we all make to secure everyone's

       OFA can push a Democratic agenda and that's bad?

       My only hope in the business world was self-employment, in
       relationships with men (of my generation) was living alone, in this
       culture was fighting back hard.
       I hope OFA sucks up corporate contributions and uses them against
       the NRA, the MIC, the GOP, and all the other groups that have paid
       for their personal politicians.
       I suspect the Obama team will gladly support Democrats who aren't

     yes, the church still believes in the Resurrection, the Trinity and
     the Virgin birth.

     the church believes that its doctrines are compatible with reason,

       Ratzinger ensured that the Catholic church shored its conservative
       base by refusing any reforms.
       The church leadership went all strong father on its flock, focusing
       on repression -- of sexual reality, of children raped by priests,
       of women's rights.  And Douthat's somehow celebrating that
       Ratzinger kept the church sound and coherent, while public opinion
       polls show American catholics diametrically opposed to their
       bishops on every contentious issue.  So it's basically, I disagree
       with Dad about everything, but I know Mom would be hurt if I didn't
       come home for the holidays.
       Meanwhile, the Episcopal church (in the US) took the opposite tack,
       with most conservatives now gone -- either for American Anglican
       churches or to the Catholic church.  In the parish where my wife is
       rector, there are gay couples -- some married, some in long-time
       relationships -- including a leader of one of the youth groups and
       a church administrator.  The priest is (duh) a woman.  The ministry
       is focused on social justice and welcoming everyone.  And --
       surprise! -- the congregation includes an awful lot of cradle
       Catholics.

       A double lie. One, because while overall life expectancies have
       improved since the 30's, life expectancies for people who live till
       adulthood, when they start working and contributing to SS, have
       only gone up modestly. Before that most people don't work and thus
       don't contribute to SS, or draw upon it, directly or through
       someone who does, so they don't count.
       And two, the extra years that people who do survive into adulthood
       are living can easily be covered by lifting the payroll tax cap.
       These people lie for a living. That's literally all they do. George
       Will is paid to lie in print and on TV. That's his job. He is paid
       to sell lies. That ABC chooses to put him on This Week says as much

   So what's the premise behind the NYT argument against the escalation of
   money in politics through the morphing of OFA.  Its seems to be that
   the progressive left can't escalate money in politics through
   organizations like OFA and still be for getting money out of politics.
    So what would they like us to do, not spend money on our candidates
   and causes out of some blind adherence to principle, while the other
   side ravages the political system with out of control spending on their
   candidates and causes?

   That's both naive and insane.  While the system exists, we must play in
   it or we will lose.  That doesn't mean we have to abandon are fight for
   things like a Constitutional Amendment to clarify that corporations are
   not people in order to be seen as not compromising our principles.  In
   fact, ironically, if we ever hope to win Constitutional changes such as
   this, we are going to have to pour money into the political system to
   elect representatives who will support these changes.

   NYT should get off its high horse and look at the reality of the
   current situation.

   Of course, I agree with the gist of Tom Diaz's article, namely that
   there should be more gun control and that we should spend more money on
   research into gun violence and less on anti-terrorism.  That said,
   there's an either/or argument being made here that, like most either/or
   arguments, bothers me.  I don't see any reason why people can't be
   concerned (and government money can't be spent) on both terrorism from
   external enemies and the very-serious problem of domestic gun violence.
    In fact, as the Brady Campaign has been arguing for many years, the
   two issues go hand-in-hand; weak U.S. gun laws help make it easier for
   al-Qaeda and their associates to get weapons, which they can then use
   for terrorism.

   Also, it bothers me how often I see liberals dismiss concerns about
   terrorism by arguing that it takes fewer lives than other threats, or
   is "very rare" (to use the words the diary uses).  Government is
   rightly concerned about both dangers that take many lives, and others
   that take fewer lives; relatively few people die from drowning or
   defective consumer products, yet we (rightly) have swimming advisory
   warnings and a Consumer Product Safety Commission.  Moreover, terrorism
   does damage to a society far beyond the number of lives immediately
   affected by it, and there is broad agreement all over the political
   spectrum that protecting the U.S. from outside threats is a prime
   responsibility of the federal government.

   "We" didn't decide on the funding of either of those programs.
   Congressional funding is based entirely on what they decide will hurt
   or harm the people funding them and electing them, not the common good.
   So of course Republicans are going to block and defund anything having
   to do with gun violence. The Homeland Security funding was easy,
   because prior to 9/11, you couldn't carry guns on airplanes anyway, and
   there was no historic struggle for "second amendment rights" on planes.

   And then there is no rebuttal.  No mention of the fact that the
