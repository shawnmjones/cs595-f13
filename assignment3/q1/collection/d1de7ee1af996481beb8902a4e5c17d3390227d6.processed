O'Reilly throws his support behind immigration bill

   It looks like the lobbying [3]paid off.

     Senators gained on Thursday what they clearly see as a crucial new
     ally in their quest to pass an immigration measure: Bill O'Reilly.

     The Fox News host announced that, after the completion of a new
     Senate deal on border security, he was in favor of the bill's
     passage.

     "It is time for the USA to pass immigration reform," he said. "For
     years I've called for a more secure southern border, you know that.
     And now it looks like the secure border is in reach. At least
     somewhat. So I hope this bill does become law."

   The announcement comes on the heels of a New Yorker [4]piece noting
   that Republican members of the Senate's Gang of Eight [5]privately
   lobbied O'Reilly and other Fox News hosts, hoping their endorsement of
   the reform bill would improve its prospects.

   Indeed, note that after O'Reilly threw his support to the Senate bill
   last night, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) issued [6]a press release to
   trumpet the endorsement.

   On a certain level, I'm hard pressed to imagine why it matters whether
   a conservative media personality endorses pending legislation or not,
   but if Fox's hosts are seen by the public as [7]leading members of the
   Republican Party, it stands to reason that they'll not only be lobbied
   by senators, but that their pronouncements will carry some weight
   within the GOP.

   Someone must have taken Orally to a Mexican Restaurant, and he was
   surprised that no Messikenz were screaming at their waiters,
   "Madre-Fer, I want more Tequila Sunrise! And how about some more salsa
   and chips!!!!"

   Oh well, I'll take some progress no matter how we get it.

   Well...O'reilly is one of the leaders of the Republican party after
   all...

   Just like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh...just ask people

   I wonder if they have told Boehner it's ok for him to have a vote on
   this yet...

   isn't it wonderful that the gop is being run by tv and radio
   personalities. i would be so proud to say that the people i look up to
   and base my opinions and votes on are a bunch of overpaid talking
   heads. for all the geniuses on the right, limbaugh has been married 4
   times, has admitted to numerous affairs while married, and has been to
   drug rehab at least twice. now there is a model of honesty, virtue, and
   common sense. not!

   It won't matter. The Teapers in the House have already declared this
   dead on arrival.

   At some point, wouldn't you think that these endorsements indicate it's
   a bad bill?

   Now if they can just get Rush to go along it's in the bag!

   The NOP is a wreck.

   I wonder if Hillary is courting Rachel's endorsement? LOL! I know Scott
   Brown was afraid of her but come on...

   What a bizarre reality the NOP is created to live in.

   Nothing like a spoonful of $40 billion dollars in new drone and
   security hardware contracts to make the immigration medicine go down.

   george, you know it depends who is getting the extra spending. if some
   of that money is going to find its way back to the gop coffers than
   they might vote for it. if not then it is surely a dead issue.

   For crying out loud you ignorant liberals! If O'Rielly comes out for it
   you are supposed to decide to be against it. It works so well on their
   side after all. I mean take any bill written by the republicans in the
   past and have Obama try and get it put into effect , see how the right
   reverses their stance.
