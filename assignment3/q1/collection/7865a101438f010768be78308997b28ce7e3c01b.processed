     * These are some very, very [32]bright pink eight-inch slugs.
     * Do you live in an [33]Emma state or a Sophia state?
     * [34]Oklahoma state Rep. Doug Cox:

     All of the new Oklahoma laws aimed at limiting abortion and
     contraception are great for the Republican family that lives in a
     gingerbread house with a two-car garage, two planned kids and a dog.
     In the real world, they are less than perfect.

     As a practicing physician (who never has or will perform an
     abortion), I deal with the real world. In the real world, 15- and
     16-year-olds get pregnant (sadly, 12-, 13- and 14-year-olds do
     also). In the real world, 62 percent of women ages 20 to 24 who give
     birth are unmarried. And in the world I work and live in, an
     unplanned pregnancy can throw up a real roadblock on a woman's path
     to escaping the shackles of poverty.
     Yet I cannot convince my Republican colleagues that one of the best
     ways to eliminate abortions is to ensure access to contraception.
     * I think even most copy editors would agree that this is [35]going a
       little overboard as a response to a typo.
     * [36]Not quite Jurassic Park, but:

     A perfectly preserved woolly mammoth carcass with liquid blood has
     been found on a remote Arctic island, fueling hopes of cloning the
     Ice Age animal, Russian scientists said Thursday.
     * Apparently the Catholic Church has a [37]top exorcist who says he's
       dealt with 160,000 demons.
     * Union organizer and cancer survivor Jane McAlevey on [38]breast
       cancer, Angelina Jolie, and the health care industry.
     * [39]Amanda Marcotte flays Erick Erickson:

     I know it's hard to do when 99% of your rather shrunken mental space
     is taken up with trying to convince yourself that you're
     smarter/tougher/less laughable than you are, but you can't just
     declare something "science" and call it a day. At bare minimum,
     "science" requires things like "evidence". Even coughing up one
     example of other animals who play house would have been useful.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [52]Tagging tips - [53]Search For Tags - [54]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       preserved mammoths found in Russia over the years.  One find is
       reported in Solzhenitzyn's "Gulag Archipelago"--the soviet-era
       prisoners come upon a mammoth carcass in the ice, with very well
       preserved meat.  Because they are starving, they don't give much
       thought to the science involved; they just eat the meat...

     The Catholic Church's top exorcist, who claims to have sent 160,000
     demons back to hell, says he wants Pope Francis to allow all priests
     to start performing the ritual to deal with a rising demand for
     exorcisms from the faithful.

     Father Gabriele Amorth, 88, who also heads the International
     Association of Exorcists

   1st - Thanks Padre Gabe for vanquishing to hell all of those pesky
   demon thingies.

   2nd - Those were unauthorized exorcisms that you just did as a side
   job?

   3nd - How do I get membership in the International Association of
   Exorcists? I really need to be a member, it would look good on my

       These same folks believe that sex is a sin unless it's for the
       explicit purpose of making babies, so every sex act has to have
       that possibility as a sword hanging over the head. That's often
       their biggest problem with gay sex -- you get the fun without the
       worry of pregnancy.

       choosing (if you'll pardon the term) not to perform abortions. I
       know that Bill Clinton's phrasing of abortions being "safe, legal
       and rare" gets slammed in some circles, but when it comes down to
       it it's often safer (and cheaper) to prevent the pregnancy in the
       first place than it is to terminate it. And certainly cheaper to
       prevent the pregnancy than to support an unwanted child for years.

       Since he seems to think that you can have a family of 2 planned

       No contraceptives means a return to families of ten or twelve
       children.  More poverty.  A necessity for more and bigger schools
       and more teachers.  Higher property taxes! Banning abortion and
       contraception leads to higher taxes.

   Oklahoma Representative Doug Cox.  It is nice to hear a statement made
   by a physician who has been elected in a Red State, and who expresses
   to sheer common sense that nobody wants an abortion.  It is simply a
   fact of life, that sometimes in life, the personal decisions that
   people have to make for themselves for their own lives should not be
   subject to publicity.

   That is the essence of freedom!

   160.000 demons.

   Let's say he's been at it for 40 years.
   And he's a hard worker. A dedicated exorcist.
   Never rests, he's been putting in seven day weeks for forty years. No
   holidays, not a single day off.

   Still had to do ten demons/day.

   I didn't see any stories saying "Dad nominated to head FBI" or "U.S.

 I live in the Olivia state. ([330]0+ / 0-)

   But I don't know of many Olivias. Brooklyn is a more popular name here,
   I think, along with a lot of very weirdly spelled more common girl's
   names.

   Around here, parents take pride in giving their babies names that look
   like the parents never learned basic spelling.
   A few years ago, one fellow I know told me he had a new baby daughter.
   When I asked what the baby's name was, he said "Ocean".
   I thought that was an unusual and quite nice girl's name. Then he told
   me he and his wife made the name extra-special by spelling it "Oshun".

   Nothing better than too much of a good thing, I guess.

   Right many are called, and damn few are chosen.

       I'm pretty sure his wife came up with the spelling- the ladies are

       even less sophisticated than he is.

 Roman Catholic Top Exorcist is a Liar ([348]0+ / 0-)

     Apparently the Catholic Church has a top exorcist who says he's
     dealt with 160,000 demons.

   Last week, this fraud [349]told the Catholic press that the new pope
   had exorcised a demon from a man the pope touched in public. The
   Vatican press office would only say that "the pope didn't intend to
   perform an exorcism".

   Maybe if these possessed people talked to psychiatrists they'd get
   "exorcisms" without relying on the pope's busy schedule.
