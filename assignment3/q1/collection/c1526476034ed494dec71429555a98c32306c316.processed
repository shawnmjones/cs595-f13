Job totals disappoint again, but overall rate inches lower

   We were getting spoiled. After a terrific three-month stretch from
   December through February, it was tempting to think U.S. job creation
   was finally on track. But as we've [3]seen before, the first few months
   of the year aren't always an indication of where things are headed.

   The U.S. economy added [4]115,000 jobs in April, which fell short of
   already-tepid expectations, while the overall unemployment rate dipped
   slightly to 8.1%. As has been the case, there was a big gap in the
   public vs. private sectors -- American businesses added 130,000 jobs
   last month, while the government shed 15,000 jobs.

   It is the second consecutive month of disappointing totals, but there
   was a silver lining in today's Bureau of Labor Statistics report -- job
   creation in February and March were both revised up by a combined
   53,000 jobs. It offers a reminder that these initial estimates are just
   that -- initial estimates -- and that overreacting to new reports
   generally isn't a good idea.

   That doesn't change the fact, however, that 115,000 obviously isn't
   good enough. It's a figure that barely keeps up with population growth,
   and is roughly half of what the economy should be producing as part of
   a larger recovery. Ideally, policymakers would see data like this and
   take steps to boost job creation, but given the Republican agenda in
   Congress, that's no longer an option.

   The overall economy has now added over 2 million jobs over the last
   year, and nearly 3.5 million jobs over the last three years. For
   America's private sector, it's 2.3 million over the last year, and 4
   million over the last three years.

   Incidentally, the 8.1% unemployment rate is the lowest since before
   President Obama took office, but as we've talked about before, that's
   not necessarily the best metric for looking at the overall jobs
   landscape, and in April, it was largely the result of people dropping
   out of the workforce.

   And with that, here's the chart I run on the first Friday of every
   month, showing monthly job losses since the start of the Great
   Recession. The image makes a distinction -- red columns point to
   monthly job totals under the Bush administration, while blue columns
   point to job totals under the Obama administration. (By popular demand,
   it now has an x axis.)

   Update: Here's another chart, this one showing monthly job losses/gains
   in just the private sector since the start of the Great Recession.

   It is in positive territory. Private sector growth is improving at a
   decent rate considering. The States are running out of police officers
   and teachers to lay off.

   A lot of our current problems are tied directly to the European
   austerity disaster. It is hard to make money when a giant world market
   is full free fall in a self inflicted double dip recession.

   On another important front, gas prices have dropped significantly in
   the last couple of weeks. Of course, we don't see that reported in the
   mainstream media.

   This is in "positive territory" like the engine temperature gauge moves
   in a positive direction AFTER your car breaks down from overheating.

   There is nothing positive about today's unemployment and jobs numbers
   unless you say "it could be worse."

   You can argue over whose fault it is, who should be president, what can
   turn it around, but you can not argue with a straight face that the
   1/10th of a drop in unemployment is positive or good news.

   The unemployment rate is not what it purports to be. We are losing
   ground, not gaining ground. Job creation is not keeping pace with
   population growth, those entering the job market for the first time.
   The decrease in the rate is due solely to people who quit looking for
   jobs.

   It is difficult to grasp unless you look at the numbers, but the
   unemployment rate can do DOWN and the job market, job outlook, economy
   can be getting worse and lose ground. Why even NBC is [19]reporting
   that 4/5 of all the decrease in the unemployment rate is due to those
   dropping out of the job search market.

   Real bad numbers big time and likely the source of Romney's better
   showing in swing state polls. Obama has to pivot his campaign, at some
   not to distant point, to a Trumanesque run against a "do worse than
   nothing" Congress and Hooverish Romney, who created loads of jobs in
   China. Dems should focus on running as a brand. How many think that
   will ever happen?

   They aren't real bad numbers big time. The numbers are disappointing,
   but they are moving in the right direction. Remember the Republicans in
   the Red States are running out of teachers to lay off.

   Actually state revenues are improving some so there will be pressure on
   State legislatures and governors to hire in a few months.

   What is your proof that Romney is doing better in swing states? I need
   to see a series of polls over time. I do know that Robert's Supreme
   Court Citizens United ads are running wall to wall here in Missouri.
   That might have something to do with current polls.

   State and local layoffs will accelerate as their tax receipts have not
   recovered to pre 2008 levels while demand for spending has increased.
   Furloughs, layoffs, and reductions are not limited to teachers.
   Bloomberg is trying to close 20 firehouses in NYC. Consumer demand (70%
   of the economy) for durable goods is down and unlikely to rebound any
   time soon.

   Romney's numbers have improved in Oh & Fl.

   I guess that is what Republicans are hoping, but they face a real
   problem when they continue to cut state services. People blame the
   politicians doing the cutting.

   My grandmother, who was raised on a farm, used to say that the
   definition of "potential" was the number of apple trees contained in a
   single apple. With that in mind, I ask you to chew on this sobering
   statistic: the number of working age Americans that do not have jobs is
   approaching 100 million. That's a lot of lost potential! That single
   "apple" contains in it the seeds of orchards full of America's future
   growth.

   There are, of course, the 12.6 million Americans who are officially
   recognized as "unemployed." Those are the ones talked about in
   headlines. But, there are another 87.8 million Americans "of working
   age" who do not have jobs and are no longer counted in the Labor
   Dept.'s "unemployment numbers." Those folks are the ones who have
   supposedly "become discouraged and have stopped looking for work." As
   if there were any truth to that fantasy. I doubt a single one of them
   wouldn't rather have a job. This is the classic case of confusing the
   cause with the victim in a situation. People may be discouraged, but
   it's much more likely that they're discouraged with the fact that
   there's a job market, but it doesn't have room in it for them!

   The American economy is moving in the right direction. Contrary to the
   lies and exaggerations of an out-of-touch Mitt Romney, Obama has not
   made the jobs picture "worse." Millions of new jobs have been added
   over the last three years and the needle continues to point forward.
   But America will never be able to fully recover until conservative
   lawmakers and Republican politicians stop their strategy of jobs
   sabotage and get on the page of helping this country, not just their
   own political aspirations. [42]http://www.sunstateactivist.org

   Hard to tell from the limited y axis data, but I assume the prior month
   revisions are added into the chart going forward?

   It would be interesting to overlay the original reported numbers over
   the revised numbers to get a graphical sense of what the revisions have
   looked like during the last couple years.

   (TRENTON) - Assembly Budget Committee Chair Vincent Prieto
   (D-Hudson/Bergen) on Wednesday questioned the Christie administration's
   decision to halt yet another job-training program (Professional
   Services Group) for beleaguered, out-of-work New Jerseyans, while doing
   little to address the state's job creation needs.

   During today's Budget Committee hearing, Prieto questioned Department
   of Labor officials over the decision to shutter the statewide
   Professional Services Group program with little notice, a move that
   could potentially impact thousands of unemployed residents who utilize
   this network.

   "The Governor's blind eye on job creation and support for the
   unemployed continues to get more disturbing. After essentially
   declaring 'mission accomplished' with the 'Jersey Comeback,' now he's
   adding insult to injury for the roughly 400,000 unemployed residents
   still struggling to get back into the job market.

   "Yesterday the administration admitted to unilaterally dismantling a
   program to help train women and minorities in the building trades.
   Today we got confirmation that a comprehensive training program for
   out-of-work professionals is being halted with little notice.

   "We can't just sweep these pressing problems under the rug. If this
   program is in fact going to be revamped, we need answers as to how and
   what will struggling residents do in the interim while the program is
   being reworked?" said Prieto."

   Do we know how many jobs overall the Government has shed since 2009? I
   sense that the unemployment rate would be a bit lower if we would stop
   laying off government workers.

   Let's not buy into all the hype promoted by the right wingers. We've
   all heard the claim that these numbers aren't 'good enough', because
   this 'proves' that people are giving up on their job search out of
   frustration, but they completely ignore what really happened.

   After the economic collapse under Bush, millions of people didn't
   retire when they normally would have, because their retirement funds
   evaporated in front of their very eyes. This prevented normal job
   turnover and required new jobs to be created to employ young adults
   trying to enter the work force. Now that the stock market has rebounded
   (~65% since Obama was inaugurated), many of those people that delayed
   retirement now feel financially secure enough to retire allowing
   employers to employ younger people without creating 'new' jobs.

   In addition, after the collapse, many single-income families were faced
   with situations where both adults sought employment in the hopes that
   at least one of them could bring home enough to pay the bills. In these
   cases, we had one person losing a job and two searching for work.
   (Although the second usually wouldn't be counted in the unemployment
   numbers...depends on which statistics are being used.) When one of
   these adults found work, very often the second one stopped looking.
   That's not out of frustration. That's because their lives returned to
   normal!

   The big myth that the right is trying so hard to beat into their
   followers' brains is that people leaving the employment lines is a bad
   thing. It's all smoke and mirrors. These number are still a very good
   thing...especially when compared to the numbers of the Bush disaster.

   This number is going to worsen as technology continues to evolve. We
   really do have to rethink employment. What I said the other day is
   correct, we need 100,000,000 Ann Romneys staying home with the kids (or
   maybe some Andy Romneys). That means we are going to have to increase
   the wages of those remaining in the work place. The problem is
   structural and none of the politicians are even aware it exists.

   Here's the headline we should also be seeing - which is basically a
   quote from an analyst at Bloomberg tv, who put the brakes on the
   practial jig Betty Liu was doing over the idea the economy might truly
   be slowing (Betty Liu has been asking every single day for the last two
   years or so, in one form or the other - "But if the economy doesn't
   pick up, doesn't that hurt Obama's re-election chances?!") -- in any
   case, here's an alternative headline that's just as true:

   Obama Recovery Regains 5 Million Jobs Lost During Recession - In
   Addition, Adds a Net Positive of 150,000 Jobs

   If things were in reverse, and a Republican president had turned around
   a Democratic economic disaster, headlines like the above would no doubt
   only be the start of the positive reports we'd see, and the meme would
   instead be - "This president looks to be unbeatable in the general
   election!"
