   Daily Kos Radio's Kagro in the Morning show podcasts are now available
   through iTunes.

   [29]Rep. Don Young (R-AK) helps usher in the new Gop minority outreach!

   We'll finish up on the concept of "Trickle-down consumption," and
   continue to yell at WalMart, because we haven't reached the bottom of
   their evil just yet.

   There's so much other craziness out there, I just don't want to
   over-promise!

   It's Friday. We can wing it.

   We're LIVE at 9 a.m. ET with Kagro in the Morning, thanks to
   NetrootsRadio.com.

     Listen LIVE here:The Daily Kos Radio Player

     [EMBED]

     [30]Can't see the Flash player? Click here to download the stream
     directly.

   Or if you prefer, why not [31]download the Stitcher app on your
   favorite mobile device, and search for the Netroots Radio live stream?
   And hey, when you do, be sure to sign up with the promo code DAILYKOS,
   and earn Daily Kos Radio $1 in the Stitcher affiliate program!

   Please do remember to "favorite" us while you're at Stitcher. We're
   bouncing up and down in the rankings these days, and the more of you

   es/preload/no/no_addthis/no/

   Need more info on how to listen? Find it below the fold.

   We've been having some chronic problems with the phone-in system, and
   it's rightly pointed out that if we can't deliver on the promise, we
   shouldn't hold out the offer.

   I'll see what we can do to get the tech straightened out so that we can
   open the doors again, soon!

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [54]Tagging tips - [55]Search For Tags - [56]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   ____________________________________________________________

   Are you sure you want to remove this diary from your hotlist?
   Are you sure you want to remove your recommendation? You can only

     I don't want to play down the significance of universal background
     checks. Even if they might not have had any impact on the Newtown
     slayings -- Lanza's mother bought the guns, and it's unclear whether
     she would have been red-flagged -- it is obvious that comprehensive
     checks would keep some guns out of the wrong hands and save lives.

     New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is pouring millions of dollars into
     ad campaigns pressuring Congress to stand up to the NRA. President
     Obama, in a White House appearance Thursday with mothers of gun
     victims, noted that "right now, 90 percent of Americans support
     background checks. . . . How often do 90 percent of Americans agree
     on anything?"

     "Shame on us if we've forgotten" the Newtown tragedy, Obama said.
     "Now is the time to turn that heartbreak into something real."

     Amen.

   Recommended by:

     Perhaps most troubling for NRA leadership is that a majority of
     respondents--61 percent--in a recent Gallup poll say that the NRA
     does not reflect gun owners' views on guns.15 Even in gun-owning
     households, 49 percent of respondents say that the NRA reflects
     their views "only sometimes/never," while 50 percent of respondents
     answer "always/most of the time." The NRA's distance from gun owners
     suggests the organization is out of touch with its own constituency.
     And voters agree. A February Public Policy Polling poll shows that
     39 percent of Americans said that the NRA's support would make them
     less likely to support a candidate for office, while only 26 percent
     said the NRA's support would make them more likely to support a
     candidate.16
