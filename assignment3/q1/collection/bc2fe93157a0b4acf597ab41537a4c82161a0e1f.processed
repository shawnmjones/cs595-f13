Rafael Nadal beats Novak Djokovic to win U.S. Open

   updated 3:41 AM EDT, Wed September 11, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Rafael Nadal wins second U.S. Open title, 13th grand slam
     * He won three of four sets, dropping only the second
     * He has made triumphant return from knee injury

   (CNN) -- Rafael Nadal is back.

   After battling a knee injury which threatened to derail his glittering
   career, the Spaniard is back on track and back on top following a 6-2
   3-6 6-4 6-1 win over world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the U.S. Open final.

   The second seed recovered from losing the second set and emerged
   victorious from an energy-sapping third to win his 13th grand slam and
   his 22nd consecutive hard-court match.

   The Mallorcan, who added the Flushing Meadows title to the French Open
   crown he clinched earlier this year, now trails only Pete Sampras (14)
   and his great rival Roger Federer (17) in the list of all-time major
   winners.

   He also now holds a significant lead over Djokovic in the race to end
   2013 at the top of the world rankings.

   Not bad for a player whose ability to compete at the highest level was
   called into question in June after a straight-sets defeat to
   [50]135th-ranked Steve Darcis in the first round of Wimbledon.

   "I never thought something like this could happen, I'm so excited to be
   back on tour trying to be competitive," Nadal told the U.S. Open's
   official website after avenging his final defeat to Djokovic in the
   2011 final.

   "But I never thought about competing for what I have competed for this
   year, all the Masters 1000s, two grand slams ... so it is just more
   than a dream for me.

   "I'm very happy for everything. It's true that I worked, but you need
   luck to be where I am today."

   [51]Blog: Can Serena become the greatest ever?

   Six-time grand slam champion Djokovic has now tasted defeat in
   consecutive U.S. Open finals, his latest disappointment coming after
   his loss to Andy Murray in the 2012 title match.

   In fact, the Serb has been in four consecutive finals of the New York
   grand slam, his only victory coming against Nadal two years ago.

   "All the credit to him," said Djokovic after the 37th meeting between
   the two players. "I had my momentum from midway through the second set
   to end of the third where I was supposed to use it and realize the
   opportunities that were presented to me.

   "I didn't do it. I didn't deserve to win in the end.

   "It's obviously disappointing to lose a match like this, but again it
   was a huge privilege and honor to be fighting for this trophy."
