Affidavits: Hannah Anderson's mother, brother 'tortured and killed'

   By Chelsea J. Carter and Mayra Cuevas, CNN
   updated 3:08 PM EDT, Thu August 15, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Warrants reveal authorities found a crowbar near the body of Hannah
       Anderson's mother
     * Authorities suspected the remains of the small child were Hannah's
       brother, papers say
     * After killing Hannah's mother and brother, DiMaggio set fire to his
       house, the affidavits say
     * DiMaggio was shot at least five times, a coroner says

   (CNN) -- The California man who [41]kidnapped 16-year-old Hannah
   Anderson "tortured and killed" her mother and brother before snatching
   her as she left cheerleading practice, according to formerly sealed
   warrants that were released Wednesday.

   Investigators did not detail in the warrants how the torture was
   carried out, but they did reveal new details about how authorities
   believe James Lee DiMaggio carried out the killings and abduction.

   "DiMaggio tortured and killed his best friend's wife and eight-year-old
   son. DiMaggio also shot and killed the family dog," according to one of
   the affidavits. "After the double homicide, DiMaggio set the house on
   fire."

   The details were revealed the same day that a preliminary autopsy
   showed that DiMaggio was shot at least five times by an FBI tactical
   agent during a confrontation in the Idaho wilderness over the weekend.
   That confrontation ended a massive manhunt that began in San Diego
   County, California, after authorities found the bodies of Hannah's
   mother and brother in his burned out home.

   DiMaggio sustained at least five gunshot wounds to his upper torso,
   arms and head, Valley County, Idaho, Coroner Nathan Hess said. An exact
   cause of death will not be formally released until toxicology tests
   have been completed in six to eight weeks, he said.

   The first indication of a problem came the night of August 4, when
   firefighters and sheriff's deputies responded to a report of a fire at
   DiMaggio's log cabin.

   As firefighters were trying to put out the blaze, they noticed flames
   in the home's detached garage, according to search warrant and arrest
   warrant affidavits dated August 6.

   A couple of firefighters quickly doused that fire while others focused
   on putting out the fire engulfing the cabin.

   Inside the garage, a fire captain discovered the body of Hannah's
   mother, 44-year-old Christina Anderson, face down in the garage,
   covered with a tarp. The documents revealed that a crowbar and what
   appeared to be blood were found next to Anderson's head.

   Near the body, sheriff's deputies found the body of a dog covered by a
   sleeping bag, according to the affidavits. What appeared to be blood
   was found near the dog's head, the documents said.

   As firefighters and investigators were making their way through the
   burned out remains of the house, they found the badly burned remains of
   a small child, the affidavits said.

   Authorities issued a nationwide Amber Alert for Hannah and Ethan on
   August 5, but the documents revealed that authorities suspected the
   remains were those of the boy.

   Warrants also were sought by the San Diego County sheriff's
   investigators to place "tap and trace devices" on DiMaggio's e-mail,
   Facebook and cell phone accounts as well as Hannah's phone, e-mail and
   social media accounts.

   In the affidavits, authorities indicated that Hannah's cell phone was
   turned off on the afternoon of August 4, the same day and about the
   same time she was last seen as she was picked up from cheerleading
   practice at her high school. The affidavit does not identify who picked
   her up.

   Shortly before her phone was turned off, there were 13 calls that day
   between Hannah and DiMaggio, according to the warrants.
