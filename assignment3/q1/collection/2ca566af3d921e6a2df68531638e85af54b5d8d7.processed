   Here in Maine a White Christmas appeared overnight - - enough to look
   lovely but not enough to bother getting around (unless you don't know
   how to drive on the stuff).

   Holiday Greetings to all who congregate here . . .

   I really regret never taking calculus! I am feeling out of the loop
   now! Merry Christmas Rachel! and Merry Christmas to the Entire Maddow
   Staff!!!!!

   I *DID* take calculus, but that formula doesn't rise to the "calculus"
   level (that would require summations or integrals and stuff like that).

   That looks more like a PHYSICS formula, but I don't recognize it. Any
   physics geeks out there that can explain if for The Rest of the Class?

   (After further review... much of it is nonsensical. Square root of
   x-squared? 1/y to the -1? Those are more succinctly expressed as "x"
   and "y".)

   Also, capital M is typically the mass of the Earth or other planetary
   body -- whichever you are closest to -- while force divided by
   acceleration is the mass of any object being acted upon by a force.

   r-squared in the numerator would indicate something proportional to the
   surface area of a sphere... such as electric flux through a boundary...

   But, yeah, it is pretty much the math equivalent to stringing together
   random words to pass as a sentence.

   Happy Holidays to all!

   May we all be more observant of the Law of the Prophets in the New
   Year.

   Yeah, I thought that number looked a lot like e, but I wasn't sure.

   Thanks for all that.

   It's definitely nonsense, but it's GOOD nonsense, in the sense that
   there are inside jokes for those who grok the language. I've seen him
   do the same kinds of things with C code.

   Merry Christmas, one and all (and Happy Holidays whatever you choose to
   celebrate this time of year)!

   I'm certainly no "Sheldon Cooper", though I may be a bit of a "physics
   geek" (strictly amateur class). But I can explain the math in this
   Foxtrot strip. In the interest of not spoiling the fun for anyone who
   wants to figure it out on their own, feel free to contact me via my
   Vine page (linked to my "screen name" bold-faced at the top of this
   comment).

   Oh well, just after posting this I noticed that someone above in the
   thread had already posted a reasonably comprehensive explanation
   (should have "refreshed" the page one more time before posting, I
   guess).

   I suppose when it comes to spoiler alerts, it's a bit like the classic
   bit by Steve Martin:

   "Some people have a way with words, and other people... [shrugs
   helplessly]"

   If anyone still has questions after the above explanation, you're still
   welcome to ask me off-blog.

   Merry/Happy/Joyeux/Feliz/Etc.!

   :D

   D'oh! Indeed! John - I really have to start "refreshing" before I post!
   LOL!

   nah, the 'D'OH' was for me. I have use 'physics math' long enough that
   I don't readily see the symbols anymore, so I saw:

   (Mass of the Earth)(natural growth)(some kinda flux)(a doubly inverted
   variable)... etc.

   Sheesh.

   M e r squared = rr (1/y) to the power of -1 = y

   The square root of X squared = X times force over acceleration (mass)

   A very bold equation indeed. It is infinite in compounding interest for
   all, and for all a good night that requires much frozen H2O H2O H2O.

   Am I seduced or reduced?

   [93]the dialogue of the video I posted earlier at msnbc.com.

   Yuk,yuk, yuk! Funny, how geeks always want to over complicate
   everything.Showing off the old academic prowess, yet, they can't
   evacuate urine from a boot with the blueprint on the sole.

   Ho,ho
