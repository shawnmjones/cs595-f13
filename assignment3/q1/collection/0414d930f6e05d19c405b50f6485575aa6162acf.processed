Brutal new jobs report disappoints

   The halcyon days of winter, when the job market was showing sharp
   improvements, seem like a long time ago. The last three months have
   shown one disappointing jobs report after another, each worse than the
   last, with [3]today's new data nothing short of brutal.

   The expectations were that the economy, after a rough April, would
   "[4]snap back in May," producing 150,000 jobs. As of this morning, the
   new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed an economy that
   added less than half that figure: the U.S. created only 69,000 jobs in
   May, while the unemployment rate inched higher to 8.2%.

   As is nearly always the case, there was a gap in the public vs. private
   sectors -- American businesses added 82,000 jobs last month, while the
   government shed 13,000 jobs.

   Common sense suggests policymakers would see data like this and act
   immediately, taking bold steps to boost job creation. Given Republican
   power in Congress, however, that's no longer an option.

   Adding insult to injury, the job totals for both March and April were
   both revised in the wrong direction. There's no sugarcoating today's
   job news -- it's a disaster, and the worst report since May 2011.

   The only Americans thrilled by today's news is Mitt Romney's campaign,
   which needs bad news to advance their ambitions, though I'd remind the
   Republican campaign that, as of this week, taking an economy that was
   losing jobs and turning it into an economy that's adding jobs is [5]a
   sign of success, not failure.

   And with that, here's the chart I run on the first Friday of every
   month, showing monthly job losses since the start of the Great
   Recession. The image makes a distinction -- red columns point to
   monthly job totals under the Bush administration, while blue columns
   point to job totals under the Obama administration.

   Update: Here's another chart, this one showing monthly job losses/gains
   in just the private sector since the start of the Great Recession.

   No more mincing words. The bottom line that the media is blatantly and
   purposefully ignoring is that the Republican Party is on a sabotage
   mission against the American economy. Every single action taken and
   word spoken by Mitt Romney, John Boehner and every Republican in
   Congress is designed to kill as many jobs as possible by the election.
   It's that simple, and that disgusting. These traitors are thrilled with
   such bleak numbers because they know that their master plan is working.
   How are we supposed to grow the economy when the GOP is threatening
   fiscal disaster at every turn and refusing to cooperate with policies
   that actually create jobs?Something needs to be done...

   It is indeed maddening to hear the media, day after day, talk about the
   economy as though Obama is solely responsible for the good or the bad.
   Nary a peep about McConnell's "One Term President" quip, so many years
   ago!

   But "The Media" is a Corporation- "my friend",- and its charter is to
   make money for its shareholders. So we will have a horse race, no
   matter what 'the polls' might say.

   Hercules' Fifth Labor (cleaning the Augean Stables) was a piece of
   cake, compared to Obama's.

   Agreed. Obama is right to blame Congress. I blame Norquist and everyone
   who follows him: the conservative party doesn't care about jobs,
   really, they care more about Winning the Election, and (supposedly)
   Cutting the Deficit (what a crock).

   I read their whole campaign as saying: "As long as the rich get richer,
   forget about safe products, clean air/water/food, affordable health
   care..." We know they won't actually cut spending.

   It's maddening because everything I read says that the Ryan Austerity
   Plan will tank the economy even more.

   We need riots in the streets. Meanwhile this middle-aged-middle-classer
   is trying to reach retirement before I'm 80. So depressing today.

   69,000 jobs - what's brutal about that? 69,000 people now have jobs who
   did not have them last month. Next month will see at least that number
   doubled adding people building new homes or rehabbing those bought at
   foreclosures!

   I've always wondered that same thing.

   Is it as good as expected? No. Is it getting jobs back fast enough? No
   not really.

   But as long as the job gains are greater than the losses, that is still
   a positive (even if just a small positive) as far as I am concerned.

   OK, more jobs is better than nothing, but remember that there's always
   a constant stream of people entering the labor force (mainly HS and
   college grads), not to mention the people on the sidelines who would
   get into the labor force if they could. This is greater than the number
   of new retirees. The economy needs to produce more than 69,000 jobs a
   month to satisfy the net number of new jobseekers. I forget the exact
   number, but I think it's something like 150,000.

   What? President Obama claimed that the recession/unemployment was the
   result of the policies of GWB (although they never show any cause and
   effect with respect to any GWB policy). Then when unemployment goes
   down and President Obama claims the credit. Now that unemployment has
   ticked up today, it is again the fault of the Republicans. So I guess
   the view of the Democrats is that bad things are always the fault of
   someone else and good things are always a result of their actions.

   The reality is that no President can have that much impact in terms of
   his actions resulting in unemployment or increasing employment. Fiscal
   policy can only take you so far in terms of climbing out of a
   recession.

   Historically, the way we got out of recessions was through maintaining
   or increasing government spending - infrastructure and revenue to the
   States to support pay for key services (police, fire, teachers, etc.)
   that support the local economies until the private sector can recover.
   The other thing that got us out was housing - home sales and
   construction.

   With this recession, that key piece - housing - was one of the causes
   and is not available to help us out.

   The Recovery Act (AKA - stimulus) was the effort to maintain government
   spending (revenue to the States), infrastructure and tax cuts to
   individuals to support local economies. At the time it was passed, it
   was a four foot ladder to get us out of a four foot hole. We didn't
   realize until later that the recession was deeper than we thought it
   was. So we had a four foot ladder to get out of an eight foot hole.

   The Obama Administration - backed by lots of rational economists and
   data - realized that additional stimulus effort was needed - a longer
   ladder. The Republicans blocked these additional efforts. This is a
   fact that they freely admit and boast about.

   The Great Recession occurred on President GW Bush's watch. To say that
   President Obama's policies have failed implies that he was able to
   actually implement all of his policies - which is simply not true.

   @ST54, are you serious? Did you even read over what you wrote before
   you posted it? GWB not only slashed taxes (especially on millionaires &
   up), but started 2 wars that were never accounted for, millions of
   dollars were siphoned off by Haliburton among others, etc. - or did you
   sleep thru the first decade of this century?! Frankly democrats haven't
   been in control long enough to create the catastrophe that this
   President inherited.

   The reality is that while the President "doesn't have that much power"
   as you say - it is the actions of Congress that led to policies that
   have not just redistributed income towards the richest 5% with
   billionaires and corporation essentially paying NO taxes! When Nancy
   Pelosi held the gavel more legislation was passed under her reign than
   has been passed since the Great Depression!

   And as most economists will state that "the Stimulus" could have been a
   bit bigger to truly have a long term impact. But we currently have an
   obstinate and traitorous Congress whose sole aim is to defeat this
   President, not to help the people of this nation. Instead of re-framing
   FAUX NOISE talking points you might want to do some independent
   research and actually learn the truth for yourself.

   Zora-how did the two wars (which as you note were not accounted for in
   any normal accounting system), tax cuts etc lead to a recession and
   unemployment?

   My point is that President Obama lays the blame for the recession on
   the "policies" of GWB, wants credit for any decrease in unemployment
   and when unemployment goes back up it, then is still the fault of
   someone else. In my view GWB is no more responsible for the
   unemployment then President Obama is. Both parties blame the other for
   whatever and never share the credit.

   The fact that Republicans want to defeat President Obama is hardly
   surprising. I do not recall in the Democrats during the first term of
   GWB suggesting that he should be elected for a second term.

   Our current economic system is complex and spending (stimulus) in and
   of itself can not reverse a recession. In my view, fiscal policy and
   monetary policy (which it this points has effectively no bullets left)
   can at most lessen the impact of a downturn. As painful as it is ( and
   I have had two of my children in the ranks of the unemployed over the
   last two years) it will simply take time for the recession to "end".
   Although the "end" may not be what we would normally expect. Those of
   use born since 1945 or so have never really seen the "bad times" that
   our parents did in the recession and since that time each recession has
   ended and typically there has been increased economic recovery
   thereafter. This time may be different.

   ST54 - the money spent on those wars was never calculated into the
   deficits, so that by the time the Obama administration started adding
   them in, that deficit that the GOP is crying about most of that was
   inherited from the Bush administration.

   And yes it was the polices that were put forth not just during the Bush
   administration, but Clinton shares some blame for that also. In case
   you don't realize it jobs much of it manufacturing jobs were shipped to
   low/no wage nations, which in turn led to the "laying off" American
   workers. Again this is about "policy" and a tax code that rewarded
   these businesses even as they allowed for the "off-shoring" of jobs.

   Quite frankly, I don't hear the President blaming anyone, but I also
   recognize that the GOP have ensured that not a whole lot of meaningful
   legislation has gotten thru on their watch. As for the
   mis-administration of GWB, he deserves to be in jail, he's the worst
   President in my life-time (I wasn't here before JFK)! The police state
   that we're still living in because of the "Patriot Act" is further
   evidence of his failure to this nation.

   The fact that the GOP have gone to such extra-ordinary lengths to
   defeat this President may not be surprising - but the acrid, rancorous,
   pit-bull waving red meat galvanizing of this man is based solely on his
   color, not his policies! GWB is an idiot, and he ran rough-shod over
   this nation while ensuring the upwards redistribution of wealth to his
   cronies - in other words there were reasons enough that democrats and
   people with conscious should have marching in the streets; this
   President is intelligent, articulate, and while I don't always support
   his positions because this nation's policies have been hi-jacked way
   too far to the right, I still support him over another term of another
   Shrub in the office of the President!

   Our current economic system is built on a Ponzi scheme, it's not
   difficult! We are no longer really able to "produce" enough for our own
   consumption! And yet, our economy is now built around consumption -
   which is why many are carrying debt loads that they cannot afford. And
   contrary to continuing unsustainable tax cuts, along with draconian
   cuts to social programs all while continuing to increase defense
   spending is an anathema that WE as a nation cannot afford!

   It is because WE are in difficult economic times that it is precisely
   the government that must start leading the charge in spending -
   spending to rebuild our infrastructure (roads, schools, bridges, etc.),
   upgrades to our energy grid, R&D into alternative energy, etc.! It is
   what ended up happening to pull this nation out of the GREAT DEPRESSION
   and it's exactly what is needed now, along with closing the tax
   loopholes on the rich and corporate that will help to pull US up out of
   this recession and back onto a more prosperous footing, thereby
   ensuring that future generations won't look back in shame asking "what
   were they thinking".

   Thanks. I do recall hearing President Obama on the campaign trail the
   other day blaming GWB for the "worst" economy since the great
   depression. Again I do not see any connection between GWB "policy" and
   the recession or at least I have yet to see anyone point to a specific
   policy that had a direct connection to the recession. Reducing taxes or
   spending money on a war would not case a recession.

   Infrastructure spending is not a bad thing. And by the way WWII pulled
   us out of the depression not building roads and dams. Prior to WWII the
   US was not the dominate economy in the world. After WWII the US was
   effectively the only economy left standing and in large part the
   general economic prosperity that we have enjoyed since 1950 is a result
   of that fact.

   In any event, building roads etc can only take you so far. As I recall
   the argument against the proposed Canadian pipeline was that the jobs
   created were temporary, the same is true of roads etc.

   While your comment that our economy is a ponzi scheme is interesting
   and in a sense correct, that is the inherent nature of a market economy
   (vs a planned economy).

   The consumption based comment is likely on point. Our economic model
   has changed from (other than in case of food) buying what we produce to
   importing in large measure what we buy. This may be a real sea change.
   That is things may not be the same again.

   So what is the solution- in a sense there is none. The economy- US and
   the world- will be what it will be and people will be impacted
   accordingly. If you increase taxes then what. If those funds are held
   for debt reduction or social security or whatever, then fine. But
   congress (whether republican or democrat) tend to spend what the
   government takes in. I believe that we as individuals make better
   decisions on how to spend our money then the government does. In any
   event, thanks for your comments.

   ST - Over 40,000 plants closed in the U.S. during the last decade, most
   of which was during President Bush's terms of office. Congress, both
   Republicans and Democrats, passed legislation that did not penalize
   American companies for closing plants here and re-opening abroad.
   Deregulation of Wall Street begun during the Clinton era and boosted
   during GWB's terms again, gave Wall Street a pass to indulge in
   practices akin to a casino mentality. With no rules left, they gambled
   away the money that people had invested in their futures - the housing
   market, pensions, etc. If you look at the past history, our nation has
   thrived when tax rates on the wealthiest were raised; jobs were not
   taken away during any of those times; the country's economy allowed the
   middle class to develop and participate in the economy b/c they were
   able to buy the goods and services the corporations made, thereby
   enriching more those that were already wealthy. Congress may spend what
   the government takes in, but they also with Administration policies
   leading the way, spend more, especially if you've reduced the tax rates
   (even by a paltry 4%), pay defense contractors with borrowed money, and
   subsidize prescriptions doing the same thing, all without saying where
   the money would come from to pay off the loans. Then, you say three
   years later, we can't provide a safety net or pay for infrastructure
   jobs (which would go for years, there's so much to be done that would
   put a lot of people to work in many private companies) because the
   deficit is so high! But Vice-President Cheney said "deficits don't
   matter" just a few years ago to justify their spending. I don't know a
   lot about economics and the complexity of different markets, but even I
   can see how the decisions of the last 15 years have caused the
   crippling of our economy. Austerity will not put people back to work
   and neither will more tax cuts for the wealthy. Banks haven't spent the
   $2 Trillion in cash to lend to small businesses or large in three years
   to re-invest in the nation and allow businesses to hire. So, since they
   won't, the federal government has to take the lead again, taking on
   more debt at low rates to do what the banks who were bailed out three
   years ago refuse to do. So, there's complicity among all parties, but
   the Bush Administration and their supporters share a majority of the
   responsibility for many of the problems that confront the Obama
   Administration today.

   GW's policies caused the recession. Obama's policies haven't been
   implemented because the Republican congress rejected them. Therefore,
   we're still suffering from the Bush economy to a large degree. I could
   point at Obama for failing to negotiate with the Republicans better,
   but then there's the long-term Conservative party plan to obstruct
   forever.

   It's almost like we're back to 2011 again. Frankly, aren't we all just
   hoping for good luck on the economy? Obama can't pass stimulus, so he
   really can't do a lot. And Romney doesn't need to do anything but
   cruise and criticize. If Obama's team can't make a better case, then...
   look forward to 2016.

   mistake. Gets to the very heart of any candidacy: its legitimacy.

   Liz Warren's Apology

   By

   Robert E. Brown

   Memo

   Date: May 25, 2012

   To: Citizens of the Commonwealth

   Fm: Elizabeth Warren, Candidate for US Senate

   Re: Clarification, Defense & Apology

   I want to say two things about the questions and concerns that have
   become a persistent distraction in our campaign.

   First, I offer my apology for the confusion and the barrage of
   questions posed by the well-intentioned but not fully informed media.
   The fault, however, has been mostly mine. My fault because the hasty,
   deadline-driven scrum of a press conference has turned out to be a very
   poor environment for responding fully to questions about my heritage
   and my personal, professional and ethnic identity.

   Taking a page from Senator McCain's direct and exhaustive relationship
   to the media, I too am willing to sit face-to-face with reporters and
   stay put until I've answered all their questions. No matter how long
   that takes.

   I am not shocked that my political adversary in this crucial contest of
   words and images should seek advantage from the confusion. The
   citizens' election of a US senator at this critical juncture of
   political, economic and social history is a matter of such great
   consequence that it deserves to be very hard fought.

   Second, I must do something that I have been too slow to do. I must
   explain the choices I've made that have been the subject not only of
   scrutiny but some misunderstanding, whether intentional or not.

   I can briefly summarize these questions, I believe, fairly, and answer
   them.

   The questions resolve themselves to three fundamental concerns: one,
   about the truth of my ethnicity; two, about my ethnicity `s
   relationship to my career as a teacher; and three, about my decision to
   discontinue indicating my ethnicity on annual information forms
   collected by a federal agency.

   These are not unimportant questions, and I take responsibility for not
   responding to them more quickly. But in fairness, these questions and
   concerns fail to recognize an issue of far greater importance than any
   one campaign or the election of even a single US senator. These
   questions of fairness and equality -- whether of ethnic diversity under
   the law, or marriage equality, or gender equity - have been an
   underlying, ongoing debate of American history and jurisprudence from
   the very founding of the nation. In recent decades, the issue of
   racial, ethnic, religious, and gender balance has been decided and
   re-decided at the very highest level of the judicial system.

   Forgive me for taking that paragraph to lecture! I am a teacher, and
   it's the nature of the beast.

   It has been correctly said that context gives meaning. And so my
   answers to the fair and important questions posed about my candidacy
   must, in all fairness, be answered not out-of-context, but fully within
   it.

   Very succinctly, these are my answers to those three crucial questions.

   One, in indicating for the record my ethnicity I have always been
   relying on a source I hold dear: my mother's word. Was my indication
   that there is a Native American portion in my heritage a lie? Simply
   stated: No.

   Two, have I ever gained unfair professional advantage from the
   statement of my ethnicity? There is no evidence whatsoever that my
   ethnicity played any role whatsoever in the decision of my university
   to hire me. It should be remembered that speculations about ethnic
   advantage simply continue the larger and often bitter and divisive
   debate about racial and ethnic diversity in university and other
   employer hiring practices.

   For those who have argued against employment policies such as
   affirmative action, which have been motivated by the desire to correct
   a legacy of discrimination and lack of opportunity, such policies are
   simply wrong. I strongly disagree.

   Three, after having indicated my ethnicity - however relatively small
   and fractional -- why did I discontinue making those indications for
   the record? Very simply put, after quite a number of years with my
   university as a teacher, I recognized that there was no longer any
   reason to indicate the special nature of my ethnicity. As I have stated
   many times in recent weeks, as a new teacher and new member of a
   university community I did believe that I could discover fellow
   employees and colleagues who, like me, had shared their portion of a
   mixed ethnic identity. But after having become a veteran teacher, I
   realized that I had made the transition from rookie hire to recognized
   member of the university community.

   That said, I do want to clarify something else: my desire to serve all
   the citizens of Massachusetts as a senator who will fight for fairness
   and opportunity, and against inequality and exclusion, in government.

   Whenever I specify my race on a form, I casually identify myself as
   white. My wife is casually identified as black, although we both have
   admixtures of other ethnicities. I grew up thinking I was part Cherokee
   on my father's side, but a cousin of mine offered evidence that I was
   not. Recently my son found evidence that I am descended from a
   Massachusetts Indian tribe that sat on the opposite side of the
   Thanksgiving table from my ancestor who came over on the Mayflower. So
   perhaps Elizabeth Warren and I are related through her Indian
   connection. It's too bad I can't vote for her, since my family left
   Massachusetts for the South long ago, but I can hope that my distant
   cousins in Massachusetts (perhaps mutual cousins) will vote for her.

   jobs growth is slow, we need to tell them in congress to STOP talking
   about the economy and Start doing something about it.

   Yes, job growth is a bipolar patient off his meds.

   The three presidential debates in the fall will go a very long way to
   deciding the election. Barring an Israeli strike on Iran's nuke
   facilities, or euro chaos in Europe, or Romney goes rogue and picks
   Trump for running mate, or some other "externality," it's going to come
   down to the perception, trust and faith of the independent voters.

   Both Obama and Romney are trust-deficient. Obama had perception, trust
   and faith, and lost most of it. With independents, Romney's only card
   is anti-Obama sentiment. But otherwise, he's a 'complete unknown, no
   direction home'.

   Which is why the October mano-a-mano can be that three-round
   heavyweight bout that'll decide the championship.

   The Falstaffian abstainer in me relishes this hugely consequential
   election. For those who think it won't really matter who wins, you're
   wrong. Children grow up with a president. They grew up with a Reagan
   culture, a Clinton culture, a George Bush culture, and an Obama
   culture. (I leave out Bush 41 because his presidency seems somehow like
   a cypher, culturally speaking.) But there is quite assuredly an Obama
   culture. And if Romney's elected, there will most certainly be a Romney
   culture. That is the reality, regardless of your politics.

   The Republican jobs effort is working, and Mitch McConnell couldn't be
   happier.

   There are 69,000 jobs won, despite Congress's best efforts to battle
   every initiative this president has proposed. Maybe if they stopped
   fretting over whether birth control should or shouldn't be available
   and started thinking about the American public's needs and priorities
   there'd be more than that. Obama is one man; to expect him to be solely
   responsible for the wellbeing of the economy is laughable.

   Clearly, the Job Creators aren't doing their job.

   This is a little off-topic:

   I found some happy news! In April 2012 - for the first time since
   September 2008 - the Federal budget report shows a surplus (receipts
   greater than outlays)!

   You might be wondering how I know this...

   Over the last several years I have spent time searching for actual real
   data - particularly questions about the Federal Budget. (You know data
   - not spin, opinion, philosophy, lies)

   One of the web pages I found is this one:

   Financial Management Service a Bureau of the Treasury Department

   [92]http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/index.html

   Another great one is an Excel file from:
   [93]http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42911

   This provides PDFs and Excel files from what I think of as the federal
   "bean counters"

   These reports are the monthly outlays and receipts and has WAY more
   information that I can understand (!!). But if you want mind-numbing
   detail about where exactly the money goes or comes from - this is your
   place!

   However, the Monthly Receipts, Outlays, and Deficit or Surplus, Fiscal
   Years 1981-2012 gives information that I find more understandable.

   From 1981 up to September 2008, the monthly deficits bounced around -
   sometimes deficit, sometimes surplus - depending on what bills are paid
   or payments come in (like April tended to be surplus). After September
   2008, the numbers have always been deficit. Until April 2012, when
   there was a surplus.

   Another important thing that this report shows is - contrary to
   "popular if you are a Republican" opinion - the deficit is not due to
   out-of-control wild spending. The deficits increased dramatically
   because of huge drop-off-a-cliff reductions in receipts combined with
   modest increases (TARP, Recovery Act - but primarily mandatory spending
   such as Medicare and "Income Security" - unemployment, food stamps -
   things that must be paid if people qualify for them.)

   By the way, the CBO has quarterly reports with their analysis of the
   effect of the Recovery Act. Excellent - detailed reading.

   There's always a surplus in April. It's tax month you know.

   Most posters here do not remember the Great Depression, neither do I
   but I do know that in started after the stock market crash in 1929 and
   lasted through the 30's until this country entered WWII. Today we are
   comming off the worst recession since that time and everyone thinks we
   can solve the problem in 3 years. That might have happened if Obama had
   not had the anchor of the Republican party hanging around his neck
   making progress all but impossible. The Speaker even tried to blame the
   President because Congress had not acted on the shortage of cancer
   drugs. I fear for the future of this country if Romney gets elected
   especially if he gets a majority in Congress because then it will be a
   one party monarchy which is what the Republicans want.

   So then the answer out of our mess is WWIII? I can see BO starting a
   war with Syra or Iran and even both to save his job.

   Gee, Hank, that's what Senator McCain would have done if he was
   currently the President and what Governor Romney's advisors and he have
   been pushing, as well. If President Obama did do so, would you applaud
   him since it's what the Republicans are calling him out to intervene?

   Does anyone know the sampling error in this unemployment figure? I
   believe it is a poll and most polls are +/- 3%. Seems to me 1/10 of 1%
   does not mean anything.

   Agreed...gaining 69k jobs for a month compared to 800k jobs being lost
   in Dec 2008 when Bush left..I'd say we're doing pretty good considering
   Repubs dont and ever want to cooperate.
