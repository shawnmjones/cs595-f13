   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [44]Tagging tips - [45]Search For Tags - [46]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   I was hoping for some sort of punchline there... there really isn't

       Americans will be better off with power generation that is not
       redundantly enriching the same 8 old guys.
       DEcentralized profits will create more jobs and spread the wealth

       Corn is NOT the only source of biofuel, not by a longshot, and in
       fact is one of the least workable sources in the long term. It was
       and is, however, practical NOW while other sources ramp up. Corn is
       heavily subsidized in the US and grown in abundance, and so it made
       sense to start there. Sugar cane is a much better option, and when
       they become viable so will cellulose (plant waste) and algae.
       Fossil fuels took a while to reach the level of optimization they
       enjoy now, give the new technology some time to catch up before you
       dismiss it wouldja?
       Additionally, corn used for biofuel isn't wasted as foodstuff.
       "Spent" grain from biofuel production is still perfectly fit as
       livestock feed, meaning if all the corn marked for livestock feed
       were first run through an ethanol plant we would lose nothing
       whatsoever.
       The oil industry has been spreading these anti-biofuel myths for a
       while now, because it threatens their bottom line. Don't believe
       it.

       When I googled this to check my memory of an old science article I

     Grass Biofuels 'cut CO2 by 94%'
     Producing biofuels from a fast-growing grass delivers vast savings
     of carbon dioxide emissions compared with petrol, a large-scale
     study has suggested.
     A team of US researchers also found that switchgrass-derived ethanol
     produced 540% more energy than was required to manufacture the fuel.
     One acre (0.4 hectares) of the grassland could, on average, deliver

   and it biodegrades if spilled. Not at all the same thing. Plus that
   just means that the jobs situation isn't either-or, it's both-and if we
   do green tech.

   Here in Maryland, they are attacking the rise in gasoline taxes that
   our governor wants, which is to be expected.  But they are also
   attacking a planned rise in public transit fares as NOT BEING HIGH
   ENOUGH!!  Guess none of their followers use public transit.

 good, but it'd been even nicer as a triptych ([275]0+ / 0-)

   with two "Brown Jobs", the other one being a poorly (media) covered but

 Waste of time ([279]0+ / 0-)

   Arguing against the pipeline is, in my humble opinion, a total waste of
   time.  Silliness, as evidenced by the above cartoon, only makes
   opponents seem desperate and intractable.  Look, I don't like it.  I
   have pipeline through my property and I would rather not have it, but
   it's there and has been for years and there has been no (or very
   little) problem.

   So, blowing your stack by asserting that one pipeline carrying junk
   from a part of the continent most of us will never see is a losing
   proposition.

   Want to fight for bigger tax credits on solar and wind? I'm with you.

   Want to raise the gas tax through the roof? I'm already there.

   But really, pick the fights that matter and the ones that you can win.

 Keystone will create a lot more than 35 jobs ([282]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [283]Steve Canella

   Especially when it starts to leak.  You'll have LOTS of
   publically-financed environmental clean-up jobs then.   Remember, the
   proposed pipeline will have 50% larger capacity than regular pipelines
   because they want to use 36-inch diameter pipe instead of standard
   30-inch diameter pipe.  We won't have any data on how that big of a
   pipe will behave when it's out in the real world, running without
   supervision.

 I've always loved green technology ([296]0+ / 0-)

   Not even for the environmental benefits, more for the innovation it
   requires (and fosters), the cool jobs green tech creates, and the
   overall look of green tech. It's just such a hopeful, optimistic field.

   Too bad my state, which is uniquely suited for most of those kinds of
   energy, won't lift a finger to help out green tech.

 sometimes a cartoon isn't meant to be funny ([299]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [300]Hopeful Skeptic

   I appreciate the critics in the thread... and sorry this one didn't
   have the punchline some desired. I do four cartoons a week or so and
   each one works (or sometimes doesn't work) in different ways.

   I have to say sometimes the simple ones seem to have the biggest effect
   and reach more people.  It's possible to get too clever and too
   satirical and maybe that works for you sophisticates on the DK but for
   the general audience those often don't work.

   On the actual politics of this one, yes it oversimplifies -- it's a
   cartoon.  But the basic point I think is totally fair.  If we just do
   what we've always done then our future will certainly by a lot browner
   and hotter.  Keystone is clearly a case of taking that path.

   Proactive governments can do a lot more.  Thanks to a very aggressive
   move by the government in Germany they have a remarkable transit
   system, photovoltaics on nearly every home and are well on their way to
   that greener future.  If the money we've spent on our oil wars had been
   used to something like that here we'd have a way greener and healthier
   economy here.

   That said, I promise to try and be funnier for you all--- I agree,
   funnier is certainly better.

 What will you give? ([303]0+ / 0-)

   The true question to ask, is what will we as a society be willing to do
   to make a clean energy future a reality. We have to be willing to
   recycle and reuse. We have to be willing to give up our cars, no-matter
   how powered. We have to be willing to live with and accept others. Only
   then will our collective demands on the planet be lowered to a
   sustainable level.
