   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Dr. Kermit Gosnell is on trial on eight counts of murder in eight
       deaths
     * The deaths are those of seven babies and a 41-year-old woman
     * The woman had gone to Gosnell's clinic for an abortion
     * Trial testimony Tuesday came from the woman's 26-year-old daughter

   Philadelphia (CNN) -- When Yashodo Gurung left her mother's side at a
   West Philadelphia abortion clinic, she thought the 41-year-old woman
   was napping while she awaited her medical procedure.

   But now, as testimony Tuesday in the trial of the clinic's doctor
   indicated, Gurung wonders if maybe her mother was in fact dead when
   Gurung was asked by a staffer at the Women's Medical Society to return
   to the waiting room at the front of the clinic.

   "I thought she was peaceful and sleeping," the a 26-year-old Bhutanese
   refugee said through a translator, wiping her eyes with a tissue.

   Dr. Kermit Gosnell faces eight counts of murder in the deaths of seven
   babies and that of Gurung's mother, Karnamaya Mongar, of Virginia, who
   died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion.

   Authorities accuse Gosnell, 72, of [41]using scissors to sever the
   spinal cords of fetuses who emerged from their mothers still alive.

   Abortion doctor's 'house of horrors'
   Abortion doctor charged with murder

   He has pleaded not guilty. His defense attorney, Jack McMahon, has
   maintained that none of the infants was killed; rather, they were
   already deceased as a result of Gosnell previously administering an
   abortion drug.

   Mongar died November 19, 2009, after overdosing on anesthetics
   prescribed by the doctor, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams
   said following the arrest of Gosnell and before a gag order was put in
   place preventing attorneys and now jurors from speaking to the media.
   Williams called the facility "a house of horrors" that performed
   "botched and illegal abortions" and that was full of containers of
   fetuses' body parts.

   Born in Bhutan, Mongar spent 18 years living in a bamboo hut in a
   Nepalese refugee camp before coming to the United States in July 2009
   as part of a humanitarian resettlement program, the family's attorney,
   Bernard Smalley, told CNN in 2011 following the release of the grand
   jury report. The mother of three and grandmother of one was 19 weeks
   into her pregnancy when she went to Gosnell's practice.

   Gurung testified that while she waited with her mother for several
   hours, she saw her mother given multiple doses of medicine in pill
   form. Gurung also saw her mother receive additional medication
   intravenously through an IV line inserted in Mongar's hand.

   Mongar's brother, Damber Ghalley, who speaks English, also testified
   Tuesday. Ghalley told jurors he took Mongar to Gosnell's practice two
   days in a row.

   After hours inside the clinic during the second visit, Ghalley was
   waiting outside in his car when things turned chaotic as an ambulance
   and firefighters arrived on the scene, he said.

   "I knew something was wrong when I saw the ambulance," Ghalley
   testified, adding that firefighters had to use bolt cutters to open a
   padlocked emergency exit just to get Mongar out of the clinic on a
   stretcher.

   Ghalley said he saw Gosnell standing inside the doorway asked him what
   was happening.

   "He (Gosnell) said the procedure was done but 'Your sister's heart
   stopped,'" Ghalley said.

   Jurors also heard from Gosnell's former maintenance man, Jimmy Johnson,
   who testified that his duties included removing the biohazard waste
   from the exam rooms. Johnson said that the toilets inside the clinic
   would be "stopped up" at least twice a week.

   "When I plunged it once, particles came up," Johnson said.

   "What kind of particles," assistant district attorney Edward Cameron
   asked.

   "An arm came up," Johnson replied.

   Also on trial is Eileen O'Neill, 56, a medical school graduate who
   worked as a doctor at Gosnell's clinic. O'Neill, who did not have a
   medical license, is charged with participating in the operation of a
   "corrupt organization."

   If found guilty, Gosnell could be sentenced to death.
