Religious right leader backs Russian crackdown on gay rights

   The crackdown on gay rights on Russia is [3]stunning in its scope, and
   offers a reminder that Russia "remains a country where discrimination
   and even violence against gay people are widely tolerated." But while
   much of the West has condemned Vladimir Putin's new efforts, the
   offensive is not without American backers.

   Voice of Russia is the government's official international radio
   broadcasting service, and last week, it [4]ran a report touting
   comments from the American Family Association's Bryan Fischer, a
   prominent leader of the religious right movement here in the U.S., who
   spoke to VOR at some length.

     "Russia is not being homophobic, it's homorealistic -- the Russian
     government is trying to take the issue into consideration and
     establish public policy to contribute to public health, as this
     lifestyle is not be promoted, endorsed or granted special legal
     protection", the expert said, warning of high health risks linked to
     this lifestyle.

     He cites the Center for Disease Control that has monitored the HIV
     epidemic since 1987 and determined that 61% of HIV-positive males
     had sexual contacts with other males. "Homosexual behavior is just
     as risky as drug abuse," Fischer said.

     "I think the Russian government is right to be concerned with
     propaganda on teenagers who are at the age of struggling through
     sexual identity issue and we should help to channel these urges in
     productive behavior. Heterosexuality is God's design. Policies that
     encourage young people to think this are good ideas."

   The headline on the Voice of Russia report described Fischer as an
   "expert," which is an accurate label if you define "expert" as
   "unhinged radio activist on the laughed-at fringes of American
   society."

   Note, Fischer's not the only one in the U.S. cheering Russia on. As we
   [5]talked about a while back, the Catholic Family and Human Rights
   Institute said it "admires" Russia's anti-gay moves; Peter LaBarbera of
   Americans for Truth About Homosexuality lauded Russia for rejecting
   "America's reckless and decadent promotion of gender confusion"; and
   the Illinois-based World Congress of Families has scheduled its 2014
   conference for the Kremlin.

   And then, of course, there's evangelical activist Scott Lively.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If Lively's name sounds familiar, it's probably because of his work in
   Uganda, where he brags he is known as the "father" of the anti-gay
   movements. When Uganda took up a "Kill the Gays" bill, proponents said
   it arose out of an anti-gay conference that Lively headlined in 2009.
   Earlier this year, the Washington Post [6]reported that Lively has
   spent the last decade working "systematically to strip away human
   rights protections from LGBT people" around the world, becoming "a kind
   of persecution consultant, strategizing with influential leaders and
   cohorts in other countries about ways to further silence and remove
   LGBT people from basic protections of the law."

   And wouldn't you know it, Lively conducted a 50-city speaking tour of
   Russia in 2007, where he recommended the very measures Russia is now
   pursuing. From [7]an AP report last year:

     "Russia could become a model pro-family society," he wrote. "If this
     were to occur, I believe people from the West would begin to
     emigrate to Russia in the same way that Russians used to emigrate to
     the United States and Europe." [...]

     "Russians, even after glasnost, are comfortable with an
     authoritarian style," he said. "That wouldn't work in the United
     States."

   Let those quotes roll around in your mind for a moment. Lively thinks
   it's possible that Americans would emigrate to Russia because of its
   anti-gay policies, and he sounds a little disappointed that Americans
   aren't more accepting of Russia's authoritarian tendencies.

   Pope says about gays "Who am I to judge?" then the Cathoic Family and
   Human Rights Institute says they admire russia's stance? Why does the
   Catholic media have bring the Pope's message down... Damn it!

   Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church is nothing more than Homophobic
   brutes.... The right wing media are afriad their own secrets will come
   out... They throw stodes in their glass houses... the more they do it,
   the more the righties will lose their influence... once upon the time
   Republics tried for every vote they could get... Now they are satified
   if they can get 100% of the bigoted right wingh wife beating homophobe
   vote.... you know because of freedom... and fight the president on
   account of black...

   If they trule believe in God then they should fear one day God will say
   to them

   Ffor I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and
   you gave Me nothing to drink; I was a stranger, and you did not invite
   Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you
   did not visit Me. "Then they themselves also will answer, 'Lord, when
   did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or
   in prison, and did not take care of You?' "Then He will answer them,
   'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the
   least of these, you did not do it to Me.'

   Finally, a solution to the problem of so many unhappy Republicans and
   ultra-conservatives in America. Emigration to Russia is just the thing
   for them. It's a great place to experience all that government control
   of social and personal life that Republicans crave, the awesome single
   party system that eliminates voting concerns, and just the kind of
   corruption conservatives understand and love. Why didn't we think of
   this earlier? Instead of another Civil War, we can just ship the entire
   South and Bible Belt over there. And the Gulags! Don't forget the
   fabulous prison system waiting for them.

   That was my suggestion when I first heard of this.

   Wow, you too can just move to Russia if you like the anti-gay stuff so
   much!

   A great twist on the ultra RW "love it or leave it" mentality.

   This is very interesting that those that think better dead than red and
   so rapt with the idea that Russia's laws are good for America to adopt.

   I like to think showcasing the right wing version of religion is very
   similar to theological dictatorship. Yes, I have heard for years about
   the RW religious (not Christianity or general religion) similarity to
   Taliban.

   How do these people call themselves Christians or Catholics? Shame on
   our Cardinals, Bishops and Priests for not speaking out against the
   bigotry, racism, hatred and fear being spewed by people like this? I
   was taught by Priests and Nuns that God made us all in his image.
   Doesn't that means he is black, white, brown, yellow, he is of all
   religions, he is male and female, he is heterosexual, bisexual and
   homosexual. So hating anyone of us is hating God, condemning any race,
   religion, group or gender is condemning God.

   The Church has become a host for hatred, fear mongering, racism and
   bigotry and this is why people are turning away.

   Most Russians are Orthodox, of course, rather than Catholic (and there
   are some growing numbers of evangelical Protestant groups).

   Religion isn't the problem -- ignorant bigotry is the problem. It's
   easy to find bigots using religious language to justify their ignorant
   prejudice and hate, but the "atheist" Soviet Union didn't have a
   stellar record vis-a-vis tolerance, either.

   Most offensive here is the phrase: "teenagers who are at the age of

   offensive and scientifically incorrect.

   We can always hope that Lively is right and all these crazies will
   become a Russian problem and leave the rest of us alone. Has Mr. Lively
   emigrated yet? If not perhaps we can pool together and send him a one
   way ticket for him, his family and his possessions. Perhaps the State
   Department should look at who is travelling and why. Hate speech
   mongers should not be able to freely go to other countries and spread
   their hate. Everyone knows that it is easy to blame others for the
   shortcomings of your own life and these people and their hate speech
   give the reasons it should be gays. Surely if they were going to these
   countries and speaking about Jews, Catholics or Evangilists like this
   the Government of the US would have something to say about it. It would
   have the same effect too, someone to blame for their woes. Governments
   will pounce on anything and anyone to blame for the problems as long as
   it diverts the eyes from them. Every government in the world does it
   and it is so easy. Just pick a group and say it is them often enough
   and everyone will start to believe it. Make laws against defending that
   group and you have it made. No one dares to speak up for them. Then
   kill them or torture them or leave them to rot in some dreadful jail.
   Life does not get any better for the people of that country but at
   least the people forget for a while who is at fault for their misery
   and place the blame elsewhere.

   We Americans, who actually believe in the constitution and civil
   liberties, should ship these so-called "ministeries" to Russia. There
   they will enjoy a life free from the 'evil influences of homosexuality'
   and civil rights. I'm willing to start a fundraising program dedicated
   to giving these zealots what they want: a free ticket to a toletarian
   society.

   What the religious right doesn't understand - yet, is that their
   rehtoric and idiotic statements, such as the ones featured in this
   story, are helping to drive a new generation far and away from
   religion. In a few years, say ten or fifteen, the religious right will
   be on the fringes of society - American society. They will have little
   to no influence over the political discourse in this country and will
   be viewed by the majority as radical fundamentalist, dedicated to
   hatred, intolerance and ignorance. For that, I thank them.

   As one of the younger generation who has become disgusted with the
   sheer amount of hypocracy from organized Western religions (though I am
   still quite spiritual), I second that statement.

   Down with churches that think it's their "God-given right" to determine
   who you can love (and make love with), who you can be friends with,
   what you can do with your body, and every aspect of your waking and
   sleeping life. Up with spirituality on your OWN terms.

   Unfortunately, I think it will take longer than 10 to 15 years for the
   zealots to be pushed to the sidelines in politics. Probably more like
   50.

   It's actually rather sad, because what you say is very true...it is
   driving people further and further away from religion, makes you wonder
   if that isn't really their master plan, because they aren't really
   living up to true Christian values...as someone else said, Pharisees,
