[22]McConnell campaign manager mum on role in alleged Ron Paul payola scheme

   Popcorn in a bowl
   Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann, Mitch McConnell and payola?!? What's not to
   love?
   [29]Washington Post:

     A well-known conservative state senator in Iowa who abruptly dropped
     his support for Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) in the 2012
     presidential campaign and backed Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) just days
     before the Iowa caucuses allegedly sought payments from the Paul
     campaign in return for his endorsement, according to materials
     published this week.

     State Sen. Kent Sorenson wanted to be paid $8,000 a month through
     the fall of 2012 and receive a $100,000 donation for his leadership
     PAC, according to an e-mail that one of his associates wrote on Oct.
     29, 2011, to John Tate, Paul's campaign manager. The e-mail was
     published by the conservative site TheIowaRepublican.com and
     OpenSecrets.org, the Web site of the nonpartisan Center for
     Responsive Politics.

   Sorenson ended up endorsing Paul's campaign in December, 2011, after
   which Bachmann instantly accused him of taking cash to switch teams.
   Sorenson, however, denies taking any money and says there was never a
   payola scheme.

   But according to Dennis Fusaro, a former Ron Paul aide who went public
   this week with allegations of the pay-to-play scheme, Sorenson is not
   telling the truth. To support his claim, Fusaro released [30]emails and
   [31]an audio recording of a phone call that he says was between
   Sorenson and himself.

   If the emails and audio recording prove to be authentic, it not only
   undermines Sorenson's claim, but could create a problem for former Ron
   Paul campaign chairman Jesse Benton--who is now Senate Minority Leader
   Mitch McConnell's campaign manager. That's because one of the emails
   released by Fusaro shows that Benton was familiar with at least some of
   Sorenson's terms and conditions for joining the Paul campaign, yet
   nonetheless urged Sorenson to "revisit ... joining our team." Benton
   did not explicitly reference any cash offer, but his language makes it
   clear that he believed something was on the table. "The window is sill
   [sic] open, but it will close in the next few days," Benton wrote.

   In addition to the email, Fusaro released [32]a telephone conversation
   between Sorenson and himself. In the conversation, Fusaro and Sorenson
   discuss a $30,000 check that a Ron Paul aide had delivered to Sorenson
   after his endorsement. Sorenson asks Fusaro whether Ron Paul's inner
   circle is aware of the check, which he said he would not cash, and
   Fusaro responds in the affirmative, saying that he thinks Benton was
   aware of it. Sorenson concurs: "Oh, I know that Jesse knows. I know
   Jesse knows."

   Thus far, Benton has remained silent about the allegations that he was
   involved in and aware of the payola scheme. According to The Washington
   Post, neither he nor McConnell's campaign have responded to inquiries
   about the allegations. However, in an email released by Fusaro, Benton
   did say that his former colleague was "an insane and delusional
   person," adding that he hopes he "will get help."

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       no doubt this is merely a smear campaign against St. Ron, whose
       halo lifts him far above such mortal concerns.
       Of course, to the rest of us, this just merely confirms what we
       already knew - that at worst, Paul is just another dirty grifter
       politician (and a bigoted one at that), and at best is an
       absolutely horrible judge of character and a totally incompetent
       manager of his staff and business dealings.

       for these exact reasons.
       That being said, Jesse Benton couldn't lead a campaign out of a wet
       paper bag. He rode the coattails of Ron Paul's revolutionary
       e-campaign manager Justin Lim (inventor of the money bomb and using
       MeetUp as a virtual phone treet) and others.
       He, of course, took total credit and even married Ron Paul's
       granddaughter.
       Funny enough, anyone outside of Ron Paul's very, very small inner
       circle in 2008 have left politics all together.
       Except Jesse, because Jesse, well, Jesse see politics as a cash cow
       and ain't above milking a bull for a few dollars more.
       Contrary to popular belief, zombies are quite intelligent and excel
       in anagrams.

       I'm pretty sure recording without mutual knowledge and consent (or
       a court order) is a violation in many other jurisdictions as well.

       an Iowa senate ethics investigation for taking money from the
       Bachmann campaign. It was against senate rules. I don't think
       there's any law against taking money for an endorsement. One thing
       seems clear: neither Bachmann nor Ron Paul got the money's worth
       from Sorenson. Neither his campaign aid for Bachmann nor his last
       minute endorsement of Paul was worth spit.

       Tweety boldly predicted on his show last night that Paul would be
       the GOP nominee in 2016. He (Tweety) also mentioned that he does
       this for a living and we should believe it 'cause he said it. Maybe
       they paid him off too.

   Beyond that?

   We'll just have to watch the pieces fall.

   From here in Chicagoland, it's hard not to be cynical and expect all of
   the pieces to fall. After all, this is the land of Blagojevich and Ryan

 Sure, quid pro quo...but cash payment? ([400]0+ / 0-)

   Of course bartering is the art of politicking.

   And I expect that finagling donations to one's favorite PACs is pretty
   common. That help to buy influence in wider circles.  Though not sure
   if this was a direct PAC donation from Pauls' campaign; probably more
   likely occurs from a campaign's closely-aligned donor.

   What I expect is unusual about this situation and belies "everyone does
   it" is the barefaced $8k stipend like this case.   Two words comes to
   mind: Greed and stupidity.
