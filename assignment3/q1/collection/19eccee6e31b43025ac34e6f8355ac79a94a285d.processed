   levels of gun violence.

   In the aftermath of mass shootings and other gun-related tragedies,
   there is often a surge of interest on the part of community leaders,
   social-science researchers, and elected officials to root out the
   causes of gun violence in an effort to prevent such tragedies from
   occurring again. Any study into the causes of gun violence is
   necessarily complicated, however, as there are innumerable factors that
   contribute to the nature and prevalence of gun-related violence in any
   community.

   Despite this complex web of factors that influence the rate of gun
   violence, this report finds a clear link between high levels of gun
   violence and weak state gun laws. Across the key indicators of gun
   violence that we analyzed, the 10 states with the weakest gun laws
   collectively have an aggregate level of gun violence that is more than
   twice as high--104 percent higher, in fact--than the 10 states with the
   strongest gun laws.

   The data analyzed in this report relate to the following 10 indicators
   of gun violence:
    1. Overall firearm deaths in 2010
    2. Overall firearm deaths from 2001 through 2010
    3. Firearm homicides in 2010
    4. Firearm suicides in 2010
    5. Firearm homicides among women from 2001 through 2010
    6. Firearm deaths among children ages 0 to 17, from 2001 through 2010
    7. Law-enforcement agents feloniously killed with a firearm from 2002
       through 2011
    8. Aggravated assaults with a firearm in 2011
    9. Crime-gun export rates in 2009
   10. Percentage of crime guns with a short "time to crime" in 2009

   Using these data, we rank each state according to the rate of each
   indicator of gun violence and create an overall ranking of the states
   across all 10 indicators, resulting in an overall state ranking for the
   prevalence of gun violence. Finally, we compare this overall state
   gun-violence ranking with a Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ranking
   of states based on the strength of their gun laws.

   Our analysis determined that the following are the 10 states, by rank,
   that suffer the highest levels of gun violence:
    1. Louisiana
    2. Alaska
    3. Alabama
    4. Arizona
    5. Mississippi
    6. South Carolina
    7. New Mexico
    8. Missouri
    9. Arkansas
   10. Georgia

   The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence analysis shows that eight of
   these states are among the 25 states with the weakest gun laws.

   While the strength of a state's gun laws is just one factor in the
   prevalence of gun-related violence in the state and cannot alone
   account for gun violence, there is a clear link between weak gun laws
   and high levels of gun violence across the United States.

   the Center. Charles Posner is the State Communications Assistant at the
   Center.

   * Correction, April 22, 2013: This report incorrectly stated the
   national average of law-enforcement agents feloniously killed with a
   firearm from 2002 through 2011. The correct average is 0.2 per 100,000
   people.
