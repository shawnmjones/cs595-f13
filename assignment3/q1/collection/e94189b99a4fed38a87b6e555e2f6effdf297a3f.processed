   night owls
   Fifty years ago, on June 12, 1963, white supremacist Byron De La
   Beckwith shot civil rights leader Medgar Evers in the driveway of his
   home in Jackson, Mississippi. At the hospital an hour later, he was
   pronounced dead at age 37. I was just 16. But that killing and the
   speech of Martin Luther King Jr. just two months later in Washington,
   D.C., permanently catalyzed my activist side and would, a year later,
   take me to Jackson to register voters for Freedom Summer amid the
   search for three other civil rights workers we all knew to be dead long
   before their bodies were dug out of an earthen berm.

   Ten years before, in 1954, Evers had become the first NAACP field
   secretary in Mississippi history. It was obviously a dangerous post.
   The Klan was not a memory in the Magnolia State, it was a living
   entity, and plenty of whites unwilling to join its ranks openly
   sympathized with its objectives of keeping the black population "in its
   place." Evers traveled across the state, bolstering brave activists
   with his optimism and cheerfulness and good sense. Despite the risks to
   them, he managed to get a few to sign onto civil rights lawsuits and
   buy NAACP membership cards.

   Bolstered himself by his wife Myrlie, Evers did what he could to
   investigate and get out the word on the frequent barbarities and other
   injustices committed against blacks by private citizens and officials
   alike. It was a time when the alternate uniform for many police
   officers was a sheet and there was little help to be found in a
   criminal-justice system populated itself with criminals operating under
   the color of Jim Crow law. Evers would not live to see those statutes
   outlawed. But his wife [29]carried on, as she still does, age 80.

            IFRAME: [30]http://www.youtube.com/embed/3NDThlgXKoM

   "Only A Pawn In Their Game"

   A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers' blood
   A finger fired the trigger to his name
   A handle hid out in the dark
   A hand set the spark
   Two eyes took the aim
   Behind a man's brain
   But he can't be blamed
   He's only a pawn in their game.

   The rest of the lyrics are below the fold..

   Corey Dade at The Root writes--[31]Fifty years after the activist's
   death, landmark policies he championed may be struck down by SCOTUS:

    Uncertainty hovers over observances that began at Evers' gravesite at
    Arlington National Cemetery last week, as the civil rights community
   warily awaits rulings that might fundamentally change, if not outright
    limit, minorities' access to college and participation in elections.
   Before the end of June, the court will decide the constitutionality of
     race as a factor used in admissions at the University of Texas. The
    justices also will rule on Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which
         requires states and smaller jurisdictions with a history of
     discrimination to obtain federal approval before changing election
                                 procedures.

   Some justices on the conservative-leaning court have openly questioned
    or criticized the continued need for special protections for minority
     voters. And although the court upheld racially conscious admission
     policies in 2001, multiple lower-court rulings and state laws have
       narrowed or banned such affirmative action practices at public
                                universities.

      Both cases threaten the legacy of Evers, the NAACP's first field
     secretary in 1950s' Mississippi, whose work became a model for many
     successful challenges of Jim Crow laws across the South. He was the
   first known African American to apply to the University of Mississippi
   School of Law; he helped James Meredith integrate the university as an
        undergraduate student; he sued the city of Jackson, Miss., to
   desegregate its public schools; and he called for equal access to city
       jobs and accommodations. Evers also registered blacks to vote.

   The lawsuit challenging the Voting Rights Act also threatens the legacy
       of Attorney General Eric Holder, who spoke at the wreath-laying
   ceremony for Evers at Arlington National Cemetery. Holder is the named
    defendant in the lawsuit because the Justice Department enforces the
                             Voting Rights Act.

   The Justice Department has aggressively used Section 5 to block a wave
     of Republican-led state laws over the past couple of years, such as
   photo-identification requirements for voters, arguing that the measures
                  would disproportionately harm minorities.

    Holder has defended his agency's efforts and cites as one of his most
    important accomplishments the rebuilding of the Justice Department's
    civil rights division following the Bush administration. At Arlington
    last week, Holder praised Evers as a pioneer who laid the groundwork
          for many of the civil rights gains of the past 50 years.

   [32]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2002--Gangbanger
   of Doom:

      The must-visit Media Whores Online has the following post today:

     CBS News is now reporting utter chaos has overtaken the White House
    efforts to scare the American public and to protect its own political
            rump with the alleged Jose Padilla "dirty bomb" plot.
                                    [...]
     CBS News Correspondent Jim Stewart reports some U.S. officials now
    admit they're not sure what Padilla's plans were when he returned to
                            the U.S. last month.

    MWO also includes a link to the actual article, but the story doesn't
       include the information mentioned above, apparently edited out.
                               Interesting...
     In any case, as I mentioned yesterday, this arrest of a small-time
    gangbanger is hardly the triumph over terror the administration would
     have us believe. It's designed to take pressure off Bush, the 9-11
         hearings, Enron, and every other ill currently plaguing the
     administration. And the press and public lap it up. Unbelievable...

   On today's [35]Kagro in the Morning show, it's all about the NSA story
   again. And once again, Greg Dworkin and Armando pitch in on the
   discussion. Greg did bring us the top non-NSA story of the day, though,
   that being the Justice Department's Plan B reversal, plus some new and
   longer-term polling data on approval/disapproval of surveillance
   activity. From there on, though, it's all NSA, and another expansive
   discussion of the discussion (which might possibly constitute
   meta-data), including looks at the much-maligned takes of Jennifer
   Rubin and David Brooks.

   A South politician preaches to the poor white man
   "You got more than blacks, don't complain
   You're better than them, you been born with white skin" they explain
   And the Negro's name
   Is used it is plain
   For the politician's gain
   As he rises to fame
   And the poor white remains
   On the caboose of the train
   But it ain't him to blame
   He's only a pawn in their game.

   The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
   And the marshals and cops get the same
   But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool
   He's taught in his school
   From the start by the rule
   That the laws are with him
   To protect his white skin
   To keep up his hate
   So he never thinks straight
   'Bout the shape that he's in
   But it ain't him to blame
   He's only a pawn in their game.

   From the powerty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
   And the hoof beats pound in his brain
   And he's taught how to walk in a pack
   Shoot in the back
   With his fist in a clinch
   To hang and to lynch
   To hide 'neath the hood
   To kill with no pain
   Like a dog on a chain
   He ain't got no name
   But it ain't him to blame
   He's only a pawn in their game.

   Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
   They lowered him down as a king
   But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
   That fired the gun
   He'll see by his grave
   On the stone that remains
   Carved next to his name
   His epitaph plain:
   Only a pawn in their game.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   But what's a bit of boiling excrement among friends?  Believe it or
   not, ZJW+#H+ R+W+T+X+T+, or said boiling poo, is actually, truly a
   phrase from Talmud, and has to do with the Jewish equivalent of Dante's
   next-to-deepest basement, reserved for those of my folks who eat Big
   Macs or convert to Catholicism.  Also, scoffing at the sages will get
   us there.  Unlike Christianity's eternal Hell, our sentence is of
   limited duration, although I think the Catholics might have borrowed
   Purgatory from us, in a tweaked sense.

   I think I'm okay, because I've never had pork, never tasted a Big Mac,
   and only enter Catholic churches as a tourist to admire the stone
   carving and metalwork (but the statues and some of the priests give me
   the creeps), and I honestly respect our sages, many of whom were far,
   far ahead of their times.

   Another diary here today, one pointing out a misspelling (comandment
   [sic]) on the dust jacket of a book written by some Christian fundy
   lunatic of whom I never heard until today, got me thinking about the
   Jewish laws, and how onerous Paul painted them to be in his writings.
   They really aren't onerous.  There are 613 laws in the Torah, most of
   which are easy to follow out of habit, and most of which don't even
   apply today because we have no Temple.  The onerous part of being a Jew
   has nothing to do with our laws, but with the pogroms and related
   intercultural difficulties, which ebb and flow like tides, but never
   truly disappear.

   The rest of you have it much easier.  There are no 10 Commandments for
   gentiles.  Only seven, most of which are fairly easy.  No idolatry, no
   murder, no theft, no sexual immorality (that one causes much debate
   these days, but it's not my business), no blasphemy, be humane to
   animals (literally, no eating flesh from still-living animals, but the
   concept is simply treating animals with respect), and establish a just
   legal system.  The first five are negative or prohibitional laws; the
   last two are positive.

   The last two explain why there are so many of my folks involved in PETA
   and other animal welfare causes, and why so many of us work as lawyers
   or activists for social welfare causes -- those are common ground,
   Torah laws in which we can work together with people of all belief
   systems to improve the world, a little at a time.

   Hmph, long-winded again.  And straying.  And all because of a holy
   tzoah comment.  Old people are easily amused, and even more easily
   distracted.  Also, my tzoah tubes might be backed up.  More fiber will
   help.

   totally cool till they suddenly "go Terrorist." The two Boston brothers
   seemed to blend in with the "Ordinary American" crowd till the bombs
   went off.

   So keeping real "Ordinary Americans" "safe" from terrorists (who were
   formerly "Ordinary Americans") and "safe" from intrusion is the rub. If
   anybody has the "perfect' solution dare to say so. There ain't no such
   thing.

   Saying we should dismantle the entire spying apparatus is arrogant and
   silly. Currently there is no massive terrorist event in the news here,
   but is there another Boston on the horizon? And how would the average
   Bostonian feel about all this? I'd like to see a poll of just that
   city.

     Unaware of Tsarnaev warnings, Boston counterterror unit tracked
     occupy protesters:

     In the fall of 2011, a key Boston police counterterror intelligence
     unit -- funded with millions of dollars in U.S. homeland security
     grants -- was closely monitoring anti-Wall Street demonstrations,
     including tracking the Facebook pages and websites of the protesters
     and writing reports on the potential impact on "commercial and
     financial sector assets" in downtown areas, according to internal
     police documents.

     The police monitoring of the activities of Occupy Boston -- an
     off-shoot of the Occupy Wall Street protests that swept the country
     in 2011 -- came during a period after the U.S. government received
     the second of two warnings from the Russian government about the
     radical Islamic ties of alleged Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan
     Tsarnaev.

       I guess I should have been more specific.
       I was talking about how Republicans immediately started going after
       Holder (because Obama was too popular at the time) right after
       Obama was elected.
       Tea partiers were carrying 'protest' signs claiming Holder was
       going to take away their guns only a few months after Obama was
       elected in 2009.

   he better quit playing the bullshit 'more border security is necessary'
   game on Immigration Reform or he can kiss his senate seat goodbye in
   2016. Illinois isn't Alabama.

     Kirk Votes Against Debate On Senate Immigration Reform Bill:

     Some Republicans are calling for even more stringent border security
     provisions. Kirk, for example, says he would like to see the more
     aggressive border security provisions outlined in an amendment by
     U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) included in the bill before he could
     sign on to the legislation.

     "I've always said border security first, and I actually mean that
     procedurally," Kirk told Politico following the vote. "If [the]
     Cornyn [amendment] can pass, then that opens the door for me."

     Cornyn's amendment, among other things, calls for four "triggers" to
     be met before permanent residency is granted to legalized
     immigrants.

     [505]http://progressillinois.com/...

   If you're from Illinois, e-mail Kirk and tell him to quit playing
   childish games with Immigration Reform.

       I sleep in a loft above my work shop, and what works for me is a
       sprinkler on the roof (it's a compostion shingle roof) .
       Turning the sprinkler on for less than a minute a couple 3 times a

     [621]In case budget doesn't pass, state readies for shutdown

     The current impasse largely revolves around tax revenue. Democrats
     want the Legislature to pass a law to get around a state Supreme
     Court ruling that could cost the state millions of dollars in
     estate-tax refunds. They also want to close a couple of tax breaks,
     including one for residential phone service, to raise money.
     Senate Republicans have said they would agree to do so only if
     Democrats pass three controversial bills favored by their caucus,
     including a measure that would give workers at least 40 years old
     the option of settling workers' compensation claims through
     structured settlements. They say that would save businesses millions
     in future workers' compensation costs.
     House Democrats oppose the Senate bills.

       You can't imagine how many names I screw up and then they stick.
       Actually, Zora isn't mine -- she's one of the local diners that
       come to feed at the trough my landlord sets out.  I just like to
       name the cats that come by.  One I named Smudge because of the
       markings on his face.  The landlord thought he was a stray and had
       me take him to the vets for a check up, shots, etc.
       He was fixed and in pretty good health.  We decided he was double

       It's run through [762]Best Friends Animal Sanctuary. They do the
       spaying and vaccination for free, we just have to trap and
       transport them about 60 miles to the clinic and then bring them
       back.
       It's been a really successful program. Once we tell the neighbors
       what we are up to and why we are going to be creeping around their
       yards at night they come up with something to donate. We make sure
       that some money goes to them with every batch.
       It's really satisfying to be able to do this, it gives me a big
       happy.

 NBC's Richard Engel Dons Gas Mask in Turkey ([809]10+ / 0-)

     NBC's Richard Engel Dons Gas Mask During Dramatic Live Report On
     Turkey Protests

     The protests in Istanbul, Turkey escalated on Tuesday, as riot
     police clashed with protestors in Taksim Square. As police fired
     tear gas and used a water cannon, protestors responded with
     fireworks and throwing stones. In the midst of the dramatic chaos,
     NBC's Richard Engel reported live from the scene -- even donning a
     gas mask midway through the interview.

     Engel explained that Taksim Square is generally the "tourist hub" of
     the city, in stark contrast to the images seen today. Flames could
     be seen in the background and the sound of fireworks was audible, as
     MSNBC host Tamron Hall asked whether Engel needed a minute to put on
     his gas mask. Shortly after, Engel took her up on that offer --
     while Hall brought in former State Department Officer Joel Rubin to
     discuss the situation.

     "The United States is almost dependent on Prime Minister Tayyip
     Erdogan," Engel elaborated, his voice muffled by the mask. "He's the
     last reliable, powerful friend that the United States has in this
     part of the region."

 Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings is calling out Issa ([839]14+ / 0-)

          [851]helpImdrowning, [852]mimi, [853]a gilas girl

   .. to stop cherry picking and release full transcript of IRS hearings.

   Issa has a CT that the White house ordered the IRS to target
   "conservative"  and Teaparty groups specifically.
   It's a lie that Elijah Cummings can and will de-bunk by releasing the
   transcripts himself  - since so far Issa refuses to come clean and
   release the full transcripts of the hearings.

   Facts vs "scandal"
   (short commercial - sorry) [EMBED]

     Elijah Cummings - "I've stated that by Friday.  If the chairman
     [Issa] doesn't want to realease them like he promised ..what we will
     do is we will do the redactions and then submit them to the public
     and to the media so that you all can make your own judgments.
     There'snothing I nthose tapes that I am afraid of"

   Elijah Cummings has first hand knowledge from interviews the oversight
   committee has done with workers in the Cincinnati office where 502©4
   applications were processed that leave no doubt Issa's story is
   bullshit

   Darrell Issa has previously quoted very selectively from those
   interviews but has refused to publicly release those interviews

   It turns out that the IRS manager in Cincinnati, a conservative
   republican, has denied  Issa's allegations:

     "I do not believe that the screening of these cases had anything to
     do, other than consistency and identifying  case that needed to have
     futher development"

   When the manger was asked if he was aware of any political motivations
   behind the screenings he said he was not.

   Howard Dean weighs in:

     "Yeah, the interesting thing about this..first of all, Elijah
     Cummings has been a very courageous congressman for a long time.
     He leads with what he thinks  is right, which is a reasonably
     unusual quality in congress these days, and Darrell  Issa is
     basically a fraud.
     I mean Darrell Issa is a propagandist who, instead of doing his job
     for the United States government as he is paid to do. Thinks this is
     all about politics, and it isn't, and he is about to be undressed by
     the ranking member and I think it's great.
     It's about time somebody told the truth in Washington, and Elijah
     Cummings is telling the truth"

   So once again it turns out that Darrell Issa's big smoking gun is just
   another leaky water pistol

   This will always be a tough week for me.  The guy who was my best

   And Mom.  She passed the night before her birthday, the night before
   she was supposed to come home from the hospital.  All she wanted to do
   was see her birdies one last time, and die in her own bed surrounded by
   her books and everything that made her life hers.   She mentioned on
   numerous occasions that her grandmother, her bedstemor, had died the
   night before her birthday.  So with Bedstemor, so with Mom.

       The government is unlike any private company in that it can
       imprison and shoot us. At least since the Magna Carta we've found
       it prudent to put brakes on that power.

 The reason I'm not surprised ([1086]0+ / 0-)
       is because of this other Phil Ochs song that mentions Medgar Evars
       while properly dissing many of the sorts of hypocritical liberals
       who post here. Of course, many of the liberals he's talking about
       fail to catch the drift of this song and think that Ochs is
       complimenting them.

 The Help ([1094]0+ / 0-)

   Saw The Help the other night, fantastic movie! The movie (I don't
   recall) specifying what the date was, but it does cover Evers
   assassination and the impact it might have had on African-Americans in
   Jackson at the time.

   As the event unfolded, I couldn't help but feel a strong urge to
   psychically bridge the gap of time and let them know that the future is
   not a perfect world, but a better one.

   After watching the movie, I conjured how the characters would respond
   to knowing we have a black president. It was a small sensation of
   justice to grossly unjust situations.

   What separates us, divides us, and diminishes the human spirit.

 Medgar Evers' murderer ([1100]4+ / 0-)

     The state twice prosecuted De La Beckwith for murder in 1964, but
     both trials ended with hung juries. The jurors were all male and all
     white. Mississippi had effectively disfranchised black voters since
     1890, and they were thus prevented from serving as jurors, who were
     limited to voters. During the second trial, the former Governor Ross
     Barnett interrupted the trial to shake hands with Beckwith while
     Myrlie Evers, the widow of the activist, was testifying.

     Wikipedia

   In 1994, 31 years after the crime, he was finally convicted and
   sentenced to prison for life.

   Respect, Meteor Blades, for confronting the culture of these a-holes
   where they lived.

       They exhumed his body for a second autopsy which I think helped
       convict Beckwith. The most amazing thing is after close to 30 years
       in the ground he was perfectly preserved  like he just
       died.Absolutely no decomposition.

   probably becasue you're not old enough to remember the "good" old days.

   De La Beckwith's second trial -- which ended, like the first, in a
   mistrial -- was interrupted during Evers's testimony as the state's
   former governor went over to shake hands with the defendant.

   Two all white male juries -- two mistrials.

   Bad as that is, it would be wrong not to point out that, in that time
   and place of White Citizens' Councils and men willing to use their
   guns, some white male or males on each jury was willing to vote guilty.

       I grew up in Alabama in those days. The culture of intimidation was
