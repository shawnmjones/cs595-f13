   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: An F-16 shoots a drone down with missiles, an Israeli military
       official tells CNN
     * The drone went down five nautical miles off the coast of Haifa
     * An Israeli warplane shot down a drone in October 2012 over the
       Negev Desert
     * Hezbollah claimed responsibility for that flight

   Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli air force shot down a drone approaching
   the nation's coast Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces said.

   An Israeli F-16 shot the drone with air-to-air missiles, an Israeli
   military official told CNN. It went down five nautical miles off the
   coast of Haifa, and Israeli naval forces were searching the area while
   an investigation was initiated, the Israeli military said.

   "I view with utmost gravity this attempt to violate our border," Prime
   Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a prepared statement. "We will
   continue to do everything necessary to safeguard the security of
   Israel's citizens."

   CNN Explains: Drones

   Thursday's incident marked the second time an unmanned aircraft had
   been intercepted in Israeli airspace within the past seven months, the
   IDF said.

   In October 2012, Israeli warplanes tracked and eventually shot down a
   drone over the country's northern Negev Desert.

   That drone did not carry any weapons or explosives, Israeli officials
   said at the time. They declined to discuss the drone's route or whether
   it had approached any sensitive facilities.

   Hezbollah claimed responsibility for sending the drone, which Israeli
   officials at the time said appeared to have originated in Lebanon.

   Hezbollah frequently flies drones over Israel, but the military rarely
   bothers to shoot them down, Michah Zenko of the Council on Foreign
   Relations said at the time.

   CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.
