   New Orleans (CNN) -- New Orleans police said they arrested a suspect in
   the Mother's Day shooting that left 19 people wounded this week.

   In a post on its Facebook page, the police department identified the
   man taken into custody as Akein Scott, 19. It did not provide any more
   details on the arrest.

   A SWAT team was used during the arrest Wednesday night in east New
   Orleans, CNN affiliate WDSU reported .

   The shooting, during a festive Mother's Day parade, renewed concerns
   about crime in the city.

   It was the third holiday this year when guns have been fired into
   crowds, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said.

   A [45]January 21 shooting near a Martin Luther King Day parade left
   five wounded. Four people were hurt in a [46]February Mardi Gras
   attack, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported.

   Police identified the teen as a suspect Monday after footage of the
   shooting was released.

   Images of the parade, released by police Monday, show a man standing at
   the outskirts of a packed parade route. A moment later, he charges
   toward the crowd.

   The surveillance camera images show the panicked crowd scrambling for
   cover. The man runs away, leaving people and bicycles scattered on the
   ground behind him.

   A $10,000 reward had been offered in the case.

   CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.
