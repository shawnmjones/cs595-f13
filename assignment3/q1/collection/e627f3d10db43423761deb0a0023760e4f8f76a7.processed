   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [44]Tagging tips - [45]Search For Tags - [46]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   And anybody who says differently is just trying to ruin our chances at
   the midterms.

       it's an outrage that national security is being outsourced to

       Republicans don't care what the cost of the contractors is.
       They don't care about the government saving money; that's a
       campaign slogan.
       Their only goal is to use the government to shovel as much cash
       into the coffers of their corporate sponsors as they can, and
       defense and national security have long been one of their main
       funnels.
       I used to work for one of those corporations.  When I made the
       mistake of pointing out that a system we were selling to the
       government did not work, I was let go.

   I once worked in for a contractor developing data mining software for
   the intelligence community.

   As such, my only concern is that the absolute junk this technology
   produces will do far more harm than good.

   But aside from that . . .

   Why is everyone so concerned about the government having these massive
   databases, but completely ignoring the danger that comes from having
   large corporations holding the same databases?

   People mention spam and robocalls.  Where do you thing the addresses,
   and the targeting, for them comes from?  Does it not bother any of us
   that private corporations hold a record of all our telephonic and
   on-line activity, sell it to the highest bidder, and use it to market
   to us, and perhaps control the information we get from our search
   algorithms?

   And if I'm so concerned about that, what the hell am I doing entering
   this post into the net?

   In Washington, whenever anyone does something wrong, everyone else gets
   punished.

   A better question would be: could the NSA identify and collect personal

   That's why we're in this mess. And the fault lies MOSTLY with
   Republicans. Here's why.

   When W passed the Patriot Act & did the warrantless wiretapping, I and
   many of us on the left, warned the Repukes that they were essentially
   giving these powers to future Democratic presidents as well as W. Their
   response was "Who cares? If you've done nothing wrong, you've got
   nothing to worry about! Freedumb! USA! USA! USA! Neener! Neener!" (or
   something along those lines).

   I think Repukes HONESTLY bought Rove's "permanent Republican majority"
   horse shit & thought there would NEVER be another Democratic POTUS. Now
   they're in a tizzy because Obama is using the powers THEY gave Bush.

   As much as I like Obama, I'm not an apologist. It doesn't make it right
   if Obama is doing it, but let's not forget this all STARTED under Bush
   & the Repukes because they WANTED it.

       When Bush was called on it and faced outrage from those of us on
       the left, all he had to do was be defiant and use such terms as
       "terrorist surveillance program." His side was in lockstep, and he
       didn't lost much net support.
       Obama is trying that with outrageous statements telling us that we
       can't be both 100% secure and 100% free. We're not buying that shit

   happened under his watch.  He owns it.

   I'm not sure how liberal-bashing is going to help you out, but if
   you're asking for our advice, I suggest you start supporting better
   Dems. Support a return to traditional Dem values of protecting our
