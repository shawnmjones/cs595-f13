   By [109]JOSH AULT
   6 News Reporter

   KNOXVILLE (WATE) - An "It's OK to Say Gay" rally is being held in
   Knoxville to protest Senator Stacey Campfield's controversial "Don't
   Say Gay Bill".

   His bill would forbid students and teachers in Kindergarten through
   eighth grades to discuss that some people are gay.

   The rally will be held at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist
   Church Sunday at two in the afternoon.

   "I got a call that said, 'Devon the bill passed,' and then they hung
   up, so initially I was shocked," said Devon Hicks, who is part of the
   "It's OK to Say Gay" campaign. "I was really, really saddened."

   Hicks helped organize Sunday's rally. He was bullied in school because
   many people thought he was gay.

   "I am actually myself am straight, so technically I have a dog in this
   race, and I don't have a dog in this race," said Hicks. "Here I am a
   straight person working for the gay community because they deserve the
   same treatment as anyone else is getting."

   6 News went to the streets to find out what other people thought about
   taking dialogue about sexuality out of school.

   "I think it should be talked about," said Brittany Spears, who has an
   elementary school age child. "I think there are many families that
   people do and don't know that are gay, and that have gay parents. They
   shouldn't feel like they are not allowed to be open about their
   families and talk about it with others."
   "It just projects dark days around the state," said Fred McMillen, who
   was visiting Knoxville from Ohio. "We live in a time where tolerance
   and acceptance is everywhere, and with a bill like this passing it just
   puts Tennessee back."

   Hicks said the rally will not only talk about the "Don't Say Gay Bill,"
   but will also focus on other issues with being gay, like bullying and
   suicides.
