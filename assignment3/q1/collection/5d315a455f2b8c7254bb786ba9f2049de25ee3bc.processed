[22]President Obama to bring family of Newtown victims to D.C. to pressure
senators on gun legislation

   President Barack Obama attends the Sandy Hook interfaith vigil at
   Newtown High School in Newtown, Conn., Sunday, Dec. 16, 2012.
   [29]AP:

     President Barack Obama is bringing 11 relatives of those killed in
     the shooting at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School to
     Washington on Air Force One on Monday so they can personally
     encourage senators to back gun legislation that faces tough
     opposition.

   So, in the face of Republican [30]obstruction of and [31]NRA pushback
   against the most basic (and popular) gun legislation--universal
   background checks--President Obama is putting a human face on his
   policy agenda. Or, as Republicans will surely say, he's giving them yet
   another reason to not do anything about guns.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Saw some of them interviewed on 60 Minutes last night. Really
       heartbreaking to listen to their stories. Congresspeople who vote
       against, or try to block, some kind of commonsense legislation for
       fear of the NRA are seriously callous human beings.

 Universal background checks just make sense ([119]3+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:

       Expanding the current background check system to cover all firearms
       sales would help to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of
       criminals and the mentally ill.
       The current mandatory background checks make sense and do not
       infringe on anyone's rights.  Expanding them to cover nearly all
       firearms sales would work to save lives.
       That's why the vast majority of Americans support it -- around 90%.
        Most gun owners support it.  Most NRA members support it.  Even
       the NRA itself used to support it.
       Keeping such weapons out of the hands of people like James Holmes,
       the alleged Aurora, Colorado theater shooter, just makes sense.
       It's what any cool-headed legislator who is focused on the public
       good would support, in my opinion.

       I would be on board if there was some mechanism to eliminate the
       paper trail for those who pass their background check with criminal
       penalties for those who neglect this duty.
       Of course, those who have as their true goal civilian disarmament
       would never go for such a sensible provision....after all, why
       would you need to keep records on law-abiding citizens?  So you can
       build a registry and eventually confiscate.

 Vector - I really don't understand this - ([142]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [143]Glen The Plumber, [144]twcollier

   please help me.  There is a paper trail for ownership of all kinds of
   things - cars, homes, cable boxes, etc.  We also have 3 branches of
   federal govt, 3 branches of state govt, 3 branches of local govt - I am
   just baffled that people are troubled that govt knows that they own a
   gun.  Am I some kind of nit wit?  Given the separation of powers and
   the multiple layers of govt, what is the real possibility that guns
   will be confiscated by any or all of them?  Are you worried that if you
   beat up your significant other (I'm just reaching for an example - I'm
   sure that you would never harm your significant other) that govt will
   then try to take your gun?  And if you are a criminal, are you supposed
   to have a gun?  I am sincere in my questioning - I just really don't
   understand this.

   I've been coming to DKos since May 2008 and I still don't have a sig

 Registration can and has led to confiscation. ([148]0+ / 0-)
       This isn't a reference to Nazi Germany, but California in the
       1990s.  California passed a gun ban requiring registration of
       specific semi-automatic rifles that would be henceforth illegal to
       buy or sell within the state.  People who had legally owned and
       registered their SKS 'sporter' rifles had the list used to pinpoint
       them when the political climate changed with respect to that
       specific rifle.  I gather something similar happened in New York,
       although I don't have personal knowledge of how that occurred.
       If you want my support for universal background search, it comes
       with the simple price that it be done justly; if no law has been
       broken and the individual applying passes a background check, what
       justifies keeping their private information on file in anticipation
       of a not-very-likely future crime?  I can not think of one, which
       is why I want a dump of all the data after 60 days for those who
       have broken no laws, and criminal penalties for those who violate
       that.
       If this isn't the thin end of the wedge, why not?

 Thanks for your response - ([152]0+ / 0-)
       Is your idea under consideration?  Would it pull in conservative
       Dems and some Republicans? Your idea certainly sounds reasonable
       although one potential problem I see is that a buyer who passes a
       check and has personal info destroyed, then passes his/her gun on
       to a criminal or mentally ill friend or relative - do you think
       there is any way to deal with this potential problem?  It would be
       great if there were an acceptable solution.

       person broke the law and should be prosecuted.

 I see - ([160]0+ / 0-)
       and I certainly hope they can work something out that is impactful
       rather than simply being "window dressing."  With regard to the
       seller breaking the law, I'm not sure how we would know the law had
       been broken until the person to whom the gun was given or sold,
       breaks the law again (the gun receiver would already be a criminal
       because if he/she weren't, there would be no problem) or an episode
       driven by mental illness occured - in which case, action can only
       be taken AFTER a shooting occured rather than keeping the guns away
       from the family/friend criminal or ill person in the first place.
       I would think that transfers could still be registered and then
       follow the same 60-day (or some period) paperwork retention
       limitation that you describe for commercial sales.  Obviously, from
       our discussion here, it is clear that the devil is in the details.

       in that I think the families who have pushed for legislation, been
       vocal, showed pictures of their children blown to bits did so for
       their purpose too. It is incredibly sad to me that they have to
       work this hard to push legislatures to pass common sense laws, but
       they are doing it for their children and America's children. Surely
       their love for their deceased children know no limits and at least,
       not yet, are they ready to withdraw. Let them show who and what the
       NRA is, this too, I believe, is a part of their grieving process.
       As a country we should be grieving with them, instead we are
       beholden to the weight of a lobbyist group - the NRA, and it is
       sickening. These parents are burdened, perhaps their push in
       passing legislation will relieve some of their burden.

       want to use their personal tragedy to reduce gun violence in this

       membership in the NRA when it became obvious that it was little

       However, I must point out that the NRA does NOT support "automatic
       weapons"; automatic weapons were outlawed in the U.S. in the 1930's
       and are not available except to the military, some police forces,
       and a very few collectors who operate under severe restrictions and
       at great expense.  Just straightening out a error that one often
       encounters.  Did you mean "semi-automatic" weapons?  If so, this
       is a type of firearm action has been around since the late 1800's
       and poses no greater a threat now than back then.

       we perhaps will tolerate the antique ones more because they tend to
       be less effective than fancy new stuff, particularly the high
       capacity weapons, but I would imagine there's a few million dead
       people that will tell you that guns have done a lot of damage for a
       very, very long time.
       That's why we want universal background checks. Not just background
       checks for rambo-esque crap. And that's why anyone who's paying
       attention to the bigger issues knows that a gradual reduction in
       armaments of all types must be a goal. There are many ways to
       accomplish this, some of which would be straightforward and still
       allow some enthusiasts their playtime, but due to NRA obstruction
       we appear to be headed for what may be the most effective solution
       - a labyrinth of state laws that will make owning a gun an exercise
       in comedy.

       and avoid misconceptions:  'automatic weapons' have not been
       available to the public in this country for purchase for over a
       half century.  There has NEVER been an informed discussion about
       whether citizens can or should have automatic weapons.  The NRA is
       a bunch of assholes but even THEY do not support citizens having
       'automatic weapons.'  Please, for God's sake, get your terminology
       straight.  If you are talking about 'semi-automatic' weapons,
       please say so.  And by the way, 'semi-automatic' weapons have been
       available for purchase by the general public since the late 1800's.
       Semi-automatic weapons make up the vast majority of handguns,
       rifles, and shotguns used by hunters and shooting enthusiasts in
       America and have held that popularity for many, many, many decades.

   This morning on NPR, Publicans think the bestest newest way to frame
   the issue is to re-write the second amendment so it reads the way the
   framers meant it:

   To protect us from the tyranny of government, the right to bear arms
   shall not be infringed.

   See, the Revolution was about taking up arms against the tyranny of
   King George.

   So if the "guvmint" tries to take your guns away, the nice man in the
   suit that comes to your door to do so may be shot.

   If the government wanted your guns, they would take them and if you try
   to stop a tank with your Bushmaster you are going to lose that
   gunfight.

   The fact that you can't own military weapons ALREADY means your right
   to bear arms has been effectively and irrevocably infringed.

       would take more seriously who they vote for when they have the
       prospect of voting for these bat shit crazy loons like
       Cruz,Paul,and Ricky Ricardo Rubio when the opportunity comes.Just
       having an "R" after their name shouldn't be their only
       criteria.Just embarasses their state in front of the rest of the
       country.

 Until The NRA Bought And Paid For Legislators ([544]6+ / 0-)

   are defeated - in other words, until the American public sends a
   message to the NRA and the gun manufacturers loud and clear - sensible
   gun control laws are going to continue to be stonewalled. The NRA and
   the gun manufacturers DON'T GIVE A DAMN about murdered children, all
   they care about is profits and fearmongering about "second amendment
   rights" to a sector of the population that is ignorant, racist, and
   hates the government. Let's try and get universal background checks
   passed, and get the names of every legislator who votes against
   background checks for primary season.

   And where is Michelle on this?  Over weight kids is one thing, but
   murdered and terrorized kids is quite another.

   If Obama is really serious about gun [DEL: control :DEL] safety, he
   should be putting himself and the first spouse out there big time.

   There are so many ways, as with gun control, that he could be helping.

   I just don't get why he is intent on hacking at the New Deal.

   What's the point of letting neoliberals into the tent when
   neoliberalism is burning down the campground?
   Since elections will never change the ownership of government, why does
   our strategy rely entirely upon them?

   how those wingnuts like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz can look at the families

   gun control at all.If they do they are heartless cold blooded
