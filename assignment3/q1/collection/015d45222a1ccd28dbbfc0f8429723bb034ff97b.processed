[22]'That's Vice President Joe Biden'

   U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (R) poses with a military veteran during
   the Philadelphia Phillies versus Washington Nationals baseball game in
   Washington July 31, 2012. &nbsp;REUTERS/Gary Cameron &nbsp; (UNITED
   STATES - Tags: SPORT BASEBALL POLITICS MILITARY)
   At the risk of being a little cheesy, I loved this story from GQ's
   [29]profile of Joe Biden:

     "I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds here," says John [Vice
     President Biden's senior Secret Service agent], in the front seat.
     It's the first time he's stepped in like this. It feels like a
     rescue, a guy taking a bullet. Lay off my boss. "Quick little story.
     We stopped at Dunkin' Donuts. A man comes up. 'Joe, you gotta come
     see my wife, she's really ill.' A small little house there. Hospital
     bed in the living room, her deathbed. No air-conditioning. And the
     vice president told a staff person, 'Hey, let's make sure we get an
     A/C unit here.' I was like, wow. That's Vice President Joe Biden."

     "That's nice of you to say, Johnny," Biden says to him, even though
     the story is sort of off-topic. "And by the way, we bought her some
     doughnuts."

   Nothing really deep or profound to say, but that's a great story, and
   every so often it's nice to see the human side of these guys.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [40]Tagging tips - [41]Search For Tags - [42]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [43]Civil
   Rights, [44]Community, [45]Congress, [46]Culture, [47]Economy,
   [48]Education, [49]Elections, [50]Energy, [51]Environment, [52]Health
   Care, [53]International, [54]Labor, [55]Law, [56]Media, [57]Meta,
   [58]National Security, [59]Science, [60]Transportation, or [61]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([62]California, [63]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       You pay attention to people. Because if you don't, everybody will

       Delaware is a very small place. With a really long memory, and a
       bunch of people who have been here for a long time. They might not
       have been born here, but the place is sticky. You land here for a

   I really like EDD - Empathy Deficit Disorder.  Maybe we can have it
   added to the next DSM -  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders.

   Of course, EDS - Empathy Deficit Syndrome might be more appropriate
   because Disorders are usually believed to be caused by metabolic
   deficiencies and Syndromes describe behavior patterns not believed to
   be metabolically based.

   The are  descriptions are simplified.

 Does Not Do Well Against Christie ([759]0+ / 0-)

   I love Joe. But the polls I've seen where he's matched up against
   Christie do not look good, Ohio being one of them.

   But, I also doubt that Christie is going to get the Repub nomination.

       I think Joe can seem like the adult compared to Christie's petulant
       child routine. Unless in addition to bariatric surgery Christie has
       undergone anger  management training he will have problems playing
       in the big league.

   Some of the stories about things he does for/to his wife on Valentine's
   day are really sweet.

   Biden understands that, at it's root, politics is not about debate,
   philosophy, grand ideals, or economic numbers.  It's about making
   things work for people.

   If people are doing OK, politicians are doing a good job.
   If people are doing badly, not so much.

 Great guy. Horrid lawmaker. ([905]0+ / 0-)

   When you look at his record of a lawmaker, he is horrible from a
   progressive point of view.  He voted for and defended Bush's horrid
   bankrupcy bill, he passed through Bush's declaration of war against
   Iraq, voted for DOMA, voted for the absolutely vicious welfare reform
   bill, voted for the Communications Act consolidating media, voted for
   NAFTA, and voted for the repeal of Glass Steigal.  His foreign policy
   is nothing short of jingoism literally calling for a new cold war
   against Russia when Georgia attached them.

   But he is good soldier for sure.  I remember a post here showing just
   an absolutely rip-roaring speech he gave to the Teamsters.  Great
   speech.  A month later the Obama administration backstabbed the
   Teamsters by allowing Mexican trucks full open access to American
   highways.

 Another Biden Story ([909]0+ / 0-)

   My daughter and son in law met Biden when he sang as part of the
   Christmas in Washington celebration. My daughter asked for ideas on
   what to mention if she met Biden or Obama. She spent some time with
   Biden and shared that her 87 year old grandmother had worked for a year
   registering voters, helping them get absentee ballots, and driving
   people to the polls in FL. He asked for Laura's cell phone and called
   my mother to thank her for helping Barack and him get elected in FL.
   When she didn't believe it was really Biden, he took a picture with my
   daughter and texted it to my mother. WOW, he did not have to do any of
   this. But he sure made that 87 year old's day.
