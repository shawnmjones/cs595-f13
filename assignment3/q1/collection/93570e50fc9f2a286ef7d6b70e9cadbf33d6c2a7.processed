Mississippi anti-abortion bill 'obviously unconstitutional'

   Mississippi State Senator Hob Bryan

   All session, Mississippi Republicans have been working a pair of
   conservative bills that would almost surely give them trouble in the
   courts. With time running out, and with concerns about future court
   challenges, [3]Mississippi Republicans have handed those bills over to
   the minority Democrats for a final say.

   One bill is an [4]anti-immigration measure styled after the [5]law in
   Alabama, which was in turn styled after the [6]law in Arizona, and
   which has given both states fits since they passed them. State Senator
   Hob Bryan, the Mississippi Democrat whose committee is considering the
   bill, tells the [7]Jackson Clarion-Ledger it could interfere with the
   way police officers and sheriffs do their jobs. That might be manners
   for "no way."

   The second bill is one that Mississippi Republicans have hoped would
   essentially [8]ban all abortions. State Senator Bryan says it doesn't
   make sense to pass a measure that goes against Roe v. Wade. He says
   state lawmakers have taken plenty of votes already against abortion:

     What we have not done is to pass bill after bill after bill that was
     obviously unconstitutional just so we could all get on record one
     more time as casting another vote realizing that what was going to
     happen was someone would file suit the next day and the legislation
     would never take effect.

   Both bills must pass today, starting with Bryan's judiciary committee,
   or be gone. [9]UPDATE: Bryan left both bills off the schedule today, so
   they're toast.

   (P.S. If anyone feels up to the challenge of diagramming Sen. Bryan's
   one-sentence quote, [10]please send the results here.)

   Dear State Senator Hob Bryan, you do realize that with the irrational
   tea-pottyers/religuluous zealots that have taken over the GOP - you
   will be primary-ied(?), due to your wanting to inject "common sense"
   into this discussion, don't you?!

   Except that he's a Dem, so the TPers can't really primary him.

   Apparently they do exist in Mississippi...

   I do believe the push has been on to get a law passed that would
   eventually end up at the supreme court. This Supreme Court in
   particular.

   Indeed. If there's any SC in recent years that's more likely to
   overturn Roe v Wade purely on political grounds it would be this one.

   My brain hurts from trying to diagram that sentence. English teachers
   everywhere are feeling the tremors of bad sentence structure.

   Yes, and this is exactly why they keep saying "Government is
   inefficient and wasting tax payer money...."

   Or.....maybe they just do it as a test to see if we still actually
   uphold the constitution (just like dressing up as a prostitute to get
   ACORN or doing voter fraud to prove there is voter fraud, etc, etc)?

   Once you take out the extraneous stuff, it boils down to 'we didn't
   pass any bills people would sue us over.' Wow, way to set some high
   standards there, sir.

   I think Politicians should stop worrying about American History In
   Collage and maybe worry more about American English Composition in
   Schools.(Apparently ALL of them:)

   That sentence is even too much for the Reed-Kellog sentence diagrammer
   software. I tried it in that program. No results popped up but the
   program did tell me that they "found no utterance." in that sentence.
   LMAO, even a computer program won't touch that sentence with a ten foot
   pole.

   I think he did not want to tell the GOP Tea-party plainly that they
   were loosing one constituency after another by concentrating one one
   non-issue since he wants them on that path till November!

   I was not aware that Mississippi was financially well off to afford
   protracted litigation that the state will lose in the federal courts.

   [ ] = words that were moved, but still are part of Mr. Bryan's original
   sentence.

   There, all better, the new improved sentence:

   "What we have done is pass bill after bill that was obviously
   unconstitutional just so we could all get on record as casting another
   vote on legislation that would never take affect." Mississippi State
   Senator Bryan

   Too bad Lincoln could not stop slavery and still let them secede.

   Perhaps the legislature of the State of Mississippi could statutorily
   overturn Roe v. Wade privacy rights if only it could get a Commerce
   Clause like the U.S. Congress. If so, then it could assert that it also
   has the constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce (similar
   to what is claimed by Congress for allowing it to require individuals
   to purchase health care insurance from private insurers) by simply
   passing an individual mandate prohibiting the use of birth control and
   requiring that all pregnant women must carry their fetus to term. Such
   compulsive mandates over an individual's reproductive privacy rights
   could be justified by the tangible and substantial affect on interstate
   commerce that would reasonably be expected due to an anticipated
   increased birth rate leading to an increase of the labor force. A
   compelling state purpose sufficient to override any competing
   fundamental privacy rights concerning reproduction that may have been
   articulated in Roe v. Wade could be empirically demonstrated by the
   legislature by showing how this would address a rational economic need
   for increasing the proportion of younger citizens required to be
   consumers and taxpayers to better help support an increasingly,
   demographically older population.

   Although the above hypothetical was intended to be a somewhat facetious
   example of potential dangers of vastly expanding Congress' powers to
   enact individual mandates, it might not be as farfetched as I initially
   thought since there are some Republican candidates currently seeking
   that Party's nomination to run for President that seem to be openly
   calling for the passage of such laws.
