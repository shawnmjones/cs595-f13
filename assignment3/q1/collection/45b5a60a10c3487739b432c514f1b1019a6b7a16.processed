Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson SUVs do poorly in crash test

   Small SUVs struggle in crash test
   NEW YORK (CNNMoney)

Several popular compact SUVs did poorly in a tough new crash test conducted
by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. However, two, the new Subaru
Forester and the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, did well.

   The Hyundai ([21]HYMTF) Tucson[22], Ford Escape, Kia Sportage, General
   Motors ([23]GM, [24]Fortune 500)'[25] Buick Encore and the Chrysler
   Group's Jeep Patriot earned "poor" marks in the new[26] "small overlap"
   frontal crash test. In this test, the vehicle hits a barrier at 40
   miles per hour with just one-quarter of its front bumper. The impact
   occurs on the left side, just in front of the driver's seat. This
   concentrates crash forces in a small area that's outside of the strong
   crash safety structures built into most new vehicles.

   About a quarter of the serious and fatal injuries in front crashes are
   caused by "small overlap" impacts similar to this, according to the
   Institute. These crashes can also cause severe foot and leg injuries as
   the car's front wheel is pushed back into the passenger compartment.
   Real small overlap crashes often happen when vehicles leave the road
   and hit trees or utility poles.

   The small overlap test is just one of several crash tests performed by
   the Institute. Most vehicles already do well in the other crash tests.
   In defense of their vehicles' overall safety, Chrysler, General Motors
   ([27]GM, [28]Fortune 500) and other manufacturers pointed out that
   their SUVs earned the Institute's Top Safety Pick award.

   "Ford takes seriously every industry development related to vehicle
   crash performance," Ford Motor Co. ([29]F, [30]Fortune 500) said in a
   statement. "This is the first time IIHS has conducted this type of test
   on small SUVs. We are reviewing its findings in the context of our
   current design evaluations."

   Among the vehicles that performed well, besides being Top Safety Picks,
   the Subaru ([32]FUJHF) Forester and Mitsubishi ([33]MHVYF) Outlander
   Sport also earned the new Top Safety Pick "Plus" award. That award
   means they performed well in all tests, including the small overlap
   test. The Subaru and the Mitsubishi earned ratings of "good" and
   "acceptable," respectively, in the small overlap test.

   "With the redesigned Forester, Subaru's engineers set out to do well in
   our new test, and they succeeded," says Joe Nolan, the Institute's vice
   president for vehicle research. "This is exactly how we hoped
   manufacturers would respond to improve protection for people in these
   kinds of serious frontal crashes."

   The BMW X1, Nissan ([34]NSANF) Rogue, Mazda CX-5, Honda CR-V,
   Volkswagen ([35]VLKAF) Tiguan and Jeep Wrangler earned the rating of
   "marginal" in the overall small overlap test. But when breaking down
   the test results down into more specific units, such as the crash
   protection provided by a vehicle's body and how well the crash test
   dummy's movements were controlled, the Institute pointed out the Rogue
   as an example of poor structural protection. After the crash test, the
   Rogue's door frame was almost touching the driver's seat, the Institute
   said.

   Nissan pointed out that the Rogue was, overall, one of the better
   performers in this new test.

   "Nissan will continue to review these and other results from the IIHS
   'small overlap front test' as we seek opportunities for improvement,"
   the carmaker said in a statement.

   Small overlap crashes are dangerous, in part, because the vehicle spins
   violently after impact, causing an occupant to move sideways, away from
   areas that are protected by airbags. Also, the vehicle itself can be
   contorted so that airbags end up not being in the proper locations to
   protect passengers. For instance, in the Jeep Patriot, the steering
   wheel moved up and to the right allowing the crash test dummy's head to
   slide off the airbag. [36]To top of page
