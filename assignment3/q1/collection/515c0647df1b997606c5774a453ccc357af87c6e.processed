'CAPTURED!!!' Boston police announce Marathon bombing suspect in custody

   By Chelsea J. Carter and Greg Botelho , CNN
   updated 11:59 PM EDT, Fri April 19, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: 58 people remain hospitalized from Monday's bombings,
       according to a CNN tally
     * "CAPTURED!!! The hunt is over" police tweet after second suspect is
       in custody

   (CNN) -- The second suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings was taken
   into custody Friday night, bringing to an end a massive manhunt in the
   tense Massachusetts capital worried by warnings the man was possibly
   armed with explosives.

   After announcing the arrest on Twitter, Boston police tweeted:
   "CAPTURED!!! The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over.
   And justice has won. Suspect in custody."

   Authorities confirmed the man in custody is 19-year-old Dzhokar
   Tsarnaev, who escaped an overnight shootout with police that left his
   older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- the other man wanted in the bombings
   -- dead.

   The younger Tsarnaev was in serious condition, Boston Police
   Commissioner Ed Davis said at a news conference. He was being treated
   at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman
   Kelly Lawman said.

   Tsarnaev was cornered late Friday as he was hiding on a boat in a
   backyard of Watertown, a suburb of Boston.

   Police were alerted to his whereabouts by a man who went outside after
   authorities lifted an order for residents to stay inside during the
   manhunt. The resident saw blood on a boat in the backyard, Davis said.
   He then lifted up the tarp covering the boat and "saw a man covered
   with blood," he said.

   It was that call that resulted in an arrest less than a week after two
   bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, shocking
   the nation and leaving a city on edge.

   "There was an exchange of gunfire, and I don't know if he was struck,"
   Davis said of the suspect.

   Authorities, using a bullhorn, had called on the suspect to surrender:
   "Come out with your hands up."

   Tsarnaev, according to authorities, refused to surrender.

   "We used a robot to pull the tarp off the boat," David Procopio of the
   Massachusetts State Police said. "We were also watching him with a
   thermal imaging camera in our helicopter. He was weakened by blood loss
   -- injured last night most likely,"

   Tsarnaev was taken into custody after authorities rushed the boat,
   Davis said.

   Closing a chapter

   The standoff and subsequent arrest came just minutes after authorities
   indicated during a news conference that a manhunt for the suspect
   appeared to come up empty.

   Authorities had cast a wide net for the suspect, virtually shutting
   down Boston and its surroundings after a violent night in which
   authorities say the brothers allegedly hurled explosives at pursuers,
   after killing Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean
   Collier and hijacking a car.

   "We've closed an important chapter in this tragedy," President Barack
   Obama said in a televised address. Even so, he vowed to seek answers to
   the motive in the attack and find out whether the suspects received any
   help to carry out their plot.

   The government is invoking the public safety exception to question
   Tsarnaev, meaning in cases of national security a person can be
   questioned without being read their Miranda rights, a Justice
   Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity. The official is
   not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.

   U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz told reporters the "government has that
   opportunity right now" to invoke the public safety exemption but
   stopped short of declaring it would take that step, saying only the
   suspect was in the hospital.

   Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham called for Tsarnaev
   to be held as an enemy combatant.

   'Glad it's over'
   Officer: We are so grateful to be here
   Uncle to 'loser': Turn yourself in
   Witness: We heard explosions, gunshots
   Deadly shooting at MIT

   Word of the arrest spread quickly in suburban Watertown, where
   residents took to the streets to cheer the news that suspect had been
   arrested.

   "Thank you. Thank you. It was our pleasure," members of the Boston SWAT
   team said over a loudspeaker.

   Mary Sullivan was walking her black Labrador earlier Friday night when
   gunshots rang out in her neighborhood.

   "I'm glad it's over," she said. "The city and the people have gone
   through so much pain over these irrational decisions of these young
   men."

   Bombing connection

   The manhunt began late Thursday just hours after the FBI released
   photos of the two suspects in the marathon bombings.

   "Investigators are recovering a significant amount of homemade
   explosives" from the scene of the shootout, Procopio told CNN.

   It was not immediately clear what explosives were recovered, but the
   discovery followed a tense night in which authorities say the brothers
   allegedly hurled a homemade grenade and five pipe bombs at pursuers
   after killing an officer and hijacking a car.

   Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was wearing explosives and a triggering device
   when he died, a source briefed on the investigation told CNN on
   condition of anonymity.

   The manhunt brought Boston to a near standstill. The Boston Red Sox
   announced they were postponing Friday night's game against the Kansas
   City Royals "to support efforts of law enforcement officers." NHL's
   Boston Bruins also postponed its game against the Pittsburgh Penguins.

   The city's subway, bus, Amtrak train and Greyhound and regional Bolt
   Bus services were shut down. Taxi service across the city also was
   suspended for a time during the manhunt. Every Boston area school was
   closed.

   Boston's public transit authority sent city buses to Watertown to
   evacuate residents while bomb experts combed the surroundings for
   possible explosives.

   Initially, authorities said the brothers started their rampage by
   robbing a convenience store. By late Friday, the Middlesex District
   Attorney's office backtracked on the allegation, saying an
   investigation determined that the robbery at a 7-Eleven was unrelated.

   Officer killed

   The violent hours leading up to the capture began in Cambridge, across
   the Charles River from Boston, MIT officer Collier was shot and killed
   while he sat in his car on Thursday night, the Suffolk County District
   Attorney's Office said in a statement.

   The two suspects, according to authorities, then hijacked a vehicle at
   gunpoint in Cambridge, telling the driver that they were the marathon
   bombers, a law enforcement source told CNN.

   At some point, apparently at a gas station, that source said, the
   driver escaped.

   Police, who were tracking the vehicle using its built-in GPS system,
   picked up the chase in Watertown. The pursuit went into a residential
   neighborhood, with the suspects throwing explosives at police.

   A shootout erupted and ultimately one bomber -- later identified as
   Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- got out of the car. Police shot him, and his
   brother ran over him as he drove away, according to the law enforcement
   source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Richard H. Donohue Jr., 33, a three-year veteran of the transit system
   police force, was shot and wounded in the incident and taken to a
   hospital, a transit police spokesman said Friday. The officer's
   condition was not immediately known.

   Another 15 police officers were treated for minor injuries sustained
   during the explosions and shootout, Jennifer Kovalich, a spokeswoman
   for St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, said.

   Suspects background

   Police believe the brothers are the same men pictured in images
   released Thursday by the FBI as suspects in the marathon bombing that
   killed three people and wounded dozens on Monday.

   At least 58 people remained hospitalized, including three in critical
   condition, according to a CNN count.

   The men are shown in the images walking together near the marathon
   finish line.

   The first suspect -- apparently Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to
   authorities -- appears in the images wearing a dark hat, sunglasses and
   a backpack. The second suspect, wearing a white cap, police said, is
   the one who remained at large throughout Friday until he was taken into
   custody Friday night.

   But the mother of the Tsarnaev brothers refused to believe they were
   involved in the marathon bombings and subsequent shootout.

   "It's impossible for them to do such things. I am really telling you
   that this is a setup," Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told state-run Russia Today
   from Dagestan.

   "My son would never keep it in secret. ...If there is anyone who would
   know it would be me. He wouldn't hide it. But there was never a word."

   The brothers came from the Russian Caucasus region and moved to
   Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States several
   years ago.

   "My youngest was raised from 8 years in America. My oldest was really
   properly raised in our house. Nobody talked about terrorism," their
   mother said.

   The suspects' parents recently returned to Dagestan in the Caucasus
   region after living in the United States for about 10 years because
   they were "nostalgic," the father, Anzor Tsarnaev, told Russian
   state-run Zvezda TV.

   He accused someone of framing his sons. "I don't know who exactly did
   it. But someone did."

   A federal official told CNN that Dzhokar Tsarnaev came to the U.S. as a
   tourist with his family in the early 2000s and later asked for asylum.
   He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2012. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was not
   a naturalized citizen, said the official, who spoke on condition of
   anonymity. He came "a few years later" and was lawfully in the United
   States as a green-card holder.

   Tamerlan Tsarnaev had studied at Bunker Hill Community College and
   wanted to become an engineer, according to those who knew him. He then
   took a year off to train as a boxer.

   'I don't understand them'

   The official said that a posting on a social media site in the elder
   brother's name included the comments: "I don't have a single American
   friend. I don't understand them."

   Dzhokar Tsarnaev attended Cambridge Rindge & Latin, a public high
   school, said Eric Mercado, who graduated a year behind the suspect.
   Mercado said Tsarnaev had worked at Harvard University as a lifeguard.

   "We hung out; we partied; we were good high school friends," Mercado
   told CNN.

   "We're all, like, in shock. We don't really understand. There were no
   telltale signs of any kind of malicious behavior from Dzhokar. It's all
   coming as a shock, really."

   Mercado said he lived a block away from the suspect and did not know
   his older brother.

   Dzhokar Tsarnaev is currently registered as a student at University of
   Massachusetts Dartmouth, which ordered its campus evacuated on Friday.
   The school is located 65 miles south of Cambridge, just west of New
   Bedford.

   Larry Aaronson, Dzhokar Tsarnaev's neighbor and a former teacher at the
   high school Tsarnaev attended, called him a "wonderful kid."

   "He was so grateful to be here, he was compassionate, he was caring, he
   was jovial," Aaronson told CNN.

   CNN's Carol Cratty, Susan Candiotti, Michael Pearson, John King, Joe
   Johns, Chris Lawrence, Deborah Feyerick, Ben Brumfield, Jake Tapper and
   Drew Griffin contributed to this report.
