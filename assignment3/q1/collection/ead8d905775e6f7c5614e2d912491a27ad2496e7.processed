[22]Why Louie Gohmert continues to be America's Dumbest Congressman

   Representative Louie Gohmert (R-TX) questions U.S. Attorney General
   Eric Holder during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on
   Regular readers will know that I cannot stand Rep. Louie Gohmert, due
   in very large part to me once having to be in the same room with him
   while he attempted a series of complete sentences, a task which he
   muddled through with varying degrees of success and coherent thoughts
   (an onstage rhetorical abortion, and I will note here for the record
   that the conference planners pointedly did not have admitting
   privileges to any local hospitals, an oversight which I believe needs
   to be corrected if they are ever to subject a roomful of people to
   Louie Gohmert ever again in their conference-having lives). There are
   certainly other congressthings that are more evil (Ted Cruz, Steve
   King) and very, very many who are simply just batshit insane and then
   some (looking at you, Steve Stockman), but none of them quite manage
   the eats paste with a knife and fork genre that Gohmert has mastered.
   During any given one of Louie Gohmert's proclamations, it is remarkable
   indeed to gain any insight as to what Louie Gohmert is actually trying
   to say about the subject in question. It could be a conspiracy
   theory--but no, it is too poorly described to really be described as
   such. It could be an attempt at humor, perhaps? No, nobody here is
   laughing, not even the true believers who think shooting range targets
   modeled after famous Democrats are the most hi-larious things ever.

   Whatever it is, Louie Gohmert manages to hit some excruciating but
   inaudible pitch that apparently only my ears can hear, because if there
   is one member of Congress that I think really ought to be packed into a
   suitcase and sent back to whatever American wasteland foisted him upon
   us, it would be him. Bachmann I can stomach. Allen West was a walk in
   the park. I could even learn to live with the smarmy, thick-headed
   cruelty of a Ted Cruz; if we are going to have yet another McCarthyite
   in the Senate, we might as well choose the one who is gobsmackingly
   terrible at it. But please, East Texas, if you're going to send
   paintlickers like this to higher office then message received: We'll
   let you secede already. We'll let you secede and give you a lifetime
   supply for [29]all the paint you can huff.

     A Republican congressman from Texas said Monday that President
     Barack Obama's decision to close 22 U.S. embassies and consulates
     because of credible terrorist threats makes the country look "like a
     bunch of cowards."

   More on Louie below the fold.

   All you have to do is imagine what Louie Gohmert would say if the
   embassies had not closed; it would have been the exact opposite, and no
   prizes for guessing how many separate investigations Louie Gohmert
   would personally demand in front of how many town halls if anything,
   anywhere had actually happened to one of them. The answer is
   eleventy-two, with a remainder of banana. He would have said that
   leaving the embassies open in the face of a "credible threat" was a
   sign the administration was needlessly putting lives in danger to prove
   their political machismo, except he would have said it far more
   stupidly, and he would have demanded that someone think of all the
   troops and diplomats that were risking their lives when thuh
   Administration knew they were in danger. We know this because Louie
   Gohmert is part of the Benghazi! rhetorical brigades, or at least he
   would be if he wasn't already floating face-up in a pool of what he
   considers wisdom:

     "If you will bother to find out exactly what went wrong, why you
     didn't have security where you needed it, where you need security to
     shore up, what you can do to make sure that doesn't happen again,
     you don't have to close your embassies like a bunch of cowards that
     go running away," Gohmert said.

   Well there you go--a true master of the deep thought, that one. All you
   have to do is provide security that Louie Gohmert and company demanded
   we stop paying for because Freedum, and then double and triple that
   security while Louie Gohmert demands we not pay for that either because
   Libertee, and then Louie Gohmert will be quite solidly behind the
   notion of people who are not him risking their lives to show that
   America isn't "a bunch of cowards." From the comfort of the Sean
   Hannity studios, of course, because everyone knows true bravery is
   sitting behind a microphone and explaining why other Americans need to
   get shot at. It's been a staple of America's bravest voices since,
   hell, since the microphone was invented.

     Gohmert drew parallels to the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis,
     characterizing then-President Jimmy Carter's negotiations and rescue
     attempt as inadequate. Gohmert described the failed rescue, which
     killed eight U.S. servicemen and one Iranian civilian, as, "Please,
     please, will you please give us our people back."

   I would characterize it more like any one of the many, many embassy and
   barracks attacks which have pockmarked the last few decades, none of
   which Louie Gohmert gives a shit about or even remembers because the
   last incident of terrorism or international violence that he can recall
   is Benghazi, and the only one before that was at the end of the Carter
   administration, and absolutely no lessons from any other event or
   decade from 1979 until now have any role to play in what Louie Gohmert
   thinks about things. Nope. It goes 1979 hostage crisis, Benghazi,
   today. Can't think of anything else that might have happened. (Also
   fascinating: Jimmy Carter sending an ultimately unsuccessful team of
   special forces to forcibly extract American hostages over the dead
   bodies of their captors continues to be characterized as "please, will
   you please give us our people back," while Ronald Reagan and associates
   breaking any number of laws to and congressional edicts to give that
   same foreign government weapons while saying "please, will you please
   give us our people back" is the most butt-hurtingly awesome act of
   toughness and resolve that all of Republicanism has been able to muster
   for three-plus decades, and if there is a psychologist out there who
   has been able to piece together how that little bit of schizophrenia
   managed to implant itself so firmly in the conservative brain, give me
   a call, I've got a few fine ideas on what you can name the syndrome.)

   The only thing that can possibly be worse than listening to the grating
   sound of a stupid person trying to sound thoughtful is listening to a
   stupid person explain why various large sets of not-him people need to
   go get themselves bombed or shot at or otherwise ground into a fine
   paste in order to demonstrate how politically brave and manly the
   stupid person believes himself to be. This is a market niche that has
   already been filled to the point of absolute glut; we do not need yet
   another voice on the subject. I do not know what Louie Gohmert does
   well or if there is any subcategory of thought anywhere on the planet
   that truly needs Louie Gohmert to contribute to it--surely, there are
   used cars on an East Texas lot somewhere that still need selling--but
   on the subject of what other, far more professional people should be
   doing with their lives so as to not be perceived as "a bunch of
   cowards," good God. I'm beginning to think that the mere act of handing
   Louie Gohmert a microphone should be treated as something close to a
   war crime.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       if you know her or her staff, you might want to let them know the

       Does she realistically stand a chance?  I would love to see Gohmert

 Gohmert had never been challenged. ([234]14+ / 0-)

       Gogmert took the seat in 2004 with Bush atop the ballot. The first
       challenger quit after getting on the ballot, both as a Democrat in
       2006 and as an independent in 2008. The only challenger in 2010 was
       a Libertarian. Shirley even made some tactical decisions last year
       which, in my opinion, hurt her chances that year. She is taking a
       different approach this cycle.
       You need someone willing to fight the fight and Shirley has shown
       that willingness and I believe she is correcting the strategic
       errors she made in 2012.
       Gohmert has never been challenged and a true challenge on the
       Republicans at the top of the ticket and conservatism in general
       could swing this race. I don't see Cornyn, Abbott, or Dewhurst
       bringing out the Tea Party or Republican base.
       Without Bush, Perry, or a Presidential race on the ticket, Gohmert
       has to try and win on his own this year.
       Gohmert doesn't have any money to mount a defense or a challenge to
       a supported challenger.
       A true challenge to Gohmert will take much fewer resources than are
       spent in other districts.
       There is a lot of animosity nationwide towards Gohmert nationwide
       and if they come up with support against Gohmert he can be beat.

       that none of these people's websites ever mention their political
       party?  Is it just a given that to be running for office in East
       Texas a candidate is a conservative?  At least this woman doesn't
       present herself the complete moron as Gohmert has proved himself to
       be.  Baby steps.

       My guess in many cases is that there is a perception by some that
       the Democratic label is toxic.  We have a lot of local Democratic
       officials that have switched parties in the last 4 years in East
       Texas.  They haven't really changed there views -- local offices
       have a very different dynamic than state or dynamic offices usually

     Louie Gohmert Says He Once Duct-Taped Defendant's Head While Serving
     As Judge (VIDEO)

     Before he began railing against the Muslim Brotherhood and his
     "numbnuts" colleagues on Capitol Hill, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas)
     served as a district judge for Texas' Smith County, where he once
     deployed an unusual tactic to get a defendant to be quiet in his
     courtroom.

     While discussing the trial of accused Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik
     Hasan on Fox News' "Hannity," the outspoken congressman offered some
     advice for keeping order in the court.

     "I don't know the judge that's trying this case down in Fort Hood,"
     Gohmert said. "I had one guy that was particularly out of line, and
     I warned him three times, and then we duct taped his head, and we
     didn't hear from him until it was his turn to talk."

     He continued, "You just gave him three warnings, and then wrapped
     him up."

 Texas elects judges ([470]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [471]htowngenie, [472]Subterranean, [473]FarWestGirl

   The political parties have rigged the system to choose the most extreme
   representatives.

   Back when the state was going Republican state-wide all the judges
   either had to switch to the Republican Party (and appease the crazy
   evangelicals) or be defeated.

   With all the judges running for election in partisan elections, Texas
   ballots can run several pages of print. Most people have no clue who
   the down-ballot candidates are, so most voters simply vote a straight
   party ticket.

   Read the [474]2012 Republican Party of Texas Platform. It consists of
   radical political insanity committed to paper. As crazy as it looks,
   one provision is that any candidate supported by the Republican party
   must agree to fully support the platform or get no funding.

   So how does a platform like this get written? Delegates to the state
   party conventions are chosen at the election precinct level from those
   who voted on election day and who come back at 7:15 PM to participate
   in the caucus. As a Democratic Precinct chair running an election for
   five precincts with over 300 registered voters, only about 25 or 30
   even bother to vote in the primary. Then we normally had five people at
   the caucus - including me and my daughter. to fill 8 delegate slots at
   the county (or in urban areas, State Senate District) level.

   Republicans have the same system. The evangelical churches then send in
   ten people to each Republican caucus and the evangelicals literally own
   the Texas Republican Party. My precincts are majority Democrats as so
   many urban precincts are, but the Republicans also have a caucus and
   send delegates to their state convention.

   Hispanics and African Americans tend to not vote in part because
   -except in the rare minority majority district - they have no results
   from their votes. Why waste your time taking time off from work if your
   vote doesn't - and can't - matter?

   Any Republican nominated for a judgeship or Congressional seat has a
   cakewalk into office outside the large cities. They get funding from
   wealthy millionaire conservatives and foot soldiers from evangelical
   churches. In short, the system in Texas is designed to elect
   conservative crazies like Louie Gohmert, Steve Stockman and Ron Paul.

     That's a false narrative. He [Obama] says we're trying to keep
     people from getting health care. That's just not true.

     That's an absolute, blatant lie. We're not trying to keep anybody
     from getting health care. Whether or not they have insurance under
     an exchange or not does not prevent people from getting health care.
       When people have no money and no health insurance, they aren't
       going to get health care (especially inTX). That has been well
       documented, and it's a major reason why we need the ACA.

 Well now, isn't that interesting, that Gohmert ([545]0+ / 0-)
       claims he's not trying to stop people getting healthcare.
       About three weeks ago I had visitors from Europe who expressed a
       desire to visit the House and Senate galleries and observe a
       session of democracy in action.
       We did, but it was late on a Thursday afternoon so the House was
       virtually empty except for Gohmert and the pages.
       He droned on and on--I'm told he likes to speak late on Thursdays
       because he won't have to yield the floor.
       He equated Obamacare with NSA and other data gathering and drones
       and illegal immigration, because, you know, once freedom is gone
       it's gone and everyone would lose their freedom under Obama's
       healthcare so Gohmert would like to save everyone from that by
       doing away with Obamacare. And Obamacare would have everyone
       knowing everything about everyone else.
       We evidently hit the daily double because Gohmert was followed by
       Steve King. I thought my head was going to explode.
       I was saved at that point--my visitors wanted to leave because they
       said their English wasn't good enough to follow the arguments being
       declaimed to an empty House.
       I didn't say that my English wasn't good enough to understand
       Gohmert and King either--I didn't have the heart to disabuse them
       of their generally positive impression of the U.S. democratic
       process.

       tended to sound like a doctor's handwriting looks. But then, that's

       I still wish the bill to designate "Louie Louie" as the Washington
       state song had gotten through the Legislature. I mean, there's
       nothing wrong with "Washington My Home," but I don't think I've
       heard it since the Kennedy administration. No one knows the words
       to it any more than they do to Louie Louie, but the difference is
       you're not supposed to know the words to Louie Louie.

     A mid-decade redistricting made the 1st District significantly more
     Republican than its predecessor, notably by moving Gohmert's home in
     Tyler from the 4th to the 1st. Gohmert defeated Democratic incumbent
     1st District Congressman Max Sandlin with 61 percent of the vote to
     Sandlin's 39 percent, becoming the first Republican since
     Reconstruction to represent northeast Texas. In the Republican
     primary, Gohmert defeated State Representative Wayne Christian of
     Center, who thereafter returned to the state legislature but was
     unseated in the 2012 Republican primary. Gohmert has been elected
     four times with virtually no opposition. In 2006, Gohmert won his
     second term by defeating Democrat Roger L. Owen, a swimming pool
     builder from Hallsville. He faced no major party opposition in 2008
     or 2010. On November 6, 2012, Gohmert was elected to his fifth term
     with 182,621 votes (71.7 percent) to the Democrat Shirley J.
     McKellar's 67,758 (26.6 percent). The Libertarian Clark Patterson
     polled the remaining 1.6 percent of the ballots.

       either a 60 minutes or NBC report interviewing people from Louis's

       received the fewest number of votes anywhere in terms of

       of the world exists. Their sole concern is that the rest of America

     Donald Trump, Louie Gohmert Make Great Case For Why GOP Should Keep
     People Like Them Off TV

     This week, "This Week With George Stephopoulos" kicked off with a
     question: "Why is Donald Trump stumping in Iowa?" This answer to
     that question is that Trump is an orange-skinned huckster-clown who
     wants to pretend to be a big deal in politics and a perennial
     presidential contender, running on such policies as "Why do the
     Iraqis still have oil? We should take that for ourselves." He is the
     sort of buffoon that the Republican Party opted to keep far, far
     away from their convention -- and this was in spite of the fact that
     they nevertheless chose to allow Clint Eastwood to do the weird
     things that he did.
     It's a question that doesn't really ever need to be asked, let alone
     answered, on a Sunday show. I just took care of the matter and put
     it to bed in a paragraph. But "This Week" didn't just raise a dumb
     question and seek a trivial answer, they devoted a lot of time to a
     deep exploration on the matter.
     In addition, the bookers for "This Week" hit their rolodexes and
     decided that what the world needed was Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-Texas)
     on a panel. And over at "Meet The Press," producers booked Rep.
     Steve King (R-Iowa). After all, they wanted to have a discussion
     about comprehensive immigration reform, and how could you do such a
     thing without ol' Representative Cantaloupe Calves, right? I mean,
     if you don't book King, who knows what might happen? Two sides could
     work out their differences, or come to a genial understanding!

   Every time I see Louie Gohmert, I think of those clowns.  Every time I

   What do they have in common? All from Texas.

   Texas has become the new California (babbles, glazed eyeballs -- for
   those of you old enough to remember Mike Royko).

   Back in my heyday, we had characters such as J. William Fulbright
   (D-AK), Frank Church (D-ID), S.I. Hayakawa (R-CA), and William Proxmire
   (D-WI). Unlike the aforementioned buffoons from Texas, these guys were
   known for there eclectic intellect. Proxmire was the author of the
   Golden Fleece Award.

   So now the press spends much of its coverage on the low-end of the
   intelligence spectrum, whose total contribution to the political
   process consists of burp-fart.

   There was a day when some politicians (like the aforementioned
   Fulbright et al) caused us to scratch our heads because their
   intelligence a was bit too much for us plebeians to handle.

   Now-a-days, people like Gohmert have us wondering how someone so stupid
   could be a U.S. Congressman.

   Among the many things Gohmert doesn't understand is that host
   countries are responsible for security. I mean, think we would allow
   the Iranian UN mission--on 3rd avenue and 40th Street-- or the Russians
   embassy--a couple of blocks from the St. Alban School--to be ringed
   with missile launchers? Sure.

   There are things we can do to improve security in both peaceful
   countries and virtual war zone, e.g., Libya, but embassies aren't
   military bases.

   The Marine Corps itself makes this clear: "The primary mission of the
   Marine Security Guard (MSG) is to provide internal security at
   designated U.S. diplomatic and consular facilities in order to prevent
   the compromise of classified material vital to the national security of

   He is the dumbest member of Congress, but this isn't a prime example or
   really any example at all.  It's entirely within the realm of
   legitimate debate to say that our large-scale Embassy closures makes us
   look like cowards, and that we ought to learn from past security
   failures so we don't have to respond to threats so reflexively.  His
   Carter reference is a weaker link, but it's not like the desire for a
   large-scale military response, as opposed to negotiations or a commando
   raid, was some weird minority opinion at the time.

   We really should lay off the entirely arbitrary highlighting of usually
   unimportant things that our crazy adversaries say, and focus instead on
   the Whole Tapestry of Crazy.

 Why ([1087]0+ / 0-)

   is anyone surprised? Its Texas and its blood red district. There are
   literally tens of millions of US citizens who think like him. Its an
   issue
   that a significant % are clustered in essentially one Geographic area
   of the country. Its really about how a % of human beings react to
   change and diversity.

   We are not the only country struggling with extremist elements. Take
   a look at Norway with the political assassination of all those young
   people. Think of Germany, Italy & Spain in the 1930-1940. Then think of
   The Middle East. Lots of insanity worldwide, not just here.

 Why in the world would the rest of the world ([1093]0+ / 0-)

   think that the United States was a bunch of cowards?  We have been
   engaged now for more than a decade in a gallant war against the vast
   armies, navies, marines, and air forces of Al-Qaeda.  They started this
   war by sending a whole squadron of their best fighters all the way
   across the Atlantic Ocean armed only with box cutters to commandeer
   four airliners and turned those airliners into bombs against us.
   Imagine what damage they could have done if there had been two
   squadrons armed with, gasp, real Bowie knives?  We know these are
   fighters to be respected and feared because we have seen videos of
   their training regime scrambling across monkey bars in the desert.
   That is why we never, ever venture outside of our heavily fortified
   compounds without a convoy of heavily armed warriors supported by a
   full complement of fighter jets and attack helicopters, lest we should
   encounter one or two or, gasp, three of their best fighters.  We have
   increasingly come to rely on drones to attack the forces of Al-Qaeda
   piloted by remote control from highly fortified bunkers hidden in the
   mountains of Nevada.  That remote control killing is not cowardice, it
   is just a sniper taken to a whole new level, and we really like
   snipers, killing from a safe distance.  And that job carries a lot of
   stress, too.
   We closed our embassies across the middle east because we overheard a
   conversation between two of Al-Qaeda's top commanders (we're talking
   Field Marshal Rommel level here folks) and they said they hated the US
   and were going to scare us and make us look like cowards to the rest of
   the world.  We took that as a credible threat and so here we are.
   So Louie Gohmert, you are truly an idiot, but once in a while even an
   idiot says something with something to it.

 Ahhh... maybe not a "war crime" ([1099]0+ / 0-)

     I'm beginning to think that the mere act of handing Louie Gohmert a
     microphone should be treated as something close to a war crime.

   Because that would involve the hander of the mic actually being
   demonstrably involved in an actual war.

   But a crime against humanity?  Most certainly!

   I agree with everything you wrote EXCEPT

     But please, East Texas, if you're going to send paintlickers like
     this to higher office then message received: We'll let you secede
     already. We'll let you secede and give you a lifetime supply for all
     the paint you can huff.

   As you yourself said in a recent diary about Republicans watching too
   many Brady Bunch episodes...

     Greg only fell off his surfboard because Greg sucked, don't take it
     out on the whole state.

   Please consider removing the word "secede" from future diaries about
   Texas politics.  We progressives are working really hard to overcome
   these idiots in Texas and don't need the distraction.

   We are all in this together.

   It's just a new word for a particularly high-octane idiot.  As in,

   thing you found on the sidewalk!  What're you, some kind of a gohmert?"

 Louie Gohmert, stupidest man in Congress ([1118]0+ / 0-)

   I have always said it, and Gohmert just keeps on proving that he is by
   far the stupidest person in congress.

   Now that says a lot. After all there are many idiots in congress. The
   reason Gohmert is the worse, is he truly doesn't know how stupid he is.

   Now there are a few runners up.

   Virginia Foxx of NC has been high on the list for years, but of late
   hasn't been as visible.

   Paul Broun of GA who is a climate change denier and about as
   anti-science as they come who sits on the Science, Space and Technology
   Committee.

   The two Kings, Steve in Iowa and Peter in New York who sound stupid
   crazy, but are probably just cynical opportunists.

   And then there is Snow White herself. Michele Bachmann of MN. She puts
   the bat shit into Bat Shit Crazy.

   Gohmert just barely edged her out mainly because she is not above
   breaking the law to get what she wants, while Louie is to stupid to
   try.

   While all of this is sad, what is truly sad is the Sunday talking heads
   inviting Louie Gohmert and Steve King on to talk about their ideas.

   I get it. Invited some of the stupidest people on the planet to speak
   on the one day the major networks devote to political discourse to
   cynically generate viewers who for the most part were outraged you even
   invited them, and tuned in to see the train wreck.

   I don't know which is worse. The invitation or the cynicism and blatant
   trolling for viewers?

 whew! To read this is ([1121]0+ / 0-)

   just like watching Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector slice thin the
   meat of his victim and hanging it to dry- explaining what to do with
   the smoked remains as if he was Alton Brown on Good Eats. While
   oh.so.elegant, It makes me laugh so hard, coffee comes through my nose.

   The only regret I can imagine is that no matter who reads it out loud
   to Louis Gohmert, he is too stupid to comprehend it, and that must make
   you, as an artist, kinda sad. That he, Steve Stockman, Steve King, and
   Bachmann will just never know the Van Goghian blood you've poured into
   ripping them to shreds in a glorious rhetorical art of "pen"(ok blog
   post) starring as "sword"(ok, straight razor).

 Gohmert the Goober ([1124]0+ / 0-)

   I suspect that East Texas produces these idiot-heads because it is so
   rural and prone to what the AM radio says.

   Gohmert, however, is a prima facie example of why we should not go
   local in politics.  Why?  Because there's a conga line of idiot-heads
   even worse than Gohmert on the local level of East Texas politics.
