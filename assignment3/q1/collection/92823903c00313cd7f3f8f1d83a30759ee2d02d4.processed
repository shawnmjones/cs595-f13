[22]Guardian teams with the New York Times in effort to protect Snowden
documents

   [29]Alrighty then:

     The Guardian has struck a partnership with the New York Times which
     will give the US paper access to some of the sensitive cache of
     documents leaked by the National Security Agency whistleblower
     Edward Snowden. [...]

     It is intended that the collaboration with the New York Times will
     allow the Guardian to continue exposing mass surveillance by putting
     the Snowden documents on GCHQ beyond government reach. Snowden is
     aware of the arrangement.

   The premise of this is mostly legalistic, since in a world of flash
   drives and internets it is all but impossible for even a government to
   fetch back all copies of a given piece of data; giving the documents to
   an American outlet should in theory protect at least that copy of the
   documents via American laws protecting American journalists. Presuming
   those particular American laws protecting journalists still mean what
   we think they mean, anyway--we've had a bit of a bad stretch ourselves,
   on that point.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       the average schmuck read your documents, but despite Greenwald's

       "unbreakable," it probably only took a day or two for most of those

       As I understand it, quantum computers can be used to derive the
       algorythmic keys that are used to decrypt the method, because the
       encryption is not truly random.  This is, at heart, a number of
       n-bit length, where n is some power of 2, which is used as a seed
       to generate the pad that's used to encrypt the message.  (This
       explanation is very simplified but I believe it to be essentially
       correct.)
       Essentially, it's like the old Enigma machines, which work a
       similar encryption process, though orders of magnitude less
       sophisticated.
       A real one-time pad generated with a solid entropy source -is-
       truly random, and cannot be algorythmically derived.  It's as many
       bits long as the message it's encrypting is.  As the Wikipedia
       article on one-time pads states, 'theoretically perfectly secure;'
       the theoretical part is because the weakest part of one-time pad
       encryption is the fact that pads must be exchanged, and can thus be
       intercepted, or stolen.
       In practice, even a one-time pad using, say, a page of the bible,
       where both parties have a copy of the same edition, is Essentially
       Unbreakable, because, again, the pad cannot be algorythmically
       derived as it can be in an RSA and similar encryption schemes.

 How did they know? Think about it this way.... ([267]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [268]catullus

   They don't.  From everything I've read about this, Snowden's stuff was
   on computers that never touched the Internet.  Therefore it's harder
   for the NSA to reach out and suck the information out of their
   computers.

   I would assume at this point that the NSA really has no firm hand on
   what the reporters have.  (This in itself is a slap at the NSA's
   "accountability" and just how good/bad it is).

   So, detaining Miranda in an extra legal way was a quick (yet totally
   crass, style-less and indelicate) way of finding out at least some of
   the raw material Snowden took (and probably for the next story since
   Miranda was carrying it).

   Therefore, for the NSA, rather than be surprised at the next Greenwald
   revelation, now has some of the information (for sure) that Snowden
   took.  Now they can start to get their excuse story lined out before
   the next revelation and try to get ahead of the Oh Shit! curve with the
   next story.

   This also probably says something about the encryption that Poitras is
   using, they couldn't crack it in the 9 (?) hour time frame they had, if
   they had they would probably have given the stuff back to Miranda (or
   not).

   As for knowing who Miranda was, I suspect they knew that before the
   plane left Berlin (they really are spies after all).

   Disclaimer:  All my spy knowledge comes from Mission Impossible and
   Burn Notice.  So this is all idle speculation, I doubt if we will ever
   know what their true motive for intercepting Miranda was.

   There's a million ways Greenwald could get documents to and from

   My leading theories are:
   - NSA doesn't even know what Greenwald stole and wanted to find out.
   - gratuitous intimidation
   - British intelligence is significantly dumber than I would have
   guessed.

   Obviously could be something else. But it's not currently all adding

   ... their governmental duties to a corporation: [420]Booz Allen
   Hamilton (which has ties to the [421]Carlyle Group).  Snowden was
   working for Booz Allen Hamilton, not directly for the federal
   government.

   So, technically, while BAH may have given a copy to NSA, it's BAH who
   has classified documents.

   Never, ever forget that corporations now run the government when you
   scratch the surface.

   Our Congress Critters, both Dems and Repukes, have outsourced virtually
   all governmental operations to corporations, from war (mercenaries from
   several different corporations) to the healthcare system (wherein
   insurance, medical, and pharmaceutical corporations stand to make
   record-setting profits), to allegedly classified 'top secret' documents
   and hoovering up all of our electronic communications to store the data
   until such time as they may want to use it (probably to blackmail
   someone, or many someones, or use the data as the basis of charging
   people for crimes, even "secret" crimes known only to "secret" courts).

   I'd be willing to bet that a huge percentage of the documents that have
   illegally and unconstitutionally been classified involve data no one
   cares about, but in a zeal for all this top secret crap the documents
   have been classified anyway..., just to keep us from knowing how many
   illegal and unconstitutional avenues our government has gone down.

   Just knowing they have "secret interpretations of laws known only to
   secret courts" is enough to let me know that what they're doing is so
   illegal and unconstitutional as to be horrifying when we find out what
   they've done.  Our Constitution does not provide for a secret or shadow
   behind-the-scenes government operation.  Our Constitution provides for
   a transparent republican form of government with touches of democracy -
   nowhere in the Constitution will you find a militaristic or "secret"
   government provision.

   to maintain their own credibility to protect secrets and sources.

   The full, unredacted set of Manning Wikileaks files was not supposed to
   go public. It was a two-part fuck-up between a lapse in
   compartmentalization by Assange and the public release of an encryption
   key by a misguided Guardian reporter. Assange gave the Guardian

     Britain runs a secret internet-monitoring station in the Middle East
     to intercept and process vast quantities of emails, telephone calls
     and web traffic on behalf of Western intelligence agencies, The
     Independent has learnt.

     The station is able to tap into and extract data from the underwater
     fibre-optic cables passing through the region.

     The information is then processed for intelligence and passed to
     GCHQ in Cheltenham and shared with the National Security Agency
     (NSA) in the United States. The Government claims the station is a
     key element in the West's "war on terror" and provides a vital
     "early warning" system for potential attacks around the world.

       which was stupid of them, imo.  They should have let other people
       make that kind of unsupported accusation.

       The weird thing about the Independent story is that it is not
       exactly like the other stories we've seen come from Snowden which
       have typically been more focused on the broad overview of the spy
       apparatus.  But the story that the Independent published
       specifically talks about a monitoring station - which is a physical
       entity and there is no surprising information about their actual
       activities - and then according to the coverage, I've seen, the
       Independent says that this story shows how compromising the
       information Snowden has is - which is weird because if they really
       believed it to risk security, they should not have published the
       story in the first place - and they would not have, either.  All of
       these media outlets check with government when they believe they
       have information related to national security before they publish
       the information - and they typically have other sources who would
       have some ability to estimate the potential for harm.
       The PPT deck that Snowden gave the Post according to Gellman was
       like 48 slides and the Post chose to limit their disclosure to just
       four having decided, based on conversations with government and
       other experts, that the others were too sensitive to publish.
       Anyway, we are witnessing bits and pieces of an infowar here.  Hard
       to tell exactly what's going on.

       is pretty stupid, but a closer review of how he's handled this
       whole thing since it first started getting attention in June
       (bragging that he worked with Snowden from before he stole the
       materials, then walking that back; using Hong Kong as a safe haven
       only to find it wasn't the best choice; having Wikileaks/FSB help
       get Snowden to Russia and the loving arms of Putin) hasn't been
       what one would call playing smart.
       As for what's being reported - Greenwald is quick to point out that
       he alone knows what Snowden is doing and whom he talks to.  As has
       been pointed out, the more he blurs the line between activist and
       journalist, the more he hurts his own cause.  One can't be a
       catalyst or drive the narrative and a believable objective reporter
       of that same narrative.  For example, his obsession with trying to
       get as much TV time as possible while claiming this story isn't
       about himself.

 Greenwald hurts himself, but that's nothing ([578]0+ / 0-)
       new.  He isn't great about self editing - he tends to say what's on
       his mind without thinking about it.  That doesn't necessarily mean
       that he's not telling the truth.  I actually think he often "over
       shares", as it were.
       There have been a few things along the way that he has said that
       would have made me nervous if I had been one of his sources.  Not
       to mean that I think he's said anything to reveal sources, but I
       have heard him say some things where it sounded like he was
       offering up more information than was required at the time.  Maybe
       it was strategic and smart in ways that we do not know right now,
       but it seemed to me like he was unnecessarily tipping his hand.
       The Times story about Poitras and her means of moving information
       also sounded like she's incredibly naive, but maybe she had a
       reason to have that story documented publicly.
       My guess is that this saga is going to go on for some time to come
       and that it will get weirder before it gets clearer.

       He's not asking the Independent to out their source, but they can
       clear up the confusion:

     The Independent's Oliver Wright just tweeted the following:

         "For the record: The Independent was not leaked or 'duped' into
     publishing today's front page story by the Government."
     Leaving aside the fact that the Independent article quotes an
     anonymous "senior Whitehall source", nobody said they were "duped"
     into publishing anything. The question is: who provided them this
     document or the information in it? It clearly did not come from
     Snowden or any of the journalists with whom he has directly worked.
     The Independent provided no source information whatsoever for their
     rather significant disclosure of top secret information. Did they
     see any such documents, and if so, who, generally, provided it to
     them? I don't mean, obviously, that they should identify their
     specific source, but at least some information about their basis for
     these claims, given how significant they are, would be warranted.
     One would think that they would not have published something like
     this without either seeing the documents or getting confirmation
     from someone who has: the class of people who qualify is very small,
     and includes, most prominently and obviously, the UK government
     itself.

       bureaucracies, I can totally see that.  He could have just snagged
       whole folders of the documents relating to those programs and
       readily amassed that many documents.  You're assuming that the
       information he has is unrelated to the information he has already

 When is a journalist, not a journalist? ([634]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [635]yorkiedoglover

   There is a real problem with this situation. The distinction is
   precisely what are the Times and the Guardian trying to do?

   If they are forcing a specific story, issue, or other journalistic
   activity to the surface for the public to understand and fight for then
   that is what they are there for. But this ambiguous "protecting" of
   data acquired by Snowden from the US Govt isn't a journalist's job.
   They are working counter to the government and heading for a real
   showdown.

   Whistleblowing is by definition the release of some piece of
   information that leads to an illegal activity on the some entities'
   part. It is not the wholesale abduction of classified data that may or
   may not be part of the illegal act so that you can hold as insurance.
   The Times is likely going to run afoul of the DOJ if they keep leaking
   information stating they have access to this classified data from
   Snowden. And it won't be pretty.

   What the NSA did and is doing is unethical and needs changing now. But
   what the Times is doing is going to damage our journalistic safety net
   that is supposed to keep the government officials in check. You can't
   act outside the law and pretend that you aren't damaging the very thing
   you are trying to protect.

   The DOJ and intelligence agencies won't stop until this data is
   recovered and the scope of the damage identified. Let's end this before
   we do more damage to our democracy.

       ...You can act outside the law and claim you aren't damaging what
       you're trying to protect, when the laws are illegal or unethical.
       So far, none of the information released by the Guardian has shown
       anything other than a vast and unconstitutional
       information-harvesting effort.
       The government hasn't said what else Snowden took, so as far as I'm
       concerned, it's probably all of a similar nature -- information
       about programs, not anything that really damages national security.
        Perhaps actual intercepted information to show that it can and has
       been done.
       It's illegal for a government employee or contractor to leak
       classified documents.  It's not illegal, AFAIK, for someone who
       received those documents to posess or share them.

     But this ambiguous "protecting" of data acquired by Snowden from the
     US Govt isn't a journalist's job. They are working counter to the
     government and heading for a real showdown.
       (emphasis added.)
       THAT IS PRECISELY THE JOB OF THE PRESS.  The reason we have
       'freedom of the press' is so that the Press can freely call the
       Government on their shit, to disburse to the public what the
       governement may not want them to know.  The Press is supposed to be
       the enemy of the Government, at least when the government's pulling
       shit they shouldn't be doing.
       The data's out there.  It's impossible to 'recover'.  It's
       impossible to know how many copies exist at this point.
       Let the DOJ come.  Force a crisis.  Let all of the rats know the
       ship is sinking, and force them to recognize that it must be fixed,
       or let them stand by while we hasten the process to send it to the
       bottom of the ocean.

       You said,

     So far, none of the information released by the Guardian has shown
     anything other than a vast and unconstitutional
     information-harvesting effort.
       So far, everything is held up by the FISA court as legal albeit by
       a classified ruling. This was put through a legal process and
       provided cover. That much is true. Being "unethical" goes without
       saying. This is why we need to keep pushing to make these secret
       rulings become public and bring this back into the public court
       system to be given a fair debate. By calling it illegal is just
       your opinion and judgement. I don't disagree that it should be
       struck down as illegal, but at the time it was given legal cover so
       we can't decide this without a real court taking it up.

     It's not illegal, AFAIK, for someone who received those documents to
     posess or share them.
       Actually, you are wrong in that respect. It makes you an accessory
       in some situations. And possession of classified information is
       quite similar to be knowingly in possession of stolen goods.

     The government hasn't said what else Snowden took, so as far as I'm
     concerned, it's probably all of a similar nature -- information
     about programs, not anything that really damages national security.
       So you are assuming that it's not going to damage national
       security. That is a big assumption and you base this on what?
       Nothing. The whole reason this is a big problem is because we don't
       know what he took from the NSA. And since you haven't a clue what
       he took you can't assume anything. Neither can I. He didn't just
       take someone's Basketball Picks from their office pool. He dumped
       classified data from the NSA computers. That could be very damaging
       to national security depending on what was in it.
       The reason the NSA doesn't know what he took is obvious and they
       will take the Times apart looking for it in every hard drive and
       flash drive if they claim to have it. There is a crime in
       possessing classified data without the proper clearance or
       authority. The press is allowed to report stories divulging
       criminal conspiracies by the government, but what it is doing is
       more than that. It is crossing a bright line making itself a
       criminal conspirator after the fact.
       When the media obtains classified data that is leaked, responsible
       organizations speak with the agencies involved asking for comment
       before printing these documents. They have the responsibility not
       to endanger persons by releasing it. But if the agencies do not
       know what the Times has in it's possession at the moment then they
       might consider this a threat to national security and take it from
       them. The media needs to not create this situation. If there is a
       story in this data then they need to come out with it in
       discussions with the agencies involved. As it is they are treading
       dangerously.

     Discussions of how to partner on the documents were carried out in
     person between top Guardian editors and Times executive editor Jill
     Abramson, all of whom declined to comment on the movement of
     documents. But it appears likely that someone at one of the two
     papers physically carried a drive with Snowden's GCHQ leaks from
     London to New York or Washington -- exactly what Miranda was stopped
     at Heathrow for doing.

     Abramson declined, in a brief telephone interview from Boston, to
     "comment on any of that," and stressed that she would not discuss
     the subject on her mobile telephone because "my cell phone is not a
