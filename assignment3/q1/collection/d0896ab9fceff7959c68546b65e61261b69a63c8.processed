   young black man crying
   I thought I knew all about why it was wrong to use the n-word. Having
   taught and written about racism in America, I've read the words of
   those a scholar would read: [29]David Walker, Frederick Douglass,
   [30]Sojourner Truth, W.E.B. Dubois, James Baldwin, Martin Luther King,
   Cornel West. But it was a football player who really touched me when he
   explained just what a black person feels when he hears that vile slur.

   This month Cris Carter was inducted into the pro football Hall of Fame.
   He [31]appeared last Thursday on ESPN Radio's "Mike and Mike," and
   talked about his playing days and his upcoming book. Co-host Mike
   Greenberg then turned to another subject. A few days before the Hall of
   Fame inducted Carter, a visibly angry Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver
   named Riley Cooper was caught on tape using the aforementioned slur. He
   announced that he would "fight every n-----" at a Kenny Chesney
   concert.

   The Eagles [32]fined and [33]suspended Cooper, sending him to
   counseling for four days and then allowing him to return to practice.
   The team's best player, runningback LeSean McCoy, [34]said that he
   forgives Cooper, but noted his pain as well over "losing a friend ... I
   can't respect a guy like that."

   Back to the radio interview, where Greenberg asked Carter for his
   perspective on what Cooper had said and how he might feel having Cooper
   as a teammate. Carter talked about how difficult forgiveness would be.
   He doubted that Cooper really understood "the magnitude of that word
   ... how harmful it can be." Carter then laid it out for Cooper, and for
   anyone listening.

   "He does not know," Carter said of Cooper, "how many people in my race
   that that was the last word they heard before they died." Those words
   came out of my car radio speakers and took my breath away. I'm lucky no
   other driver picked that moment to stop short in front of me.

   Listening to those words again just now, I hear the depth of emotion
   behind them. I also hear something I didn't pick up when I first heard
   Carter's voice: seven thumps--which can only be him pounding his hand
   on a hard surface--emphasizing each of the seven words that ended his
   comment: Last. Word. They. Heard. Before. They. Died.

   Please follow me for more after the fold.

   I had long known it was a word that slaveowners had used, that Klansmen
   had used, that whites (and not a few non-whites) have aimed at black
   Americans in every region of our country right up to the present day.
   Cris Carter was the one who truly humanized the experience for me
   (others, including [35]Oprah Winfrey just this month, have expressed
   similar sentiments). I thought about a man hearing that word ringing in
   his ears as he hung from a tree, struggling to draw his last breath, or
   a woman hearing it just before she was whipped into unconsciousness. I
   envisioned African Americans seeing those images when they heard that
   word.

   Carter didn't provide a number, but almost 3,500 black Americans were
   [36]lynched in the years after 1882 (no reliable statistics exist
   before that year). How many tens of thousands of others were murdered
   by one method or another in the name of white supremacy? How many
   countless others were tortured or beaten? Historians can only guess.

   We have made tremendous progress as a society when it comes to racism.
   However, we have by no means conquered it. It would be a great thing if
   no one ever used that word to slur a black person again, if the use of
   all hateful slurs simply ceased. Such developments, however, would not
   end the discrimination black Americans face today, or undo the legacy
   of the even harsher discrimination of the past. Such developments
   wouldn't educate any children, lift any families out of poverty, or
   eliminate racial disparities in drug sentencing. But they would mean a
   great deal.

   My hope is that all the people who heard Cris Carter felt what I felt.
   My hope is that hearing directly from someone about the pain and hurt
   racism doles out leads great numbers of people to not just avoid the
   worst of racial slurs, but to take active steps to bring about greater
   justice.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [57]Tagging tips - [58]Search For Tags - [59]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [60]Civil
   Rights, [61]Community, [62]Congress, [63]Culture, [64]Economy,
   [65]Education, [66]Elections, [67]Energy, [68]Environment, [69]Health
   Care, [70]International, [71]Labor, [72]Law, [73]Media, [74]Meta,
   [75]National Security, [76]Science, [77]Transportation, or [78]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([79]California, [80]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       made a visit to African to connect to his roots and to understand
       where his ancestors came from.  Richard Pryor used to say the n
       word all the time in his comedy acts.  When he got back from Africa
       he said he would never say the n word ever again.  He said to say
       the n word is to disrespect himself and all AAs.  I agree.  The n
       word spoken by anyone is unacceptable.

 one explanation for in group use of the word ([382]17+ / 0-)

       was the word was used as a weapon for centuries.  To have the
       victims claim the word as their own limited its potency.  This is a
       nice theory but in practice, RWers have turned the reasons behind

       And I understand this, and have for a long time through a very

       understands the "reclaim it" argument, she wants that word to go
       away. Forever. Or as she herself said, "There really isn't any
       reclaiming of that word. It's a miserable hate filled word, and no
       one black can change that now. And a lot of us don't want to. Too
       many bad memories."
       Just one black woman's opinion. However, this particular black
       woman has a lantern in her soul. As a white person, I often feel
       confused and destined to be wrong commenting on a culture I'm not a
       part of, and have not suffered along with. So I listen to those who
       really have a dog in the game.

       dealing with some RW folks.  For my daughter and granddaughters, I
       want the word to go away.  One granddaughter, in particular, has
       many white playmates but I also know, from other sources, that when
       she is not present, her playmates' parents use that word to refer
       to her.  (I would also point out the ones most likely to do this
       have also been less successful in life and so it seems to comfort
       them to denigrate a 9 year old girl behind her back because her
       family has enjoyed some success)

       It's not just that she's older, it's that she has children and
       grand children she thinks first about these days. She just doesn't
       want it a part of their life, for any reason.
       And yes, it is often those who either have a grudge against a less
       successful life, and feel the need to take that out on someone
       else, who are hurling this word around.
       OTOH, there are plenty of white people, educated white people who
       would never get caught dead using that word, but who still have
       their own unconscious racism. So even if we make that word go away,
       there's plenty of code words for the same thing, for those in the
       know about how to get away w/it.
       For instance, I was recently chatting w/an enormously talented
       black man trying to break into the ad business as a voice over and
       on camera talent. He told me he has often been told he's just too
       "urban" for the part. Eye roll. Sometimes I'm not sure what's
       worse. The use of an obviously derogatory term to most, or the use
       of code words that ultimately say the same thing.

       I also think it's partly a generational thing with the n word. I'm

       husband & I, especially my husband as he's a jazz musician that
       gets around more than me in my small New England college town, have
       adult black friends. Now my sons have black friends all over the
       place as they play sports and go to camps and stay in touch with
       lots of kids of all races. Their friends come to our house and go
       on vacation with us, etc.
       Now the adults, including me, all hate the n word and find it
       unacceptable to use by anyone. My kids are in a different place.
       THEY would NEVER use it but they are not bothered by their AA
       friends using it. Not all of them use it. The kids with professors
       for parents tend not to except when they want to freak their
       parents out as all good teens do. But my kids are are completely OK
       with the reality that it is inappropriate for anyone but an AA
       person to use the n word and it's like a complete non-event to
       them.

       part of anyone's DNA. I think we're raised into it. And although I
       understand your metaphor of a "virus" here, can't really quite go
       w/that either.
       I have seen people "recover" from their ignorant and racially
       tinged upbringings. I have seen people evolve to a higher, if not
       perfect, plane. I have seen people never look back to what they
       once, wrongfully, thought. And I include myself in that, although I
       was not raised to be a racist, and have never intentionally or
       consciously been one.
       But I did have to learn that the comments I make on race, are only
       from a white person's POV. I did have to learn that as much as I
       want to understand, as much as I want to do the right thing, I am
       hampered by not walking in those shoes. Fact is, I have never been
       attacked, suspected, looked down upon, arrested falsely, stopped
       and frisked, followed around in a store, or accused of all manner
       of things because I am white. Never. I am humbled by my lack of
       experience in such things.
       So that, I think, ultimately, keeps me as free as I can be from the
       "curse." When you are finally humble enough to just say, don't know
       for sure about these things, because I haven't lived them, then
       hopefully, for me, you're on a path that isn't guaranteed to be
       fragile, like alcoholism, a disease that effects people without
       respect to color.
       I do think we can learn things, and move up and beyond our former
       mistakes. Sure, lots don't. But many do. And there you have
       it---the same old imperfect world it's always been, with some
       despair, and some hope.

       other places we all converge. And honestly, I just think of it as
       rude, I don't think of it as race based. I think that individual,
       white or black, is just not my kind of person.
       Frankly, I have too much good experience with both races, to think
       any differently.

       There comes a point when you simply respect the fact that this

       people who have never a day in their life experienced the same.
       There comes a point when you understand that these kind of

   Her playmates parents are still using that word?

   Are you posting this from 1973?

   Its been years since I met ANYONE who felt it was ok to use the word,
   other than an occasional African American in internal conversation. And
   even then, its a word people only say under particular circumstances.

   I'd be calling them out very vocally in as public a situation as I
   could come up with if I came across that situation with parents of a
   grandchild's friends. I'd make sure I was as rude and nasty as it took
   to chase them off for good and get people "talking about me"...

   Rather I became a pariah than have to have a member of my family
   socializing with peers who's parents were going to disrespect her like
   that.

   Growing up I had an aunt who would note her displeasure at the
   existence of me, with terms like mongrel, assorted slang for Chinese,
   half-breed, and so on. None of the adults did anything, I presume
   figuring I didn't hear their conversations in other rooms... But I did,
   and I also noticed how that set of cousins were less friendly over the
   years than the rest of them...

   Its one then to have strangers be racist at you - you have to grow a
   thick skin against that to survive... its a whole other thing when its
   friends or family...

       people you would never suspect: Doctors, lawyers, religious

       Oneof my favorite jokes to tell is when I lean in close to a group
       of people I know have racist tendencies and I say softly, "Do you
       know how every racist joke starts?" I then pause and look at each
       one of them in the eye and after sufficient time has passed, I
       dramatically look over each shoulder as if to check to see if
       anyone who is not racist might overhear and then just stare at
       them.
       Everybody always gets the joke because that is always how racists
       jokes start, in a cowardly manner to ensure that no one else hears
       them being a racist.  Oh, they'll say that it is to protect the
       "Others" from hearing an "off color" joke and that they are just
       poking fun and the "Others" are too sensitive and would go off
       pulling the race card and such.
       Whenever I hear someone telling a racist joke,I use the same line
       everytime.  I say, "You know the only thing I hate worse than a
       (fill in the appropriate derogatory name used in the joke or
       comment)?  a bigot". and I walk away leaving them thinking about
       and trying to figure out what I just meant.  Calling them a racist
       doesn't work because they have a whole line of justifications
       already preplanned to defend themselves against such an accusation.
        I leave them wondering what I meant and hopefully, they think
       maybe for the first time whather or not they fall within that
       category.

   Carter's and hit me just as hard.  He said he used the word as a kid
   and his father, a preacher, told him that was the last word many of his
   ancestors heard before they died, so why would he want to use it?  I
   couldn't help but think that is the perfect response to my aging

       those ethnic jokes that are just too funny not to retell (this was
       in the era of Pollack jokes), replace the ethnicity in the joke
       with one's own.  This doesn't work for all jokes but it does work
       for a surprisingly high number with just a little adjustment.

                [636]Ian Reifowitz

       to think about, is that I have noticed that certain "ethnic" jokes
       don't anger people. For instance, in my part of the country Ollie
       and Lena jokes are common, referencing the scandinavian culture as
       it figures in greatly where I live. No one is ever offended. Why?
       Because Ollie and Lena never suffered what other folks have because
       they are who they are, and part of the culture they are. I think
       this is key, and the exception, not the rule.
       OTOH, I once stopped a fun dinner party cold when a stated liberal
       told a gentle but derogatory gay joke. Told him he could shove that
       where the moon don't shine, and he was and is still, a friend. And
       I don't regret it. It was uncomfortable, but I'll be damned if I'm
       going to listen to that without comment. And I'm pretty sure he's
       thinking twice about telling gay jokes these days.
       There's so much that's funny in this world, about humans in
       general, that we won't have any dearth of laughs if we stick to
       what you laid out.

   A recoil as if being gut-punched.  A local guy doing some plumbing work
   for me used it in a sort of sideways reference (relatively speaking --
   it had nothing to do with POC when he said it) as we were walking and
   talking, and I stopped walking before I knew it.  I didn't look at him,
   but he said, "I'm sorry to use that word, but I don't know any other
   phrase for it."  I still didn't look at him.  Just said, "find another
   one," and left it at that.  The guy had made my yard look like the
   Tunguska meteor strike while searching for an underground leak, and I
   needed him to put it all back kind of like it was, or I might have
   engaged him further in the conversation.  At least he felt
   uncomfortable enough to apologize.  Don't think he'll use that word
   around me again, and might even think about using in at all.

   I've thrown people out of my house, or ordered them off my "property"
   (a word I don't normally use to describe the land that lets me live on
   it) for using that word, or the kinds of references that generally
   accompany it.  But Carter's simple, seven-word description is
   incredibly powerful.  It makes the ultimate point about it with amazing
   economy.

   It looks ugly. It sounds ugly.

   And, of course, the history behind the word defines ugliness.

   husband's dowager aunt was using the word. It was a word I never heard

   rarely hear that word because all the people near and dear to me don't

   informed that I don't tolerate use of that word, or any other racial
   slurs.

   My toddler is now 43 years old and is passing the tradition on to her
   toddler. It would be a nicer world if that word and other racial words
   were eradicated from the vocabulary altogether.

   I hope I don't give the wrong impression with this, but...

   Though i fully understand that the word is used commonly among the AA
   community as a way of 'defanging' it, none the less the fact that its
   now so used and intertwined with music and culture I see a lot of
   potential for future misunderstanding.

   I've hung out with guys that were all AA, but me and even though they
   used the word commonly, I wouldn't for obvious reasons even though they
   knew I was cool, my own awkwardness would of made it at best a little
   funny, and possibly offensive.

   People of a younger generation may only know the word from its modern
   'dude' like usage which could lead to misunderstandings.

   My point is that eventually the word needs to lose its negativity or
   the AA community and artist need to stop using it so freely.

   It needs to either be a disgusting word  or one that has morphed and no
   longer connotes its previous intent.

       no matter what the future brings, if said by the right person in
       the right way there is no doubt they are using it as a slur.
       Not sure if there is any option but to leave the word for the
       dustbin of history only spoken from the lips of racists.
       In a way this would kill the word even sooner because if no one
       said it but the occasional racist it would stand out even more and
       likely cause reactions that would cause the speaker to feel less
       comfortable with the word.
       Though this is unlikely as well and I guess i'm just pointing out

   week visit. At 15 he knows far too much about racial discrimination and
   has been repeatedly stopped for walking while black in the mostly white
   neighborhood where he, his brother and mother live.

   What I suggested to him is that we may be approaching a tipping point.
   Just like we did on equal marriage rights. There will come a day or an
   event, that stops and shocks the people of this country, somewhat like
   the use of fire hoses and dogs against protestors by Bull Connor in
   Birmingham did in 1963. It may have already come with the acquittal of
   George Zimmerman. Or it may come tomorrow. And it may take the form of
   single small events, like Cris Carter's remarks, that work as drips of
   acid on a chain until the chain finally snaps.

   But when it happens, the majority of people in this country, who I
   still believe are people of good will, will demand the cessation of
   hate speech of racial slurs.

   One time as we were walking out in the street. Needless to say, I was
   completely at a loss for a response. Luckily we were in a foreign
   country, where most of the population very likely does not know the
   loaded connotations and negative history associated with the word, so
   the fallout with others was nonexistent.

   However, we had a very lengthy conversation about why that's completely
   unacceptable language, and what would be the repercussions of using
   such language in the US.

   To this day, I am still flummoxed why she would have thought to use
   that word, given that she grew up outside of the United States in a
   non-English-speaking country, and should likely have never heard that
   word being used in the first place. (It's one of many, many reasons
   she's now my ex.)

   Rush claims he now has a right to use the "N word" as he will and other
   RW talkers chime in.  They refuse to understand that the word has
   history; they refuse to consider that the use of certain words within a
   group vs its use outside of the group can be so very, very different;
   they decry that "cracker" is as potent an insult as "N" but no white
   man was ever lynched with the sign "cracker" around his neck.

   I read the considered explanation of the use of the word by various
   rappers and entertainers where the explanation was that they were not
   leaders in the community but were entertainers.  Emmett Kelly was a
   white entertainer but no one suggests Rush should show up for work in a
   clown suit or clown shoes or do Dick Van Dyke pratfalls.  Also, many of
   those who use the word in group are younger and perhaps did not
   experience what older African Americans endured routinely and perhaps
   don't fully understand the substantial baggage the word carries

       I grew up in a house where, although my mother never used the word,
       my father said "nigra." Not all that often, but still... He knew
       the "n" word was bad; this was his way of getting around it.

       The first federal anti-lynching law was not passed until 1968, when
       lynching was specifically criminalized by federal legislation by
       the Civil Rights Act. 1968!
       Think about that. One hundred and ten years after the end of the
       Civil War. Twenty-three years after the end of WWII.
       In 2005, the U.S. Senate approved a resolution apologizing for its
       failure to enact federal anti-lynching legislation.
       One-hundred and five years after the first anti-lynching bill was
       proposed by a black congressman, senators approved by a voice vote
       Resolution 39, which called for the lawmakers to apologize to
       lynching victims, survivors and their descendants, several of whom
       watched from the gallery.
       Why was it necessary to pass a federal anti-lynching law?
       Because some states refused to pass a state anti-lynching law. With
       the passage of the federal anti-lynching law, to this very day,
       some states never passed a state anti-lynching law.

       is probably one of the top three things in the world to get worked
       up about.
       Even though it took until 1968 to pass the law, lynchings did
       continue with the lynching of Michael Donald by the Klan in 1981.
       Not far removed from actual lynching was the 1998 dragging death of
       James Byrd, Jr in Jasper, Texas by a few good ole' boys -- same
       same if you ask me.
       Equal rights/treatment/respect for our AA brothers and sisters has
       been an inexcusably slow and agonizing fight,  far longer than
       equal rights and pay for women and far longer than equal rights for
       LBGT persons.  The injustice of it simply breaks my heart.

   (while her older sister was called cracker bitch). I had a very long
   talk with both just this weekend, after the first week of school, about
   the hurt involved with ANY name calling but those words especially.

   However I wish the community here, and at large would find equal
   disgust at the black use of the very same word. The self abasement and
   self loathing that is furthered when a rapper, movie start or local kid
   uses that word also disgusts me. The klansmen would be happily
   surprised that the N word is used so liberally among the African

   to hear it used approvingly - in popular culture is terribly, terribly

   parents and uncles grew up on the Eastern Tennessee/Kentucky border.
   After marrying, they all moved North to Ohio an Michigan. There were
   five brothers, all WWII or Korean Veterans and their father, who
   everyone called Papaw. Papaw was this old guy sitting in a wheelchair
   with one eye smoking an old pipe. He'd worked the coal mines for many
   years and had lost an eye in the mines. This would have been around
   1971 when I was dating my future wife. I noticed early that my wife's
   father had zero tolerance for the n word. He gave his youngest son a
   whipping one Sunday when we were eating supper for saying it. This was
   the same way I grew up - you just didn't say the n word. Even though I
   was only 18 or so, I was still amazed that a family of Southern whites
   had those ethics concerning race. I'd been under the misguided
   impression that all Southern whites were racists.
   So, I was talking to Papaw one day and was pleasantly surprised to find
   out how sharp the old guy was. He told me about the mines, hunting and
   trapping when he was a kid, and then this. He told me that during WWII
   there was a Civil Defense in their area and the older guys would pull
   guard duty on the railroad trestles. He said " Many times we'd go to
   guard the bridge and there'd be a Darkie hanging on it from the night
   before." I could have fell over. I asked him to repeat it because I
   didn't understand. He said " them boys would get liquored up the night
   before an go get them a Darkie and hang him." Then he shook his head
   and wouldn't talk about anymore. I asked my future father-in-law about
   it and he said it was true. The local klan and hooligans would get all
   gooned up and do it just for fun. I asked him where the law was at and
   he said they'd turn their backs on it. It just freakin floored me. At
   that time I thought that shit ended in the 1800's. I asked my father-in
   law about Papaw calling the victims Darkies and wasn't that
   disrespectful. He said that's what the old guys called Blacks in that
   area back then and that he meant no disrespect. He said Papaw had many
   Black friends. These people were/are die-hard Democrats. I sensed they
   moved North for jobs but also to get away from shit like that.

   Thank you for writing this. While my two anecdotes do not involve
   people using the "N" word, they both illustrate how persistently the
   legacy of racism endures.

   When I was attending the 2008 Gullah Institute on St. Helena Island
   (South Carolina), two things left a profound impression on me. First,
   two of the black attendees (women with advanced degrees, hailing from
   Denver) related how, when they went shopping in nearby Beaufort, they
   were followed around the store by a white sales clerk from the moment
   they entered till the moment they left.

   Second, Emory Campbell (MS, Environmental Engineering), a Gullah
   community leader who was one of the featured teachers/speakers at the
   Institute, told students that members of three generations of his
   family are buried in Braddocks Point Cemetery on Hilton Head Island. In
   order to visit their graves, he must "check in" with the guard at the
   entrance to the exclusive gated community that now surrounds the
   cemetery. The total number of people interred there  is difficult to
   determine, because some graves are almost certainly  located under the
   golf course that was built next to (and partially overlapping) the
   cemetery.

   I have never understood white people who argue (obviously, this is a
   paraphrase): "Black people use that word all the time! Why can't I use
   it?" The simple answer to that question is another question: "Why do
   you want to?"

   Finally, one of my favorite fictional discussions of the "N" word
   appeared in the first episode of Scrubs:

     J.D.: You know how I'm totally down with the rap music?
     Turk: Dude, be whiter.
     J.D.: Here's the thing: TuPac, DMX, Dr. Dre, in most of their songs,
     these artists use an extremely volatile racial slur...the "N" word.
     Turk: I got it.
     J.D.: Right. My question is this: If we're both singing along, and
     knowing that otherwise I would never use the word, am I allowed to
     say . . .
     Turk: No.

   Good enough for me.

   in my neighborhood it's every other word out of peoples' mouths? "Nigga
   this and nigga that, my nigga," etc. etc. and don't give me the
   softened R argument or the fact that it's ok for them to say it. It's
   either totally wrong and offensive or it isn't. There is no except or
   but. I agree that it is completely offensive but if you can't respect
   yourself to stop using the word when you are referring to your friends
   or yourself how can you expect anyone else to have respect for you not
   to use it? Btw I am not a troll, or right-wing by any stretch of the
   imagination and I don't live in some lily white suburb where I have no
   interaction with African Americans. I live in The Tenderloin in San
   Francisco, CA  and I have no nose down in so I know what I speak of.

       It's a very good question. African Americans are working it out for
       themselves, and engaged in serious debate on it.

   ...my family and the only other Indians in town were called "red
   n-----s" to our faces--even though a third of us were light-skinned
   enough to pass for white among people who didn't know who we were. My
   grandfather was a tough guy, but he knew that objecting to that slur
   would have gained him nothing but a beating, so he swallowed his pride
   and put up with it. When we moved briefly to Nebraska in 1955, my
   mother came to pick me up at the end of the first day of third grade,
   which was already halfway through the school year. The next day on the
   playground, a sixth-grader taunted me: Your mom has n****r lips." I
   kicked him in the shin and he hit me with a rolled up newspaper,
   nicking the skin above my eye and making the blood flow like crazy, as
   it so often does from face wounds.

   My mother had to leave work to pick me up. She told me I shouldn't
   fight even after I told her what had sparked it. "Somebody says that,
   ya just ignore it," she said.

   I've never hit anybody again for saying that word in my presence. But I
   have never ignored it

   and soooooooo many use these words.  Words have consequences.   I
   appreciate what MB just said as recently and very recently I might add
   my husband found out something.   He is Native American from the Lumbee
   tribe which inter racially married thus giving them problems with
   Tribal recognition.   I always felt like my husband's Mother had more
   African American features than white,
   I never met her but just saw photos.   As he got into ancestory .com
   last week..He got her info and did a background search on she and his
   grandfather who raised only her out of 6 children.   This was unheard
   of in the early part of the century...  The mother raising all but one
   child....????  The census report stated his
   name.....age...race...negro..black.   Same thing for his Mother.  They
   lived in a small fishing town and there is no telling the abuse they
   took.  It was North Florida 1920 and 30's.   The census was done in
   1930.

    Most of His brothers ARE racists but my husband is not.  Now talk
   about some real hatred  even among family.....  Reminds me of Strom
   Thurmond...  They don't know by the way as far as we know.. we don't
   communicate.

   in SW Missouri when the first black family moved in across the street
   from us. After they were settled a truck shows up from a lumber yard
   and offloads a pallet of cinder blocks in front of their house and the
   father starts hauling them around to the back. My dad was working on
   his car in the front drive and we went over to help. Turns out "Rudy"
   was building a Bar-B-Que pit in his back yard. Dad forgot about the car
   and spent the day mixing bags of concrete, drinking Hamm's beer and
   laying blocks with Rudy. Best investment of labor ever - I still eat
   Rudys' sons' and daughters' 'Que every year at the county fair. Heard
   my first Sam Cooke record and learned to dance in their living room.

   A few weeks later (or so) the next door neighbor is out front scraping
   paint on his house. I asked what color he was going to paint it and he
   sez "Black! What other color is there?"

   I told my dad about it and he said "There's only two kinds of people in
   this world, son, those that work for a livin' and those that don't."

   Growing up where he did, my dad could have just as easy been the
   asshole neighbor. I thank providence for whatever circumstance(s) led
   to his becoming the man he was....

 Young, poor inner city blacks use the N word as ([1520]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1521]Ian Reifowitz

   a term of endearment, of bonding and friendship. Some well educated
   blacks who are professionals will use the N word, but only if they are
   in the company of young inner city blacks - so they don't seem like the
   stuffy, rich old farts. The only whites that can use the N word are
   whites who grew up in the exact same circumstances, but only in the
   company of their close black friends. Using the word is as much of a
   class issue as it is generational. Oprah and Chris Carter may have
   their hearts in the right place, but they may not be able to identify
   any longer with their poor inner city brothers and sisters.

   Every single individual member of the African diaspora gets to make

   Not that 3500 is anything less than sickening, but I"d call it a
   conservative estimate, even if the period is only from 1882 forward.
   Unless by "lynching" they're limiting the killings to only actual
   rope-and-tree hangings.  Doesn't seem to me like it should matter what
   the actual means are, killing is killing.  But if you included all the
   shootings, stabbings, bombings, hit-and-runs, fatal beatings and all
   the other brutal ways we can think of to kill each other, then 3500
   sounds like they're lowballing.

   Words change in meaning over time and thus the same

   are they 80 or 18?
   I worked for some 14 years in a factory with a diverse employee
   population and in the diverse atmosphere I heard every slur=word,
   racial=ephitat and ethnic insult that is in our American version of

   got angry with each other and then the names flew, rarely fist and when
   it was over,  it was over.   No one quit their job over it and others
   would laugh at them both.
