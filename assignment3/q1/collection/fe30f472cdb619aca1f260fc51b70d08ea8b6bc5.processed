Seeing Ghana's Health Care System in Action

     During my visit, I was very impressed by the information tracking in
     Ghana's health care system. It's enabling health care workers to
     closely measure their progress in delivering immunizations and other
     patient services. And it's helping Ghana make progress toward the
     Millennium Development Goals.

   I got to spend two days in Ghana this week. It was my first visit
   there, and the time was really productive and inspiring. I got to watch
   an effective health system in action - from the decision makers at the
   national level to nurses who live and work in the villages.

   I had heard that Ghana's health system thrived on tracking information
   but I didn't realize until I got there that it has an entire culture of
   data. Every immunization is carefully documented in the mother's green
   booklet that tracks the health care of each child, as well as recorded
   in large registry books. That data moves up the chain to the
   sub-district and district levels. This kind of rigor may sound obvious,
   but in many places I've traveled, recordkeeping is so erratic that
   health workers don't know how many babies live in their area of
   service, much less whether they've had all of their shots.

   I met Patricia Antwi, district director of health services in Awutu
   Senya, about an hour's drive north of Accra. Every month she gathers
   all of the sub-district heads to validate and pressure test their data
   with each other. Then every quarter all of the district leaders in her
   region meet and do the same. They track their work and adjust their
   planning and decision making based on such data as patient visits,
   products delivered and used, and immunization coverage rates. They
   openly debate what they have measured to help each other improve. They
   admit when it doesn't go as well as it should.

   Many of us are looking at potential digital strategies for
   record-keeping, but paper is pretty good.

   The energy and commitment of the well-trained nurses was obvious. Alice
   Grant Yamoah runs the community health compound in the village of
   Ahentia. She lives in the heart of the community with three
   colleagues. A couple of days a week they go out in to the villages to
   treat or immunize children when their mothers don't bring them
   in. Alice showed me how to give six-week-old Fredrick his rotavirus
   vaccine. Luckily for Fredrick these are drops that are fairly easy to
   administer. Still, both Fredrick and his mother were patient with
   someone doing it who clearly was less experienced than Alice and her
   colleagues.

   There is a lot to learn from Ghana's successes - but the most important
   in my mind is that countries need to have a really strong primary
   health care system that includes immunization as well as maternal and
   child health, malaria treatment and prevention, and other things that
   protect children and their families. It was a strong reminder to me
   that health is the magic lever. If you make progress there, it will
   help with all other things.

   I'm a huge believer in the Millennium Development Goals, and I was also
   struck in Ghana over how important they are in helping drive focus and
   progress in the right places and in the right ways.

   After visiting the clinics, I had the opportunity to meet with
   President John Dramani Mahama, who came into office in January. I was
   impressed by his strong focus on the MDGs. President Mahama and his
   ministers have a clear sense for where there has been great progress
   and where they still need to drive improvement.

   The MDGs have really helped Ghana's leaders focus their efforts,
   develop effective plans and measure their progress. Mahama was very
   clear about the good strides they have made in hunger and poverty as
   well as child mortality and education. He was equally candid about
   where they must redouble efforts to hit their targets in the areas of
   maternal health and sanitation. They still have a ways to go, but
   what's exciting is that they have a strong direction and a solid plan
   to accelerate progress.

What I'm Learning about Ghana

   I'm visiting Ghana to see firsthand why the country's immunization
   system is working so well and meet the people involved.
