     * [221]All Politics: Walker makes his case before Illinois Chamber of
       Commerce
     * [222]Walker returns $170,000 to business group's PAC

   Springfield, Ill. - Gov. Scott Walker came to the capital city of
   Illinois on Tuesday to make the case that he should be retained as
   Wisconsin's chief executive.

   He told the Illinois Chamber of Commerce that Wisconsin made the tough
   decisions to close its budget deficit, while Illinois continued to be
   burdened by an $8.5 billion deficit despite a 66% increase in the
   personal income tax rate.

   "The simple reality is, Illinois and Wisconsin, like nearly every other
   state, had big deficits to deal with. In our case, it was a $3.6
   billion deficit. . . . And we looked around, other states are going to
   make poor decisions, we want to avoid that in Wisconsin," Walker said.

   "We avoided a tax increase," he said, recalling how after Illinois
   passed its increase, he came to Chicago with a bumper sticker that
   read, "Escape to Wisconsin."

   "When you raise taxes on individuals, on businesses, that wealth,
   opportunity and jobs go somewhere else," he said.

   Walker was greeted with three standing ovations from the crowd of 250
   business leaders assembled at the President Abraham Lincoln Hotel and
   Conference Center.

   Meanwhile, outside the hotel, several thousand union protesters
   demonstrated against Walker's appearance. Wisconsin's governor has
   drawn the ire of organized labor after he and the Republican-led
   Legislature curtailed collective bargaining for most public-sector
   workers.

   "I think it's an abomination our chamber would bring Scott Walker to
   Illinois," said Melanie Hoyle, a member of AFSCME. "He has
   single-handedly tried to destroy the middle class."

   Walker was unflappable. He spoke without notes for his 30-minute
   address, answered questions from the audience and then met with about
   50 members of the media.

   Walker told the media that he had a great deal of respect for Illinois
   Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, but he quickly added that voters in
   Wisconsin have a clear choice in the June 5 recall.

   "People need to understand going backward is not just going backward in
   time in Wisconsin's case to the days when we had double-digit tax
   increases and billion-dollar budget deficits and record job loss, we
   can see what's happening right here in Illinois," Walker said.

   "You've got probably well-intentioned people. But the reality is you've
   had a dramatic increase in taxes on individuals and on business and
   that brought about even bigger problems the year after. The
   unemployment rate is above 9% (in Illinois).

   "In our state, we went the opposite direction, we put more of an
   emphasis on helping taxpayers and helping employers in our state. For
   the first time since 2008, our unemployment rate is below 7%."

   He also said Wisconsin has a better budget rating than Illinois,
   avoided massive layoffs, has a sound pension system and didn't cut
   Medicaid. Illinois is contemplating layoffs and Medicaid cuts and faces
   a pension shortfall of more than $80 billion for teachers and other
   public employees.

   "If voters in our state want to know the difference between going
   forward of backward, they need only look at the mess that you have in
   state government here in Springfield to know what it would be like if
   the recall ultimately prevailed," Walker said.

   Quinn said his state doesn't want to emulate Walker's policies.

   "Well, they had some tough times up there since he got elected
   governor," Quinn said at a news conference to announce that Paris-based
   Lafarge will move its North American headquarters to Illinois.

   "They have the worst job record in the whole country, dead last. And we
   certainly don't want to follow his prescriptions when it comes to
   economic growth," Quinn said. "He promised 250,000 jobs, and he's way
   behind. Since the recovery began, our state has created over 130,000
   jobs."

   During the speech, Walker joked a bit with the crowd about the
   differences between the two states.

   "We've got the Packers, you've got the Bears. What could bring us
   together? The Vikings," Walker said, drawing a laugh.

   Walker discussed the recall, saying "a handful of big-government union
   bosses" think he is standing in the way of their power.

   "We gave the vast majority of public employees in our state the freedom
   to choose," he said, referring to union dues.

   "I think on June 5, you're going to ultimately see that when we
   prevail," it will send a powerful message to state capitals across the
   Midwest and ultimately to Congress.

   He said the trip to Illinois showed the fundamental difference of what
   is going on in Wisconsin and Illinois.

   "I have a number of candidates, two of whom yesterday (Monday) said
   they embraced tax increases," Walker said of Democratic rivals Tom
   Barrett, the Milwaukee mayor, and Kathleen Falk, the former Dane County
   executive.

   "If people want to see what it would be like the way that Kathleen Falk
   and Tom Barrett are proposing tax increases on businesses and
   individuals, that's what happened here in Illinois," Walker added.

   Scot Ross, a Falk campaign spokesman, said that as Dane County
   executive, Falk balanced 14 straight budgets and the county led the
   state in job growth.

   "Compare that with Governor Walker's failed agenda in which Wisconsin
   had the highest job loss of any state in 2011 and tearing Wisconsin
   apart, and it's why Kathleen is the best candidate to face him."

   Phil Walzak, a spokesman for Barrett, said: "Governor Walker forgot to
   mention he raised fees $110 million and that his economy lost more jobs
   than any other state in the nation last year. No wonder he had to find
   a new audience in Illinois."

   The audience appeared to be galvanized by Walker's message.

   Skip Trotter, a business owner from Rockford, was impressed by Walker's
   "refreshing approach" to "set the future not for your next election but
   for the next generation."

   State Sen. Bill Brady said, "Clearly the changes have worked in
   Wisconsin, and they're the same changes that could work in Illinois."

   Doug Whitley, president and CEO of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce,
   said inviting Walker was designed to contrast the approaches taken by
   governments in Wisconsin and Illinois.

   "We need to be looking at best practices in other states," he said. "We
   want to embrace bold changes, and we quite frankly would like our
   elected officials to be more like Scott Walker, in the sense that we
   can't keep avoiding the difficult budgetary changes."

       This has just got to be driving the public sector union leaders
       nutz. Walker's ideas are like the ultimate cancer to their
       interests and they are now spreading beyond the borders of WI.

            A Nih....CAT is not going back to ILL. CAT has stopped its
            welding program with MATC until after the June election. If
            any of the Democrats that promised to rasie taxes on business
            and property. CAT will cancel its deal with MATC and move some
            operation to Indiana.

            No, they have already been moving positions down there and
            they are planning to send out the notices in August about the
            move. They are not waiting on the election. Trust me on this.

            Also Maxsale, you do realize some employees have already been
            allowed to apply for jobs in Rockford because they have been
            told the jobs are going anyways. I may be one of those hint
            hint.

       So Walker dropped collective bargaining, in the private sector if
       an employee steals from a customer, he is fired. If an employee
       harrasses another employee she is fired but in the public sector
       there are all these union rules that protects bad employees. Why
       protect bad workers?

       Did they thank Walker for making such a pit of disrepair that young
       kids are flocking to Ill by the hundreds? Or for making the state
       LAST in job creation so Illinois can prosper?

            Pit of disrepair. How so? Again, your rhetoric is stupid. The
            state isn't falling apart. Budgets have become more
            responsible in this state. It's o.k., you can pull up your big
            boy pants and admit the sky isn't falling in Wisconsin.

            Walker keeps tauting his job gains record. I can't beleive
            anything Walker says he is a hypocrite.

       Tax payers of Ill wish they had a strong leader like Walker. They
       know that their Governor is running their state into a hole so deep
       they will never get out.

            If he claims to hate them and is supposed to be decimating
            their state economically, why would that welcome Walker in
            open arms? Ever think they don't see him as a threat because
            he has no clue what he's doing in Wisconsin and Illinois is
            creating jobs hand over fist?

            Don't you have anything better to do than spread
            misinformation? You're probably still upset over the polls

            I'm not upset, I'm pointing at facts. Walker has deemed
            Illinois the Great Satan since taking office and claiming he
            will steal all their businesses, yet we are LAST in job
            creation and many places have been relocating south of the
            border despite our fancy new Open for Business signs. And with
            CAT moving it will crush So. Mil.

            Soon Illinois will see we have a governor like their former
            governor Ryan who ended up in federal prison just where Walker
            will be within a year.

            Walker wishes he could attract the high tech, high paying jobs
            Illinois has. As long as we have Walker we will never attract
            thoses type of jobs. Business leaders look for similiar types
            when looking to the Governor of a respective state they might
            move to. Business leaders are shocked that Walekr has no
            college degree, has never worked in the private sector.....no
            wonder they aren't moving here. Any state that would elect a
            guy that kicked out of college does not inspire confidence in
            business executives!

       250 hand picked "business leaders" - like the attendees at the WMC
       Business day are not necessarily representative of middle class
       interests.
       The "small government" label is a total misnomer - the regulations
       on women's health and rights, the voter ID, the sex ed rules, - all
       additional government regulations on the private sector
       (non-business, of course).
       If Scott Walker were serious about not losing the recall, he needed
       to talk directly to "das Volk" - the citizens of Wisconsin - a long
       time ago and hold a real discussion about how best to move the
       State forward. His steady monologue, delivered mostly out of state,
       with no dialogue, discussion or rebuttal does not build a base for
       any election success.
       Let's see, last week he was in Oklahoma telling their legislators
       how to run that state, then on to the NRA convention in Missouri
       and today in Illinois at a business meeting - and this is the
       Governor of the State of Wisconsin? Shouldn't he be in Madison a
       little more often?

            sara...go read the bill you're talking about. You'll see
            nothing has changed and that those rules are still covered
            under federal law. No need to have redundancy. That only cost
            more money, money that doesn't need to be spent. Its called
            being responsible with the money.

            Max no sale. You HAVE to be working for someone to be in here
            day and night. Fess up, dude.
            Your dismissive response to saravt is not accurate. You can't
            pretend that changes weren't made. You can't keep denying that
            his agenda hasn't been anti-women, for example. You look
            through distorted lenses at what has gone on. That's not
            surprising or going to change, but don't insult other people
            by telling them what they've seen hasn't happened.

            Very well expressed, saravt. Walker has avoided discussion
            since he was installed. He refused to discuss or negotiate
            with public employees. He has not shown any ability to sit
            down and have a dialogue with state employees, or the average
            Wisconsin citizen for that matter.From the outset, his
            speeches are given only to captive audiences which share his
            distorted views. Scott Walker is not a man of the people. He
            seems ill at ease with people. Even when the debates were held
            with Barrett, you could see his inability to engage in eye
            contact . He appeared nervous and deceptive. Reminded me of
            the old Tricky Dick video I've seen.
            He really does nothing but travel around speak to people of
            the same ilk, like ALEC groups, Chamber of Commerce, FOX TV,
            etc. He's totally isolated from the average Wisconsin citizen
            and seems to care less about them. The bottom line is that he
            has made NO effort to try to change this image or to make
            himself appear interested in mending ANY fences. From the
            outset, he was determined to go it alone with the backing of
            wealthy businessman. Ok, Scottie, you went it alone. You made
            your choices and you have no one to blame but yourself for the
            current upheaval.

            Walker was hand picked to talk to this group because of the
            successful business climate in Wisconsin because of his hard
            work and policy!
            Illinois is a night/day contrast to how Wisconsin is being
            governed. They want to know why our state is thriving and
            theirs is still suffering with major cuts and 9%
            unemployment!!
            Walker's policies and reforms are working, Quin's tax hikes
            are running work out of the state and not working!

            saravt, your friends in the Democrat party have taken the
            political stage in Wisconsin and spread it to the nation.
            Obama's people have helped. And now you want to complain that
            he is speaking around the country. That is like the farmer
            opening the gate and then complaining that the cows got out.
            Is your name really sara? Or maybe Notso? Is that you Mrs.
            Bright?
            You need to stop listening to the rants and start to think for
            yourself. You are being snowed.

            Balanced the budget
            Destroyed collective bargaining
            Made public employees pay a bit for their lavish benefits and
            lavish pensions
            Kept class sizes the same
            Allowed school districts to save millions of dollars by
            choosing their own benefit provider
            Passed concealed carry
            Reduced property taxes

       A NIH.....I work a CAT a few times each month and have two
       employees from CAT that live on my street. One is a welder they
       other is the CFO. The welder tells me all thats going on and the
       CFO keeps most of whats going on in the company to himself but he
       does talk a little about the inner workings. If a Democrat is
       elected governor, CAT will move some operation to Indiana and
       cancell its program for welders with MATC.

            Yeah, Max should be exposed for the bald face liar that he is.
            You can see the lengths he will go to to try and dismiss a
            point someone is making. I'm sure he is nothing but a paid
            stooge. Strong accusation, but after observing him intently
            lately what other conclusion can any reasonable person draw?

            Maxsale: for your information the CFO of CAT does not even
            live in Wisconsin. CAT is an Illinois Company. Headquartered
            in Illinois with plants all over the world including So. Milw
            Wisc.and the program with MATC is based solely on the
            availability of qualified applicants with certain quotas which

            Correct BUYER. Max is just trying to concoct lies to try and
            claim Walker did nothing wrong when CAT leaves. Note how he
            claims a welding program hinges on an election and they are
            moving to Indiana. Keep dreaming. It's set for Illinois. On
            the plus side, Rockford is still somewhat commutable.

            Go away and do what? Run our government like Illinois? That's
            working so well for them! Grow up, more people support Walker
            than not. Times have changed and this is the only way our
            state and country will survive!!

            Actually job growth in Illinois is a little bit better than
            ours. No big deal you might say? At least the flatlanders are
            doing it without crippling the future by gouging the middle
            class or education.

            Really how is it a little bit better? Maybe by sheer numbers
            because the state is bigger than Wisconsin. Unemployment rate
            is the only fair stat to compare two very different states and
            Illinois is at 9% and wisconsin stands at 6.9%.
            Stop drinking the koolaide. Wisconsin is in way better shape
            than Illinois is. The facts prove it!
