   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Michael Green: North Korea more threatening than usual; three
       scenarios may play out
     * 1. Nuke threats grow; regime will get U.S. to lift sanctions;
       regime returns to same tactics
     * 2. China will turn on North, cut it off; Kim will lose power; North
       and South reunite sans nukes
     * 3. Kim will fire on South; U.S. will get involved; North will fall;
       Japan, South Korea ravaged

   Editor's note: Associate Professor Michael Green is senior vice
   president for the Asia and Japan Chair at the[42] Center for Strategic
   and International Studies at Georgetown University. He served as
   special assistant to the president and senior director for Asia on the
   National Security Council staff during George W. Bush's administration.

   (CNN) -- Hyperbolic North Korean threats of war are not new. What is
   new is the intensity and persistence of those threats this time around.

   Add to that an untested 29-year-old leader who is suddenly a four-star
   general with lots to prove. How does this end? Consider these three
   possibilities:

   1. What Kim Jong Un hopes: North Korean threats continue to escalate.
   Pyongyang renews earlier threats to transfer its "nuclear deterrent
   capability" to third parties in the Middle East and declares South
   Korean waters west of the peninsula an open fire zone.

   The South Korean stock market plummets. Chinese leaders begin to panic
   about instability on their border. Washington is desperate to set aside
   the North Korea problem while dealing with a parallel crisis in Iran.
   The North proposes negotiations on a peace treaty formally ending the
   Korean War, but only if international sanctions imposed on the regime
   after their previous nuclear and missile tests are suspended.
   Michael J. Green
   Michael J. Green

   Washington, Seoul and Tokyo reluctantly agree to the North's terms to
   avoid further escalation. Meanwhile, the North continues miniaturizing
   uranium-based nuclear weapons in underground facilities.

   One year later, they test a more sophisticated warhead design and
   improved missiles payload. The North then demands the end of remaining
   international sanctions, recognition as a legitimate nuclear weapons
   state and a summit meeting in Pyongyang between Kim and President
   Barack Obama.

   To back up its threat, the North shells several South Korean islands
   and threatens to use its newly enhanced nuclear capability if the South
   retaliates. The crisis resumes, but with the North more dangerous.

   This has more or less been the pattern thus far.

   2. What Washington, Seoul and Tokyo hope: Kim's unpredictability
   finally turns the North's erstwhile ally, China, firmly against the
   regime.

   Intensifying U.S.-Japan-South Korean defense cooperation demonstrates
   how North Korean actions are isolating China within the region. Beijing
   vows to step up pressure on the regime and stops all inbound North
   Korean ships and planes for inspections based on U.N. Security Council
   resolutions.

   When Kim tries to escalate again, Beijing cuts oil shipments to the
   North by 50% (China's food and fuel shipments keep the small North
   Korean economy afloat).

   The North agrees to a moratorium on testing of missiles and nuclear
   weapons and to resume earlier negotiations on denuclearization. Those
   talks move at a glacial pace because the North sees nuclear weapons as
   its only means of regime survival. But Kim's obvious mismanagement of
   the confrontation has discredited him in front of his generals.

   Fissures open, and the regime begins slowly to unravel. Careful U.S.
   and South Korean coordination with China throughout the crisis lays the
   basis for a managed unification of the peninsula, removal of the
   North's nuclear and WMD arsenal, and freedom for millions of North
   Koreans.

   3. What everyone fears most: Kim's escalation strategy fails to cause
   the other powers to recognize the North as a legitimate nuclear weapons
   state or to ease sanctions.

   The young leader and his advisers continue searching for threats that
   will terrify the South and cause China to provide further bribes for
   good behavior, but without provoking a massive U.S. attack on the
   North. The exuberant but inexperienced Kim approves live artillery fire
   on uninhabited mountains just outside the South Korean capital of
   Seoul.

   The South responds with limited counterbattery fire against the North
   Korean artillery units.

   DOD: Missile defense radar in Pacific
   Is N. Korea a nuclear threat or not?

   [46]Opinion: Does N. Korea think U.S. is soft?

   Aware that it cannot surrender or win, the North opens broader and
   deadlier artillery and missile broadsides against the South. Knowing
   that these forward deployed artillery and missile forces pose the
   greatest threat to the South if not taken out, U.S. and South Korean
   forces hammer North Korean emplacements north of the DMZ.

   The conflict ends with defeat of North Korean forces and decapitation
   of the North Korean leadership through massive airstrikes, but the
   damage to South Korea and Japan, which is within missile range, is
   appalling.

   How does this end?

   Right now we are somewhere between the first two scenarios -- and could
   remain ambiguously so for some time. The third scenario remains highly
   unlikely, though not impossible.

   The first scenario is tempting for some, because it would temporarily
   ease tensions, but in the long run it makes the third scenario more
   likely and much more lethal.

   That means that U.S. policy has to focus on realizing scenario two. The
   North's brazen actions make that more possible than ever. But it means
   not blinking.
