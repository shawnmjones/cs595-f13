   [29]depression
   Click image for all panels and text at Hyperbole and a Half

   It takes a patient, unfortunate, brave writer to let a reader in and
   then reveal the dark depths of clinical depression. It takes multimedia
   genius to make that reader howl along in laughter at what feel like
   very special inside jokes directed just at them. Via [30]Balloon Juice,
   here's a post that stands by itself in that elusive genre, from a
   blogger I only know as [31]Hyperbole and a Half:

     If someone ever asks me "what was the exact moment where things
     started to feel slightly less shitty?" instead of telling a nice,
     heartwarming story about the support of the people who loved and
     believed in me, I'm going to have to tell them about the piece of
     corn. And then I'm going to have to try to explain that no, really,
     it was funny. Because, see, the way the corn was sitting on the
     floor... it was so alone... and it was just sitting there! And no
     matter how I explain it, I'll get the same, confused look.

   If you have depression or have ever dealt with it in a loved one, give
   that a whirl. It may not help, you may not get it, but some of you will
   feel the proverbial diamond bullet through the forehead.

     * [32]This is indeed a mystery. In my line of work, I know for a fact
       there are conservatives doing great science, they do it quietly and
       without much fanfare or encouragement like any other scientist. But
       in [33]visible case after [34]visible case, they seem [35]to
       struggle with the most basic concepts.
     * I once got in a heated argument with a stranger at a 7-11 over the
       price of gas. I was trying to point out that that gallon of gas
       probably started out as [36]Carboniferous sludge 300 million years
       ago in present day [37]Ghawar, had to be pumped out and floated
       halfway around the world, precariously refined and delivered by
       truck, and it still cost way less per unit volume than the
       purported domestic spring water she had in hand. Of course like so
       many items we buy, including gasoline, that purported spring water
       comes at a [38]steep hidden price foisted off on other consumers.
     * There are plenty of inconsistencies between modern natural science
       and religious texts. But listen up fundies, the Big Bang is [39]not
       one of them. They should be embracing that bit of cosmology,
       because a [40]steady-state universe, one without a beginning, does
       not need to be created.
     * Tesla Motors [41]posts a profit, stock surges! Whichever electric
       car makers succeed, in a decade the usual suspects will be bragging
       about how they believed in the company's genius and vision from day
       one. The Motley Fool [42]has more (reg'n required).
     * How could whiskey, prescription drugs, Russians, wingnut
       propaganda, and space travel all converge in about one thousand
       words? You'll have to wait until Sunday Kos to find out if I can
       tie that all together with a neat little bow. But in the words of
       the Little Engine that Could, I think I can ...

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [55]Tagging tips - [56]Search For Tags - [57]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       never been there before.
       Her (I had no clue it was a she until just now) description of the
       depression process is the best I've ever seen. It's so hard to
       explain unless you've been there. For those of us that have been
       there, her words and pictures are simply and eloquently perfect.

 Douglas Adams' character Marvin ([171]4+ / 0-)

       the Paranoid Android, in the Hitchhiker series--Adams originally
       planned him as a one-off joke, a depressed robot, haha, but he
       proved so popular with fans that Adams made Marvin into a major
       character.

     "Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where
     I'm standing?"

     "Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only companions."
     Pardon me for breathing, which I never do any way so I don't know
     why I bother to say it, oh God, I'm so depressed. I'm not getting
     you down at all, am I?
       And God said, "Let there be light"; and with a Big Bang, there was
       light. And God said "Ow! Ow My eyes!" and in a flash God separated
       light from darkness. "Whew! Now that's better. Now where was I. Oh
       yea . . ."

   but the Big Bang Theory says yes, the existing universe has a starting
   point, but it DOES NOT say that something came from nothing. It says
   simply that at one time all matter was a part of singularity.  It
   doesn't say how that singularity was created.

   In fact, Hawking has argued that in fact the matter in the universe had
   no beginning, and noted he would be in trouble with John Paul for
   inquiring about the state of matter before the big bang.

       not arguing it was created by a creator or anything else
       specifically, only that a steady state universe by definition
       wasn't. Primarily because the Big Bang has often finds itself
       wrapped up in fundie dogma about creationism as an exempler of
       evolution and other sciejtific theories from the "pit of hell" ...

       Inflationary theory disallows a singularity but implies a
       previously-existing space (of whatever configuration as it doesn't
       much matter in the end).
       Classical Big Bang theories have the singularity, but are currently
       in disfavor in a lot of circles due to evidence that doesn't scan
       well.

   too far now.  The [257]Great Mimolette Mite war has begun.  Cheese
   mites are what make those tangy yummy rinds on aged cheeses like
   mimolette (an orange gouda type cheese), brie, camembert and others.

   They are removed for the most part with compressed air but some may
   remain.  FDA in only allowing 6 per square inch.  Ridiculous if you
   read the regs on how many roach parts, rodent hair and other icky
   things are allowed in processed foods.  We all eat stuff with living
   things in it because we need them for a healthy gut.  What's a few
   mites when one loves a good cheese.

   I've loved Hyperbole And A Half for years and have laughed hysterically

   brilliant. It's the first time I've ever seen anyone capture what
   depression actually is and is like. I hope that many depression

   Life is much better for me these days -- even with all of the upheaval
   caused by the wonderful economy in which we live.

   I could almost be described as irrationally optimistic these days, but
   I still cringe every time I turn to somebody who I care about and who
   should care about me and am told, "It's not that bad. Heck... I know
   lots of people who are going through that."

   It's not bad to end up there after a nice talk, but how does anybody
   think "Your puny little problems don't interest me" is a helpful
   conversation starter?

       not a therapist and I don't play one on the Internet. BUT -- I've
       asked around a lot, loved ones have gone through it, I've seen it
       up close ... I've been told by experts there's not much you can say
       that will help when someone is in that state. That it can be risky
       to try and deal with it on your own even if you have training. And
       that you definitely don't want to get too involved unless it's
       someone you truly care about beyond telling someone who truly cares
       about that person.

   ...that it simply doesn't matter that you are not alone.  The problems
   are, by their very nature, isolating.  When you're depressed like that,
   you do become an island unto yourself.  People that try to drag you
   back to land just make it worse.  People that stand with you - even
   silently - on your own island, do eventually get through.  But it is
   painful and tricky and it doesn't always work.

   As DarkSyde said, it's risky to try and deal with depression,
   especially clinical depression, on your own.  It's a black hole with no
   bottom.  Frank Herbert once said, in his book Dune that "fear is the
   little death."

   Depression is too, and far more so.

   based on experience with my daughter - the "I want to kill myself" is
   sometimes a plea to "please get me out of this situation and let me
   start over".

   My ex and I put our heads together and made the decision to move my
   daughter in with him so that she would go to an entirely different
   school.  (This was 10 years ago).  The change was dramatic - she was
   like a new person.  It was a difficult decision - but sometimes we as
   adults need to step in and make the tough decisions and not leave the
   kid to somehow fix it themselves.  All the talk and counceling won't
   change the environment and kids can get caught up in things that are
   very difficult to extract themselves from - due to peer pressure and
   peer conformity.  My daughter still has depression but is quite
   successful in her chosen field and I don't doubt that it had a lot to
   do with that difficult decision we made so many years ago.

       don't want to die, but if I think death is inevitable, at least I
       can go out on my own terms."
       From a suicide survivor, you don't think all those words, but it
       can be the root of the problem.  Pulling your kid out of that
       corner was the smartest thing you possibly could have done, and
       quite probably saved her life.

   it makes so much sense, and it illustrates it so well.  My kids are
   both going through teen depressive phases.  I went through it too.  I
   clearly remember the 'I don't want to kill myself, I just want to be
   dead' part.  But I never told anyone.  Now 40 years later I'm on
   antidepressants for menopause and suddenly I'm stable and happy for the
   first time in my life.

   Corn is hilarious!  Hang in there and keep it up, or as this message
   might sound to a depressed person, 'blah, blah, blah, why can't you
   just decide to be happy'.

   For me, I never wanted to kill myself but I think I wanted people
   notice how bad things were for me and whether they would notice I was
   gone , or care.   I can also remember the pinnacle of the 'dead fish'
   part of it. I produced a concert at college with two of my favorite
   bands, sold out show, totally awesome, friends hangout afterward having
   pizza, and i felt nothing, despite that day being everything I thought
   I wanted at the time.

   Medication proved useful in getting me to articulate a troubled
   childhood and together the meds and talking it out changed my life in
   big way.

   I have been wistfully checking in on Allie Brosh every once in a while

   because she was supposed to be publishing a book last year.

   Her blog about her depression is one of the most brilliant things I've
   ever read and as someone who has dealt with clinical depression off and
   on since childhood, it's so comforting when you see that others
   actually GET it.

   I would have missed it if not for your link. Have I thanked you lately?
