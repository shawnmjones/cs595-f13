[22]Senate Judiciary Committee approves immigration reform on 13-5 vote

   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT)
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat Leahy
   Immigration reform moves forward to [29]the next phase:

     The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday approved a broad overhaul
     of the nation's immigration laws on a bipartisan vote, sending the
     most significant immigration policy changes in decades to the full
     Senate, where the debate is expected to begin next month.

   The bipartisan vote came after committee chairman Pat Leahy [30]dropped
   his push for an amendment that would have offered protection for
   same-sex couples. Sen. Orrin Hatch added his support after forging an
   agreement to allow companies to hire more non-American workers by
   raising the minimum number of H-1B visas and lowering their burden to
   show that they tried to hire an American before looking overseas.

   Notably, Hatch's support was limited to the committee vote:

     By late afternoon on Tuesday, Mr. Hatch had said that he would
     support the bill out of committee, if not necessarily on the Senate
     floor, after the committee agreed, via a voice vote, to pass his
     amendment.

     "I'm going to vote this bill out of committee because I've committed
     to do that," Mr. Hatch said.

   That suggests that he hopes to introduce more changes to the
   legislation when floor debate begins next month. Still, committee
   senators sought his support, hoping that the overwhelming bipartisan
   vote would give the overall bill momentum as it heads to the full
   senate.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   There's not any reason why we need more H1B's other than the greed of
   the IT contracting industry and their customers. Rather than bringing
   in more and more foreign workers we should be supporting IT job
   training if there truly is a shortage of IT workers in this country.

       Give me 100,000 people a year from the farms of India and garment
       districts of Pakistan and the factories of Indonesia, and let them
       train here if we need more IT workers.  Let them come on a normal,
       standard "green card", that allows them to pick their career and
       allows them to shop their labor freely.
       Right now, H1-B Visas are just a class filter to make sure on the
       scum who are just fine with forcing 30-50% of any given population
       into poverty are getting into this country.
       We've got enough of those people.

       IT workers are not part of the wealthy.  the wealthy folks are the
       ones who own the companies where the IT people work.
       You would be surprised at how little these people earn, how much
       salaries have already flattened and sunk.
       I'm shocked you would cheer for financial misfortune to fall on
       middle class workers.

 Oh yeah, spoiled ([130]0+ / 0-)
       I work every day right now with Indian IT staff from a partner
       company.  They are in Bangalore.  They work 12 hours a day,
       routinely working until midnight.  They are configuring a
       datacenter in Europe that uses my company's products.  That is the
       reality of international competition.  They are not "spoiled".
       They go to work past people defecating on the side of the road in
       110 degree heat.  They are motivated.

 Facts? ([134]0+ / 0-)
       Show me a good programmer on an H1B who is being abused, and I'll
       show you a programmer who will be recruited into another US company
       who will be more than glad to sponsor the H1B.  Right now, at
       least, there is a shortage of qualified programmers and IT
       personnel.
       We have 20 sys admins where I work.  25% of the IT staff hired do
       not cut it.  They don't get stuff done.  They miss deadlines.  They
       show no interest in their jobs.  The do not reach out and problem
       solve.  Or, they are just not that bright and can't do the work.
       Anyone, regardless of ethnicity, immigration status, age, sex,
       whatever who can do the job is extremely valued.
       Sorry, it is a very competitive world.  We need to make places for
       the people who can't do high-tech jobs.    Not everyone can be a
       good high-tech worker.
       The people I feel little sympathy for are the college graduates who
       did not prepare themselves to earn money, and now are shocked
       because they are not employable.

       "... with IT degrees from developing nations"
       I'm not looking up his posting history but in this case you are
       clearly wrong. JesseCW is obviously talking about rich, spoiled,
       Indians coming over here and taking our IT jobs. My experience with
       Indian IT workers is similar to his although certainly not all of
       the Indians I've worked with are spoiled and "rich" in India means
       something very different than it does here.
       My experience is that these Indian workers are not any smarter or
       have any greater work ethic than US workers.

 You've got that pretty inverted. ([167]0+ / 0-)

   Although it's true that I generally hold people who's mumsy and poppsy
   paid their way through school in pretty low regard, it's got nothing to
   do with any specific grudge against US trained IT workers in the
   specific.

   The biggest assholes being brought into the country through H1-B Visas
   tend to be engineers, doctors, and pharmacists - but poor people from
   extremely economically depressed countries don't get IT degrees.

   Maybe I'm missing all those applicants from the favelas and amchi wasti
   of the world, but none of those I ever met came from them.

   This is a way to set an immigration policy the economically
   discriminates against the poor, and it's shit.

 They're struggling to pay off student loans. ([203]0+ / 0-)

   Do you think most of those coming over on H1-B Visas for IT work are?

   Do you understand that this is a part of what drives wages down?  They
   don't have to pay off the cost of a US education.  They can't unionize,
   because if they lose their job they get deported.  They can't even
   negotiate for raises, really, because they have no bargaining position.

   I've actually seen a pharmacist on H1-B Visa laugh out loud at an
   American Pharmacist who was talking about his 1,700 dollar a month
   student loan payment.  He said, flatly, "This why it is a waste to put
   the poor in Universities.  We don't give them that kind of false hope.
    If you needed to borrow tuition money, you didn't belong there".

   That's not the kind of immigrants we need to build a nation with
   compassion.

   It's not an encouraging sign that we had to give up what we wanted
   (protection for same-sex couples), while the Republicans got what they
   wanted (weakening the restrictions on H-1B visas in ways that are
   harmful to workers).

   It's downright discouraging that Senator Hatch got the changes he
   wanted without even agreeing to vote for this thing on the senate
   floor.  I have a nasty feeling that by the time this actually gets to a
   vote in the Senate, it will be much, much worse -- expanded guest
   worker programs, even fewer restrictions on H-1B visas, and the path
   for citizenship turned into a labyrinth.

   Needless to say, I hope I'm wrong.

   I think "path" should always be put in quotes because, as you noted,
   it's a labyrinthine 13-year process involving penalties and fees and an
   inability to access earned benefits.  I don't get why we've all agreed
   that 13 years is fair; to me, it seems unnecessarily punitive.

   It's also annoying to see how self-congratulatory pols and journos tend
   to be on this.   The Dems early on acted as though they had already
   "won" just by the fact that immigration was being discussed---that's an
   easy way to allow the debate to glide to the right.

       Not like this crap bill will pass the House.
       So no point in getting all worked up over it.
       However, the minute it goes down in flames you can be certain that
       it will be used as a cudgel to beat the living shit out of the GOP
       among the Latino community.  If you get them fired up and get them
       to turn out even slightly higher than normal then you put many more
       districts in play that would not necessarily be in play in off year
       elections.
       If the Dems flip 17 seats and hold the Senate, reform the
       filibuster rules then you can be sure that a better plan will pass.

       If the Dems DON'T get the House in 2014, then they have a very
       potent issue in 2016 which will help them not only likely keep the
       presidency and maybe flip the House but also potentially flip many
       seats in the Senate and depending on the outcome of 2014 maybe even
       get above the 60 vote threshold imposed by the ratfucks in the GOP.

       This is all political.  So giving up some things like allowances
       for same sex couples in the Senate Bill is small potatoes if it
       means the Dems gain the House.  After that they can push a better
       bill with those allowances in and Orrin Hatch can then go fuck
       himself.

   such a betrayal, especially from Senators Schumer and Feinstein. It
   would have been so easy to call the GOP's bluff on this one instead of

   used time and again as a wedge in partisan politics, but for it to
   happen at this moment in time, when public opinion is so clearly moving
   in favor of legalizing same-sex unions, it's particularly
   disheartening. So now our fate is in the hands of the SCOTUS as they

       It's proved once again that Democratic support for LGBTs is a mile
       wide & an inch deep. They throw us under the bus every time when it
       matters most. They want us to vote for them & donate to their
       campaigns, & then after the election to just STFU already.
       Last time I checked, it was the REPUBLICANS who needed to move on
       the immigration issue. So why is it that the DEMOCRATS are the ones
       doing all the compromising & back-pedaling? Why not include the
       same-sex couples provision & dare Republicans to withdraw their
       support & then have explain to Latino voters that they had no
       choice but to block immigration reform because of the gays? After
       all, they are the ones who will pay the price if immigration reform
       fails.
       My fear was always that we would end up with a law that is heavy on
       enforcement while weak & provisional on a pathway citizenship or at
       least legal status for all the immigrants currently living in the
       shadows. That fear is closer to realization. Even worse, now we
       would end up with an immigration law that codifies rank
       discrimination. I read earlier today that the same-sex couples
       provision was withdrawn from consideration by the Judiciary
       Committee at the behest of President Obama. Apparently he just
       wants something he can slap a signature on, never mind the details.

   This "compromise" increases the number of H1-B visas and guest workers.
   It's a sharp knife between the shoulder blades for American workers.

   Every American kid who took on huge debts to get a college degree must
   now compete with low-priced foreign workers brought in to take their
   jobs. These young voters supported us by huge margins, and this is
   their payback?

   Every older tech worker who has paid their dues and amassed valuable
   experience may now be asked to train their replacement. On top of the
   economic pain is piled humiliation.  I know a Chinese-American woman
   who was made to train her replacement...a Chinese National. But the
   Corporations save money...

     We (Progressives) should oppose any measure that increases H1-B
     visas and/or guest workers.

   If Corporations think they need more "high skill" workers, let them
   raise their salaries. We should demand a Minimum Wage for guest
   workers. The wage should be high -- perhaps $175,000/yr -- to ensure
   that these "high skill" workers are truly needed.
