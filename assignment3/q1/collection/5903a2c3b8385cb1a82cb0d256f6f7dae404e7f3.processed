The PowerPoint That Proves It‚s Not Obama‚s Sequester After All

   by [24]John Avlon Feb 20, 2013 4:45 AM EST

Republicans have taken to calling the deep cuts that could reverse our
hard-won economic recovery ‚Obama‚s Sequester.‚ But a July 2011 PowerPoint
obtained by John Avlon shows the opposite may be true.

   With deep sequestration cuts just days away, Congress is on vacation.
   But they‚ve still got plenty of time to play the blame game.

   The latest semantic spin is to call the [27]looming $1.2 trillion in
   cuts, which could throw the whole economy back into recession, ‚Obama‚s
   Sequester.‚ House Speaker John Boehner indulged this approach half a
   dozen times in a [28]floor speech before he went on break, establishing
   its place in the talking-points firmament.

   There are a couple problems with this tactic, as my colleague
   [29]Michael Tomasky pointed out Tuesday. Congress passed sequestration
   before the president signed it, and the whole self-defeating exercise
   was carried out in response to Tea Party Republicans‚ insistence that
   we [30]play chicken with the debt ceiling, which ultimately cost
   America its AAA credit rating.

   But here‚s the thing. I happened to come across an old email that
   throws cold water on House Republicans‚ attempts to call this ‚Obama‚s
   Sequester.‚

   It‚s a PowerPoint presentation that Boehner‚s office developed with the
   Republican Policy Committee and sent out to the Capitol Hill GOP on
   July 31, 2011. Intended to explain the outline of the proposed debt
   deal, the presentation is titled: ‚Two Step Approach to Hold President
   Obama Accountable.‚

   It‚s essentially an internal sales document from the old dealmaker
   Boehner to his unruly and often unreasonable Tea Party cohort. But it‚s
   clear as day in the presentation that ‚sequestration‚ was considered a
   cudgel to guarantee a reduction in federal spending‚the conservatives‚
   necessary condition for not having America default on its obligations.

   The presentation lays out the deal in clear terms, describing the
   spending backstop as ‚automatic across-the-board cuts
   (‚sequestration‚). Same mechanism used in 1997 Balanced Budget
   Agreement.‚

   The Joint Committee, ultimately misled by Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-TX)
   and Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) into enacting the sequester, is explained
   in detail under a page titled ‚Entitlement Reforms and Savings‚:
   [31]130215-Avlon-Boehner-Sequester-embed

   A slide from the final page of Speaker John Boehner's Powerpoint to
   House Republicans on July 31st, 2011, obtained by The Daily Beast.

     * Sets up a new sequestration process to cut spending
       across-the-board‚and ensure that any debt limit increase is met
       with greater spending cuts‚IF Joint Committee fails to achieve at
       least $1.2T in deficit reduction.

     * If this happens, POTUS may request up to $1.2T for a debt limit
       increase, and if granted, then across-the-board spending cuts would
       result that would equal the difference between $1.2T and the
       deficit reduction enacted as a result of Joint Committee.

     * Across-the-board spending cuts would apply to FYs 2013-2021, and
       apply to both mandatory & discretionary programs.

     * Total reductions would be equally split between defense and
       non-defense programs. Across-the-board cuts would also apply to
       Medicare. Other programs, including Social Security, Medicaid,
       veterans, and civil & military pay, would be exempt.

     * Sequestration process is designed to guarantee that Congress acts
       on the Joint Committee‚s legislation to cut spending.

   And that‚s pretty much exactly what‚s scheduled to start happening on
   March 1. Democrats could just as easily spin this as ‚Boehner‚s
   Sequester‚ or ‚Cantor‚s Sequester‚ and offer indelible digital evidence
   to back up their claim.

   Boehner's office contests that characterization, arguing that the
   PowerPoint was simply Boehner‚s attempt to explain the president's plan
   to the Republican caucus. "This slide simply shows a description of the
   Budget Control Act after President Obama insisted on including his
   sequester," says Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.

   The supercommittee failed in large part because the Republican
   representatives couldn‚t agree on revenue increases from closing tax
   loopholes. After the presidential election, the two parties couldn‚t
   reason together to avoid the next self-imposed hurdle, the fiscal
   cliff, and instead passed a last-second patchwork that dealt with the
   tax rates that were scheduled to rise but left the sequester
   unaddressed because there was no time to hammer out a grand bargain.

   And so here we are again, days away from a new deadline, and a sensible
   grand bargain to deal with our long-term debt seems very far away.

   All of the bipartisan plans that have been compiled‚Bowles-Simpson,
   Gang of 6, Rivlin-Domenici‚follow the same basic balanced formula of
   targeted spending cuts, entitlement reforms, and revenue increases from
   closing tax loopholes. Everyone is going to have to give a little to
   pass a balanced plan in a divided government. The Obama-Boehner grand
   bargain that was negotiated in the summer of 2011 and came so close to
   being agreed upon increasingly looks like the best bet conservatives
   could get. But they pressured Boehner to walk away without so much as a
   returned phone call.

   Today we see some of the same hyperpartisan fantasies dominating the
   debate, the idea that waiting just one more election will allow one
   party to impose its will and avoid any concessions that could anger the
   base. So Republicans say the problem is only spending‚but then in the
   next breath decry the deep defense cuts that are scheduled to make up
   half the sequester and pass a bill that would simply exempt their given
   interests from pain. Liberal Democrats attack the Bowles-Simpson
   commission, which offered new details on Tuesday as an [32]alternative
   to sequestration, as a capitulation to Republican priorities and
   imagine they will retake the House in 2014.

   Like a junkie begging for just one more fix before they get straight,
   these politicos keep begging for one more election before they face
   facts. Math isn‚t partisan. Our current levels of debt are
   unsustainable. They can‚t be solved by simply cutting or taxing our way
   out of the hole.

   The hypocrisy runs deep. While a bipartisan plan like Bowles-Simpson
   gets paid plenty of lip service, when it came to a vote in the House,
   it went down to defeat, 382-38, with just 22 Democrats and 16
   Republicans voting for it. President Obama also deserves blame for not
   backing Bowles-Simpson when it was first proposed or aggressively
   pushing a lame duck grand bargain. And while the GOP has often
   responded to his outreach with the back of its hand, the president must
   rise above and lead. Obama‚s [33]call to pass a short-term $110 billion
   stopgap measure is better than the alternative meat-cleaver cuts,
   provided that it lays the groundwork for a real grand bargain.

   The sequester was designed to be so stupid and painful that it would
   compel the supercommittee‚or a lame-duck Congress‚to come up with a
   reasonable alternative. But it was apparently not painful enough to
   compel the two parties to work together, despite the shared goal of
   some $4 trillion in debt reduction. And now, faced with the pain that
   both parties voted for but nobody wants, they‚re busy pointing fingers
   and trying to assign political blame.

   Congress should come back from vacation and get back to work. There is
   no more time to waste. Washington is now the greatest impediment to
   America‚s hard-won economic recovery‚a situation that‚s equally
   pathetic and predictable.
