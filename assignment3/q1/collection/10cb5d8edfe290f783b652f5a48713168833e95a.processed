[24]With Gov. Pat McCrory in the audience, Colin Powell blasts North
Carolina's racist voter law

   Colin Powell
   A Republican who thinks North Carolina Republicans are making a big
   mistake.
   Former Secretary of State Colin Powell was the keynote speaker at the
   CEO Forum in Raleigh, North Carolina, Wednesday evening. After
   introductory remarks, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory left the stage to
   listen to the retired general from the audience. Last month, McCrory
   signed into law new voter restrictions that will make it harder for the
   poor, disabled, student and minority voters to cast ballots. He did not
   address the law in his remarks. Powell [30]said:

     "I want to see policies that encourage every American to vote, not
     make it more difficult to vote," said Powell, a Republican, at the
     CEO Forum in Raleigh.

     "It immediately turns off a voting block the Republican Party
     needs," Powell continued. "These kinds of actions do not build on
     the base. It just turns people away." [...]

     "You can say what you like, but there is no voter fraud," Powell
     said. "How can it be widespread and undetected?"

     Powell, who served under President George W. Bush, also said the new
     law sends the wrong message to minority voters. "What it really says
     to the minority voters is ... 'We really are sort-of punishing
     you,'" he said.

   Of course, McCrory, the Republican-dominated state legislature, and
   similarly minded legislatures elsewhere will blow off Powell's
   criticisms. Just as they have blown off the same criticisms from
   others. The goal is still to suppress enough votes to shave a few
   percentage points from the Democratic tally, enough in some races to
   throw the victory to Republican candidates. If they can get away with
   that, and the U.S. Supreme Court has made that effort easier with its
   Shelby decision, then they will continue to do so no matter what Powell
   and other highly placed critics have to say.

   [31]Please join Daily Kos by urging Congress to save the Voting Rights
   Act by creating a new preclearance formula.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [48]Tagging tips - [49]Search For Tags - [50]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Prominent Republicans who deliver "[384]Have you no decency, sir?"
   moments to other prominent Republicans interfere with ongoing RWNJ
   indoctrination of young folks who can think for themselves.

   RWNJs have to explain to their kids that the bad man is not a real
   Republican, because real Republicans don't say what the bad man said.
   Such bankruptcy of thought can be obvious even to adolescents, who
   through it may see their first glimpses of light from outside the
   paranoid bubble.

 So true blue means anyone with a D is cool? ([506]0+ / 0-)
       Ridiculous.
       The Republicans continue on a rightward trajectory in who is
       qualified to run for office as a Republican.
       The answer by Democrats should be to continue to stand up for the
       middle class and the common man -- not to follow the Republicans on
       their rightward rush, merely a few steps behind and absorbing and
       welcoming into the party anyone rejected by the Republicans.
       It would have far greater meaning to stopping this rightward rush
       if Powell ran as a Republican -- because it would directly counter
       the rightward movement of the party.
       Then you'd have Powell, probably governing very similarly to Obama
       as far as the political spectrum.
       In truth, neither is going to happen. The Republicans will not
       likely nominate him.  And if the Democrats even think about
       nominating him, it may finally be enough for the Left to reject the
       Democratic party.

 no it does not mean anyone with a D is cool ([510]0+ / 0-)
       but Republicons already tried to use him for racial cover,

       He is not crazy.  He is not in agreement with the current top

   that McCrony, Tillis, et. al. will dismiss Powell as a one-off.  He IS
   a one-off -- within the GOP.  He may be the sole voice of reason in the
   entire party.  And perhaps fortunately (or not) for us, he's maybe the
   one guy who could save the Republican party... and they're blowing him
   off.  He was marginalized in the Bush 43 Regime because he raised a
   voice of caution about the war.  He was marginalized further when he

   leadership, he retains no relevance at all.

       Unless they actually vote, either at their actual polling location,
       or by absentee ballot, their vote wouldn't count from this because
       of going to the wrong polling location.
       It would certainly draw attention to the horrible vote suppressing
       things Republicans did in the bill though, like blatantly taking
       away polling locations from colleges and leaving them with a far
       drive to a much smaller place to vote (I read one spot would have
       30 parking spaces for over 3,000 registered voters from the GOP's
       change).
       What we really need is a law at the federal level that says for
       every 100 voters you need 1 voting machine and X parking spaces or
       something at the voting locations. And laws on how far you can make
       someone drive to vote (some Indians on Indian Reservations have to
       driver over 100 miles to vote!)

   is and do their bidding while they deign to smile at him and tell him

   What are the other policies in the Republican Party that Powell so
   adores?  Harming workers?  Starving children?  Denying all science and

   Pouring poison into drinking water?  Worshipping the idols God and Mary

     Saleh is the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit targeting six
     key members of the Bush Administration: George W. Bush, Richard
     Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, and Paul
     Wolfowitz.
      [...]The aim of the suit is simple: to achieve justice for Iraqis,
     and to show that no one, not even the president of the United
     States, is above the law.

   How can it be widespred? Good question

     To seek legal redress, Comar Law is invoking the Alien Tort Statute,
     a law passed in 1789 that permits a non-U.S. national the ability to
     sue in federal court for injuries "committed in violation of the law
     of nations or a treaty of the United States." The case was filed on
     March 13, 2013, with the U.S. District Court in Northern Calif., and
     the defendants have all been served notice to appear... in early
     2014.

   Powell:

     Sends the wrong message. "sort of punishing you"

   Sort of punishing?

     "It immediately turns off a voting block the Republican Party
     needs,"

   So it's about the party first, not peoples civil rights.

   While it's good to hear a republican especially one of Powells'
   stature, speaking out against his own talk radio based party platform,
   it rings hollow. At least to me is does

   OT .. but still I'm left wondering what mistake Powell is concerned
   with. It seems his focus is on how it looks and sounds to be a
   republican, not what voter nullification, suppression or purging does
   to actual people.

       The Republican party of today has no comparison to the party of

       Example: You mentioned Nixon.  There were plenty of Repubs working
       the impeachment process. It never really got that far because
       REPUBLICANS were convinced he had to go, and convinced him he had
       to resign.  Can you even imagine that happening in today's
       Republican party?
       Bob Dole, Gerald Ford, Christine Todd Whitman, are the first
       examples that come to mind, but there are many others. That does

   They do not care about winning fair and square, or engaging in the

   achieving a permanent Republican governing body (Karl Rove.) It does

 Rethink your party? ([862]0+ / 0-)

   keeps?  His party is riddled with the lunatic fringe, maybe it's time

   This event happened in my neighborhood. Pat McCrory was the first
   speaker, but HE LEFT before Colin Powell took the stage. McCrory knew
   what was coming and chickened out of being there while Powell's speech
   commenced.
