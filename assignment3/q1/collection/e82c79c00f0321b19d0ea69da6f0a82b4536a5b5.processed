   C&J Banner

   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   Monument to a Dirtbag

   The media will be fixated tomorrow on the opening of the $250 million
   ("Just put it on someone's credit card, we'll pay for it later") George
   W. Bush Terrible President Library at Southern Methodist University.
   It's an imposing structure, and I can't imagine what the hell they've
   filled its 207,000 square-feet with. I have a few ideas, though, for
   what I'd put on display. This is just a partial list:

     o The [29]'Mission Accomplished' banner and the codpiece he wore ten
     years ago when he declared that major combat operations had ended in
     Iraq even though they continued for the rest of his presidency.

     o The chair in which he sat, [30]frozen, at Booker Elementary School
     on 9/11 after he was told "America is under attack." Also his
     dog-eared copy of "The Pet Goat."

     o A bag of pretzels, of course.

     o On a continuous loop in the lobby: a recording of the push-poll
     question his campaign used to destroy John McCain in 2000...

     "Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for John McCain for
     president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?"

     ...just to show visiting school kids what a classy guy Bush is.

   George W. Bush Presidential Library
   Fortress of Ineptitude.

     o A piece of the [31]birthday cake he shared with John McCain in
     Phoenix as the levees were busting open in New Orleans.

     o The [32]golf club he swung immediately after vowing to "stop these
     terrorist killers."

     o The 2005 [33]"Can I go pee?" note he scribbled to Condi Rice at
     the United Nations.

     o The Segway he [34]fell off of in 2003.

     o A credit card bill forwarded from the White House to "The People
     of the United States of America" with a balance of $10 trillion.

     o The August 6, 2001 PDB: [35]Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside
     US.

     o Some aluminum tubes.

     o The [36]vial of baby powder Colin Powell used to scare us to death
     at the United Nations.

     o The best of FEMA Director Michael Brown's [37]Katrina emails,
     including "I am a fashion god" and "Can I quit now? Can I go home?"

     o A [38]photo collage of the U.S. soldiers who died during the Iraq
     war underneath a sign that says, "Oops!"

     o The shoes that were [39]thrown at him by a journalist during his
     last visit to Iraq.

     o The shirt Bill Clinton was wearing in Haiti when Bush used it as a
     rag to [40]wipe a commoner's cooties off his hand in 2010.

   That's for starters, anyway. Since the above items would only fill a
   fraction of the space, what would you add to help preserve the essence
   of the 43rd president who left office with 22 percent approval? Oh,
   that reminds me: I'd also post a copy of his [41]22 percent approval
   poll. Right above the front door.

   Cheers and Jeers starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW!
   [HehHehHeh...]

   Cheers and Jeers for Wednesday, April 24, 2013

   Note: Due to the sequester, today's note will be two hours late.

   CHEERS to replacing Mr. Baucus with Mr. Raucous.  Praise the
   lord---Senator [46]Max Baucus is retiring next year.  He was an
   infuriating "blue dog" type whose spine was made of silly putty.  It'll
   be a hoot if this guy replaces him:

   IFRAME: [47]http://www.youtube.com/embed/Qur80XKiW9E

   Strap on your bolo, Schweitzer...your country needs you.

   CHEERS to #14.  By a vote of 331-225, France's national Assembly voted
   to grant marriage rights to same-sex couples---the 14th country to make
   it official.  Before the vote, police [48]surrounded the building with
   water cannons.  Y'know, here in America we usually just throw rice, but
   whatever.  Mazel Tov.

   P.S. Meanwhile, Rhode Island's Senate Judiciary Committee sent a
   marriage-equality bill to the full Senate, which will vote on it today.
    If it passes, it'll go to Governor Chafee's desk, making New England
   the first major region in America to be down with the gay-marrieds.
   And we don't need no stinkin' water cannons, so suck it, France.

   JEERS to nervous nabobs of negativity.  Yesterday someone hacked into
   the AP's twitter feed and [49]posted an alarming message about
   President Obama, after which stocks briefly plunged because, when push
   comes to shove (or in this case a fake attack on the White House), this
   is what was going through investor's minds:

     "Oh my god! This is terrible! I mean, I know we all give the Obama a
     lot of shit and say a bunch of stuff about him that isn't true.  And
     I know I pretend that Republicans aren't total assholes who obstruct
     everything he does just because they know if his policies are fully
     implemented the nation will prosper and Republicans will go the way
     of the dodo even faster than they already are.  But I love the guy!
      He's been a terrific president!  This is just horrible and...
     What's that?  It was a hoax?  Obama isn't going bye bye bye?  Then
     BUY BUY BUY!!!"

   You could set your diamond-encrusted watch by these guys.

   CHEERS to easy layups.  Today is [50]Pig in a Blanket Day.  Or, as it's
   also known: Rush Limbaugh's nappytime.

   CHEERS to joining the fight.  We're wrastlin' with some gun bills up
   here in the Maine legislature (with the feds diddling, gun-control
   progress will only be made at the state level, it seems), and the
   responsible side just got a nice shot in the arm (er, so to speak) from
   one of our [51]most famous residents:
   Stephen King publicity photo
   For smart
   gun laws.

     Maine author Stephen King and his wife have made what's being called
     a "substantial donation" to a statewide group advocating for
     stricter gun control laws.

     The Coalition for a Safer Maine says King is a gun owner...who also
     supports expanded background checks on gun sales and a ban on the
     sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.

   While he was at it, King also came out in favor of airbags on all
   demonically-possessed Plymouth Furies.

   CHEERS to putting out fires.  Ever since the Supreme Court decided Bush
   v. Gore, acid reflux has been my constant burning companion.  So I
   admit to being euphoric about the new device that's being called a
   [52]bracelet for your throat:
   Linx anti-reflux bracelet by Torax Medical
   "Bracelet for your
   throat" treats GERD.

     The Linx device, made by Torax Medical Inc. of St. Paul, Minn., is a
     ring of titanium beads with magnets inside. Doctors place it around
     the weak muscle at the base of the esophagus in a half-hour
     operation using a scope and "keyhole" incisions in the belly.

     The ring reinforces the weak muscle to keep it closed, yet is
     flexible and expands to let food pass when someone swallows. The
     ring comes in multiple sizes; it is about a ½-inch in diameter and
     expands to about 1½ inches. People don't feel it once it is
     implanted.

   Researchers say they put it through the most rigorous testing
   imaginable, and the results were remarkable.  Patients were actually
   able to sit through 30 minutes of Fox News.  A miracle, really.

   Five years ago in C&J: April 24, 2008

   JEERS to getting older.  I started really loving movies in the
   late-70s, and a lot of that had to do with the reviews that came
   through my teevee every week by Roger Ebert and his late co-host Gene
   Siskel.  Nothing else existed in the world when Sneak Previews aired.
   Ebert's been a real trooper lately, enduring multiple throat surgeries
   and now a broken hip that'll [53]keep him away from his own film
   festival.  I hope I have half his optimism and energy if I ever find
   myself in the same circumstances.  Positive vibes for a speedy
   recovery.

   P.S. [54]Best opening sentence in a movie review so far in 2008: "Jason
   Segel's penis probably would not sell a lot of tickets all by itself."
    Really!

   -

   And just one more...
   Fotomat
   True Fact: All Hubble pics
   are developed at Fotomat.
   CHEERS to our big eye in the sky.  23 years ago today, the Hubble space
   telescope was [55]placed into orbit by the crew of the Space Shuttle
   Discovery.  When the first photos were revealed to we Earthlings,
   Democrats saw the wonder of an evolving universe and the hope of
   discovering intelligent life one day and harnessing our collective
   strengths for the good of the cosmos.  Republicans saw potential oil
   fields and the hope of discovering millions of new suckers on which to
   foist reverse-mortgages and other toxic assets.  Eh.  Potato, Puhtahto.

   Have a cosmic Wednesday.  Floor's open...What are you cheering and
   jeering about today?

   [70]Tagging tips - [71]Search For Tags - [72]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [73]Civil
   Rights, [74]Community, [75]Congress, [76]Culture, [77]Economy,
   [78]Education, [79]Elections, [80]Energy, [81]Environment, [82]Health
   Care, [83]International, [84]Labor, [85]Law, [86]Media, [87]Meta,
   [88]National Security, [89]Science, [90]Transportation, or [91]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([92]California, [93]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       The orioles are here!  The orioles are here!  The orioles are here!
       Same day every year for the last five years: 23 April.  Me and Mrs
       grog were down at the [146]Dauphine at 6 last night, later than
       usual.  I had put an oriole feeder out last Friday since we'd seen
       our first hummingbird (they'll drink out of the oriole feeders just
       as easily as a dedicated h-bird feeder).  It's 38 degrees out with
       a heavy mist, miserable weather.  And a big ole male Baltimore
       Oriole plops onto the feeder!  As Mrs grog put it "well, I won't
       have your attention for the next six weeks".  It's true, now I'll
       wander around constantly looking up into the trees whenever I hear
       one.  Even better, there was a male Orchard Oriole on the feeder!
       We haven't seen Orchards in at least five years now.  For a
       three-year period, we had plenty of them to include a pair that
       nested down low in one of our trees in the front yard of the house.
        So this is already shaping up to be a good year for orioles here.
       Jeers to being a brain dead moran.  Yesterday morning I get up for
       my run.  I trot down to go under the train tracks totally
       forgetting that the "underpass" is flooded.  As I look ahead I
       think "gee, it doesn't look 'right' under there", I run into the
       water.  Totally soaked my shoes.  I backed up and crossed the
       tracks via the unprotected crossing which is opened when the
       underpass floods.
       Jeers to not running this morning because it was 36 degrees outside
       with more heavy mist.  Too miserable to run in unless forced to by
       training.
       Cheers to Elsie:
       [elsie.png]
       Another photo from SnoKat's visit.  When we got Elsie, she wasn't
       at all this dark; we thought she was a "tabby point" Siamese mix.
       Turns out she's a Siamese mix with a healthy dose of torbie in her
       which means, yes, she's got a dose of torbie wierdness in her, at
       least according to Mrs grog.  Elsie is the quintessential lap cat
       tho, showing that such kittehs are born, not made.

       When she was young and still pretty much white all over except for
       her pointing, the effect was even more pronounced if you can

 I volunteer with a cage free no-kill cat rescue ([228]8+ / 0-)

       We get some gorgeous kitties.  We took in 4 from a hoarding
       situation.  Two of them were 13 years old.  All 4 had been dumped
       at a high kill shelter.  One is a seal point siamese who is
       beautiful.  She's almost completely brown but her points show up
       well.  If you know anyone in the DC/Baltimore area, we have about
       12-14 cats currently available.  Most of them are adopted as bonded
       pairs and they are indoor/outdoor cats.  We have an outdoor
       enclosure for them.  We have some great barn cats!  Rescue cats are
       the best.

       It would take creativity to change the signs, but there is more
       than enough creativity in NYC to de-patsify that corner,

   Seriously, the reichwingnuts need to get a grasp on reality and start
   figuring out just WHO is "censoring" the news or giving us stupid
   infotainment instead of actual news.  [NB: Who won a reality show or
   who was kicked off a reality show or which celebrities split up or got
   married is NOT "news" - it's infotainment!!!  That's the reason shows
   like TMZ, etc., exist!  Do NOT promote infotainment gossip as the top
   story of the day!]

   BTW, I don't want "both sides of the story" or "various opinions about
   a story."

   I want truth and facts.  I know, I know.  Reading facts from a
   teleprompter would be boring as hell, but at least facts can be dealt
   with.

   Truth and just plain facts do not have "sides." I genuinely don't give
   a flying fig about opinions promoted as "news" from the reichwingnuts.

   My IQ is higher than a rock and I can make up my own mind and form my
   own opinions based on delightfully boring facts and plain truth sans
   reichwingnut "opinions," tyvm.

   I'm sick of attempts to steer this nation from principles evolved in
   The Age of Reason to hallucinations derived from illiterate herdsmen. ~

   MORE THAN TWO YEARS after a long spate of post-election violence: the
   [995]Ivory Coast is trying to address the issue, with a Truth and

   WEDNESDAY's CHILD is [997]Sammy the Hero Cat - an Ohio kitteh who saved
   the life of his housemate dog Izzy - who was in-the-mouth of a bigger
   dog, about to be torn apart - when Sammy puffed-up, causing the big dog

       It still counts against us when we look old and wise, so it is
       necessary to attempt to disguise the fact that one is older to be
       taken seriously by the media.  Robert Redford's face is at long

   need to cut SS and chain it up.  I now have a question for Messrs.
   Simpson/Bowles.  Yesterday I found out you could not buy any sort of
   dog or cat food with food stamps.

   Recognizing that many elderly rely on SS for 60% or more of their
   income, many are on the thin edge between eating human food and eating
   pet food, I wish the two gentlemen would answer me if they would be
   willing to change STEM regs so elders could use the stamps to buy cat
   food?  If not, assuming food stamps are not adequate to cover an entire
   month's food and assuming that some elders lack the funds to buy even
   cat food by the end of the month and may only have food stamp funds
   (which are sufficient, let us say for two days' food when it is a week
   before the end of the month), what are the elderly supposed to eat
   those final days of each month (ignoring that many elderly indigent are
   malnourished due to a variety of reasons ranging from poor dentition to
   a lack of fresh fruit and veggies in the diet)?

       official results were that the hospital has never seen numbers as
       high as her (positive readings would be 20 or above -- she was 230)
       Today I'll be waiting for results... Her stomach hurts, but she's
       not reacting like before. The nerve-wracking part is keeping her
       entertained for the three plus hours this test takes. She's
       hypoglycemic, so no food is making her more hyper than normal...

        Recommended by:
                [1679]The Marti, [1680]rebereads, [1681]Audri

       she has such an extreme carbohydrate sensitivity. A sensitivity to
       brown rice means that even the bran is sensitizing to her. In
       India, the bran is used for infants that fail to thrive as a last
       resort, and the bran has saved many babies' lives. If your daughter
       reacts so strongly to the rice bran, she has a deep constitutional
       imbalance. The reason I mentioned homeopathy is that, like
       Traditional Chinese Medicine, the medicine works with
       constitutional issues.
       Conventional medicine can diagnose where her present sensitivities
       lie. But once she is on a given diet that works for her, she may
       well eventually develop sensitivities to those foods as well. She
       has some constitutional issues that may be better addressed by
       alternative methods than just an elimination diet.
       Again, this is a difficult situation, but you are one motivated
       mom! That will probably ultimately lead you to a diet you both can
       live with for her.

       absolutely refused to eat it.  This was a dog who would eat dirty
       socks and cat poo, so it wasn't because he was a fussy eater.
       A relative pointed out that the dog was a Shetland SHEEPdog and he
       was supposed to protect the sheep, not eat them.  LOL.
       He loved bison, when we switched to that.

       accept a new food, but ferrets after a certain age they really
       don't believe that something that smells different is really food.
        It generally works to put a little of the new food in the

   the old neighborhood on his own.  Now he is like those people who lived
   through the Depression, who hoard food they will never possibly be able
   to eat.  If Kitty-Kitty's bowl doesn't have a BIG heap of kibble in it,
   he gets very anxious and meows through the house like he's starving.
   He will even gnaw a hole in the bag of food, even when his bowl has a
   bit of kibble in it, if he thinks it might not be enough for a few
   days.

   Poor kitty.  He's such a sweet thing.  He's really become quite hefty
   since he joined us, but it would be very mean to limit his food.

   funds to print DLs:
   [2518]http://www.rawstory.com/...

   Seems some time ago, they decided to combine CWPs and DLs so cops
   stopping a motorist would also be able to determine he was licensed to
   carry and may have a firearm on his person.  It was a public safety
   issue to make cops safer.  Very laudable until GOP CTs got busy.

   Hang on for the explanation.  A legislator's wife testified that there
   was a UN plot, Agenda 21, to disarm Americans and install Obama as a
   dictator.  Since Missouri ignores the 2005 REAL Act, they were
   concerned that the state was keeping records on who had CWPs because
   the list could fall into federal hands.  Since this information was
   retained with the DL, the legislators have defunded the state Dept of
   Revenue's DL Bureau, the Dept of Public Safety and state Office of
   Administration.

   So it appears Missouri has quit issuing DLs. Of course, photo ID is
   required to vote so I am not sure how that will work out for the state
   and photo ID is required to buy a firearm, so the NRA should also be
   displeased.
   GOP has really hit the Trifecta with this one

 Don't know about the GERD thing... ([2566]0+ / 0-)
       When I got my right knee replaced, I got a little piece of plastic
       the size of a credit card with the name of the corporation who made
       the knee implant.  Then it lists my name, the date the knee was
       implanted, my ortho surgeon's name, and the phone number.
       My left knee is almost as painful as the right was before I had
       that one replaced, so I expect I'll get a second card for the other
       one when I have that replaced.  I have degenerative arthritis, so
       several bone joints are painful and not all of them can be
       replaced.
       I didn't get any such card when I had my anterior-posterior triple
       spinal fusion, and for that I have two titanium rods and titanium
       wire (looks like a large paperclip) strung through one side since I
       didn't have enough hip bone to make more fusion material, so only
       one side is fused with my bone.  I have the option of having the
       titanium rods and screws taken out, but I'm not doing that since
       the surgery didn't quite "take" and I still have pain in my back.
       My spinal rods didn't seem to set off any metal detectors, but the
       last time I was at the courthouse I deliberately did not wear any
       metal things, wore a skirt so I could show the officers my scar if
       required, and the knee did set off the metal detector and I told
       the officers I have a metal knee and back and have an ID card for
       the knee.
       I expect I'll have to be hand-wanded at security for the rest of my
       life.

   My day so far: overslept, scrambled for work, running late for an 8 am
   meeting....that actually doesn't start until 9. I have this meeting
   every week.

   So here's the question of the day: what are "we" (by which I mean some
   of we) so afraid of? I was reading someone's diary last night about an
   admittedly ugly event in the news, and the comment thread took about 2
   seconds to veer off topic and explode into an argument about religion
   and why we should all be athiests. (Note: I really appreciate that C&J
   seems to be full of people who can disagree without requiring someone
   else to change behavior.) This morning, a brief diary that included a
   derogatory reference to a lifestyle choice that resulted in nearly as
   many HRs as recs. And the reference was in no way related to the
   topic--and that happens a lot. Come on, people, you don't have to like
   country music, but why do you care if someone else does? It's kind of
   like there are people (who probably aren't reading this!) who have to
   kind of auto-slur someone or some group before (they think) they'll be
   taken seriously?

   Quote of the day: what's so funny about peace, love, and understanding
   (Elvis Costello)? Why should letting people live their lives (when they
   aren't in the business of causing harm, anyway), why should working for
   peace or the health and well-being of all be something that we regard
   as less-than, vis a vis violence, putting people in their place, or
   advocating they do things "our" way?

   It just seems like there's been so much of that everywhere lately--more
   publicly than ever. (not going to pretend it hasn't been behind the
   scenes) Is it just me, or does anyone else feel like there's an
   unsettling momentum building and the rest of us should settle in for a
   group meditation and hand out cups of chamomile tea and plates of lemon
   lavender cookies to any passing stranger.

   Angsty-rant over. Thanks for listening. Maybe I won't read anything

   ... of toxic posts.  Everyone has opinions and I respect that as long
   as the opinions are expressed coherently and without malice.  Everyone
   is free to express her/his opinion; that's what the First Amendment is
   for.  I will always respectfully agree to disagree with anyone.  Who
   knows?  When an opinion is expressed cogently, I may think about it and
   change my mind.  It could certainly make me more willing to even try to
   understand where the other person is coming from in holding their
   opinions.

   Facts are facts, and truth is truth and those can't really be changed
   with opinions about facts or truth.

   On a web site where we're all supposed to be adults, there's just no
   cause to resort to snotty grade-school behavior (unless we're talking
   about the Bushista regime - they embarrassed us and shamed us as a
   nation, et cetera and so on and so forth - we all know the litany of
   reasons that goes on for many, many pages - then I understand about the
   juvenile name-calling and snotty attitude since I then resort to the
   same because words have not yet been invented to express what loathsome
   and vile creatures they are and how much they deserve to be spending
   the rest of their evil little lives in prison).

       Did you close the valve under the sink? Over time that flow adds up
       to real gallons. It might be cheap, but there's never enough water

   Somebody go to the Bush the Terrible President Library (so I don't have
   to) and see whether any of those items actually appear there. Not just
   (for example, the chair and book from 9/11/2001) in the background, but
   noted as historical objects themselves.

   I expect the Terrible President Library will be just as terrible as was
   Bush the Terrible.

   But at least now, courtesy of Bill in Portland Maine, we have the
   proper way to distinguish the two Bush presidents: Bush the Bad and
   Bush the Terrible.

   After way too many years away from it, I hopped on my shiny new bicycle
   yesterday for the ride into work.  I'm out of practice and a bit out of
   shape (though much better than a year ago!) so it took longer than it
   should have, but it's happening.  I'll probably do two days a week for
   these first few weeks, and then try to make it 3-4 days after that.
   Since it's SF, I'll be able to ride year-round, and the heart of the
   trip takes me through Golden Gate Park.   Yea!

       I just got a shiny new bike as well, but the Great State of Maine
       is a bit more meteorologically (sp) challenged than SF. May you
       rack up many wonderful, carbon saving, invigorating, scenic miles
       on your new bike (while mine is in the shed waiting for Maine Mud

   This will take some time.

   1) Pick a Clydesdale, any Clydesdale.

   2) Feed it while you...

   3) Follow it around with a shovel and a large wagon for one full year.

   4) Deliver year's worth of Clydesdale aftermath to library.

   It will serve as a metaphor for merely one of the eight years our
   nation suffered from GWB's own very similar contributions.

   5) Rinse shovel. Burn wagon.

   I had to vote for Cuyahoga Valley National Park. It's the only one on
   the list I haven't seen. In fact, I don't remember even hearing about
   it. But I found it on the map, so I know that Bill didn't invent it to
   see who would vote for a nonexistent park.

   Turns out I've been near there. If they had put the Rock and Roll Hall
   of Fame there instead of on the shores of Lake Erie, I would have it on
   my list of Places Visited.

   I really won't go to any site (national park, state park, museum, point
   of interest, etc.) that is in a state where the crazies have taken
   over.

   I particularly want to visit the Nashville Parthenon. Anyone ever see
   this amazing simulation in concrete?

   Nashville Parthenon:
   [3532]http://en.wikipedia.org/...

   I have visited the real Parthenon in Athens. I was amazed there at all
   the broken columns, pieces of stonework and statuary. I also was amazed
   at the stonework of the restorers who are gradually bringing the
   building and the whole Acropolis site into a stable form that can
   resist further threats. I even visited the "Elgin marbles" in the
   British Museum.

   Historical Video of Parthenon (REALLY COOL):
   [3533]http://www.dailymotion.com/...

   But it's very expensive to go there now. A trip to the Nashville
   Parthenon would give much of the impression of both the original and
   the current strucuture for the price of a car trip, dinner, and
   overnight stay. You could even see the statue of Athena, recently
   reconstructed by a really courageous artist, working in a conservative
   area such as Nashville.

   Nashville Parthenon Statue of Athena:
   [3534]http://www.nashville.gov/...

   Athena was the Goddess of Wisdom, you know.

   I won't go to Nashville. I won't go there until Tennessee gets its
   collective head out of its ass. Tennessee progressives? They will have
   to contribute their greatest effort to the extrication of that
   collective head which presently is where the sun don't shine.

   "Athena... is the goddess of wisdom, courage, inspiration,
   civilization, law and justice, just warfare, mathematics, strength,
   strategy, the arts, crafts, and skill... Athena is also a shrewd
   companion of heroes and is the goddess of heroic endeavour."
   [3535]http://en.wikipedia.org/...

   Tennessee needs the "help" of Athena desperately.

   I'll just forego going to any sites in "crazy" states and just stay
   home or go overseas to places where heads are in more sensible
   positions: Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands,
   New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Uruguay,
   and very likely France.

   There.

       I wish I could go to the "real" one, but the Nashville site gives a
       really good feel for what it must have been like when the Parthenon
       was whole.  There is a lot of information on the history of the
       Athens Parthenon and the building of the the Nashville Parthenon.

 The Athena statue... ([3553]1+ / 0-)

       Charles,
       Did you look at the video above (in daily motion)?
       One of the scenes was "christianISTs" knocking down all the pagan
       statues off the Parthenon.
       I don't recall what the original fate of the Athena statue was, but
       around 390 to 425 CE, "christianISTs" were destroying pagan arts,
       literature and science at a record rate.
       So, with regard to this Athena statue, it is PAGAN of origin, and
       the legend of course ascribes "wisdom" to Zeus emerging from his
       forehead as Athena. See?
       Now, there are a lot of nut-cases in US-based christianISM, and
       they kill doctors, hurt people they don't like, and do other nasty
       things their "sky god" tells them to do.
       I am surprised that the Athena artist didn't get death threats,
       frankly. ;o)

       It was The Pet Goat - not My Pet Goat.  BiPM's video has him
       reading from the book along with the teacher and the students.  [I
       never did think Dumbya looked "frozen," however.  I think he looked
       smug, like he was about to break out in a smile with his lips
       barely turning up at the corners a couple of times.  Given what
       resulted from that day with unconstitutional and illegal
       legislation that's still in effect, and unconstitutional and
       illegal wars and torture and the like, the little dictator had
       reason to want to smile.]
       You and Hendrix the Magnificent look wonderful.  How many places
       could one go where they can play with fur people as they also have
       a good time otherwise?  I admit, I've heard of other B&Bs with
       animals, and remember seeing one on a segment on local TV where
       people could even have one of several resident B&B cats in their
       room when they retired for the night.  That would make one feel
       right at home, I should think.

   3.  Similar to the Holocaust Museum, a collection of shoes from all of

 May I suggest something? ([3684]0+ / 0-)
       Can a nurse or someone see your MIL for her butt problem and school
       MIL on how to apply her own creams?  Or get her to wipe and/or wash
       herself properly so no one else has to do such things for her?  Or
       did you already say that has been done and she still doesn't follow
       directions?  Get a nurse/medical person to go over it again and
       again and again and again until she finally listens?
       I've been following this MIL butt problem for ages now, and have
       slowly formed the opinion that MIL has a psychological problem if
       she insists others have to tend to her ass and/or close to her ass
       rashes and/or other problems in her nether regions.
       A medicated sitz bath or something might be a good remedy..., as
       long as it's a visiting nurse or other caretaker that does the
       physical helping.  There are ads for specialized tubs for old
       people now - might need to remodel the bathroom, but it would be
       preferable to you having to tend to your MILs personal nether
       regions.  It should not have to be you who tends to personal
       regions of MIL's body.
       [I'm speaking as an old woman here.  I would come close to dying of
       embarrassment if a medical person had to take care of my personal
       needs, and just might at least pass out from embarrassment if a
       relative had to take care of me.  I had a hard enough time with the
       catheter after my spinal surgery in 2000.  Mercifully, saving me
       from embarrassment, they had inserted it after they anesthetized me
       for the eight+ hour surgery, and removing it a day or two later
       took all of two seconds, but I was red-faced while they had to
       spread my legs to do so.  (I've always had a difficult time with
       medical exams that involve spreading my legs for a stranger, be it
       vaginal or rectal exams.)  I would never ask a relative to do such
       personal things for me as apply a medicated cream or anything else
       involving the region between my legs.  Perhaps a husband if I had
       one of those since he would be familiar with the region because of
       "personal association" as part of a marital relationship, but
       certainly no others, most particularly not relatives.]

       Eh, my skin. Can't scratch it, can't live without it... I'm
       actually a little bummed--I had a 'procedure' to remove all the
       pre-cancerous crap growing on my face & scalp(don't worry, you can
       hardly see them, they're not repulsive) that was kinda
       painful(anytime you're 'burning' your entire scalp & face it is NO
       FUN) back in the beginning of March. I had to shave my scalp,
       rendering me an Uncle Fester look-alike. My hair has grown
       back(almost), and so have the fucking precancerous bullshit
       growths. Fuckers. Certainly a painful way to waste $700. Jeers to
       Dermatologists, pre-cancerous growths, skin, sun, and my lack of
       melanin.  :(

   Recommended by:

   As in: moaning with pleasure?  Those I can deal with.

   It was the screaming in terror ones after ingesting ibuprofen or other
   placenta-colored pills with red dye that bothered me because they came
   with raging fear and a wildly beating heart, especially since the first
   few seconds of waking up involved being 'frozen in fear,' as in, I
   couldn't move those first seconds of consciousness.  After those
   nightmares started, I actually had a tape recorder beside my bed and
   recorded a few of them once I woke up enough to actually move and could
   speak coherently.  (I always feared waking neighbors because the walls
   here are not soundproof.)

   Oh, yeah.  I did tell the pharmacist that the placenta-red pills give
   me nightmares and he special-orders pills without red food dye for me.

   No pills with red dye = no more nightmares either.  :-)

   Apart from a meeting about a potential new project, we have an
   agency-wide telemeeting which will discuss "big changes." The big
   changes were mentioned in LAST WEEK'S agency-wide telemeeting (I missed
   it, since I was driving around the Bay Area like a mad man all day).
   It's probably not a good strategy to leave several thousand employees
   dangling for seven days. I suspect the changes will include the closing
   of a number of our smaller offices.

   CHEERS and JEERS to returning to normal. After a couple of very warm

       Huge apology to America AND to the rest of the world - with special

       countries which were conned into being the "coalition of the

       for the f##king unconstitutional, illegal, unjustified, immoral,

       We'll need additional apologies to the countries that have been
       bombed with drones since Obama became prez, too, dammit.  I thought
       Democrats were supposed to be better than Repukes.
       Also the Bushista Liberry needs a group photo of the $COTU$

   I'd go back to either one in a heartbeat.  I love mountains!

   Well, now in my old age I have to look at them from ground level (Grand
   Canyon is out; I'd never survive a trip there).  I'm pretty sure I
   could not drive those places any longer.  With old age (or menopause,
   not sure which) came a weird, very miserable disorienting feeling when
   looking at photos from a high level, and when people are involved (like
   sitting atop a natural ledge overlooking a fjord, or views from
   skyscrapers), I get the most gawdawful physical sick sensation in my
   stomach that moves to my lower abdomen where a woman's center of
   gravity is located and hip and knee joints, accompanied by numbness in
   my muscles like I'm going to both get sick and fall.  It hits in just
   an instant like an adrenalin rush, too, so when these sights come on in
   documentaries and movies I have to close my eyes instantly for fear of
   barfing on my laptop keyboard.

   Heck, I can't even do the two steps on my little mini-step ladder in
   the hallway to replace the light bulb in the hall light when it burns
   out even though the mini step ladder with two steps has a handle, so
   even replacing a light bulb in the ceiling fixture is out of the
   question, especially since it overlooks the steps below the railing so
   I get that gawdawful weak-sick feeling and it's like I'm going to fall
   over and down the stairwell.  Really, it's miserable.  The neighbor has
   to replace the bulb or I have to call the landlord.

   JEERS to old age..., but CHEERS to the knowledge that came with old
   age.  Now..., if Mother Nature could just figure out a way to leave me
   with the looks I had in youth while retaining the knowledge I've gained
   in old age....

   Siiiiiiiiiiiigh.

   CHEERS  I hope everyone has had a good day.  I slept waaaaay in, so I
   missed this morning's pool party.  I'm just not a morning person unless
   I've been up all night.

       ... primarily because I didn't have this until menopause hit.  I
       don't actually have dizzy spells (altho I have a cousin who has
       vertigo problems).  It's only looking down from a height (in real
       life or on videos/movies) that gives me that zooming dizzy feeling
       that washes over me as fast as an adrenalin rush.  It's a very
       physical sensation and just takes a second or two to happen.
       Explaining it or writing about it takes much longer.
       As a young girl, woman, no problems.  As a kid in grade school I
       imitated the circus performers on the trapeze bar and rings (no
       net, even!), and I actually did what they did (if my mother had
       seen that she would have been scared spitless and I'd have been
       grounded).  Driving in the mountains was no problem in my young
       adult years.  Heights were no problem.
       It was only after menopause hit that heights - more specifically,
       looking down from heights - became a problem.  On level ground,
       level floors, etc., not a problem.  It's only looking down from
       great heights (in person or via documentaries or movies) that I
       feel all those odd sensations, feel like I'm losing my balance, and
       have to hang on to something.
       Keep in mind, so far I've not fallen, and I even have stairs to go
       up and down to get to/from wherever because I'm in an upstairs
       apartment.  I hang on to the railing and brace myself against the
       wall on the other side now, however!  When I first moved here,
       there was no problem, and when I was a young woman I did two stairs
       at a time, up and down, in virtually all buildings that had stairs,
       and that in heels quite often (esp. at work).
       It felt odd to have this happen the first time.  I thought I went
       through menopause when I had a partial hysterectomy at age 27.  I
       still have the left ovary.  The right one had given me problems all
       the time, and the monthly cysts were painful, so I pretty much
       demanded it be taken out; the gynecologist asked if I wanted the
       uterus taken out at the same time or not (I'd also been through
       endometriosis by then - another painful problem, and by then I had
       figured out the b.c. pills had something to do with my migraines,
       too), so I said "Out; I don't want more children anyway."
       Obviously, painlessly, my left ovary functioned nicely until I was
       in my late 40s, early 50s and then I got the hot flashes and night
       sweats, etc.
       I was past 50 when this odd problem started, more like 55 or so.  I
       do okay as long as I close my eyes for heights in videos or as long
       as I hang on to things at a height of any kind.  Like I said, level
       surfaces are no problem, and I don't have dizzy spells that come on
       unexpectedly.
       So, whether it's Ménière's Disease or something else, I don't know.
        I associated it with menopause and aging because my mother had
       much the same thing.  The heights problem didn't affect her until
       after menopause either.
       If I remember, I'll bring it up at my next regular doctor's
       appointment..., altho I think I'll probably be too busy shocking
       him speechless.  At my last regular appointment I mentioned the
       county where I was born, he asked about a town, I told him I was
       born at the hospital there, and he mentioned a Scandinavian surname
       (his mother's birth name) and three uncles who lived there.  I
       didn't have any other info to go on because I didn't ask him if he
       wanted me to look up his genealogy and figured he'd think it was
       too odd, even though he's quite aware of my research on my own
       family.  Less than two hours after I got home, I had already found
       his birth, his parents names, his siblings and their births and
       spouses for some, grandparents, and Norwegian immigrant ancestor,
       including the immigrant's birth, confirmation, emigration info.
       Then a couple of hours later I discovered the immigrant had gone
       back to Norway and brought his parents back to America, got the
       ship's passenger list from that voyage and it noted he was a
       naturalized American, and I know where they're all buried.  I had
       asked my doctor about his surname before because I keep seeing it
       in old New England records but I've no idea whether or not he's
       connected to the early New England people with the same name or
       not; I've not been working on that line yet.  He hadn't mentioned
       having Norwegian ancestry until this last visit, and, of course,
       that's the easiest to find, but I doubt he knew where in Norway
       they were from.  In any case, I plan to give him the data when I
       see him in a couple of months.
