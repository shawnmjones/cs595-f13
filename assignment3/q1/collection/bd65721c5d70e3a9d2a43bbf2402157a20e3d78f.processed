[22]Fighting inequality begins at home

   Striking workers at a Mira Loma, California, Olivet International
   warehouse that supplies Walmart goods.
   This past Wednesday, President Obama kicked off a [29]speaking tour
   ahead of crucial negotiations with Congress on key budgetary matters.
   The president returned to Knox College, the site of his first address
   since taking office as a United States senator in 2005, to decry the
   deleterious effects that increasing income inequality is creating in
   the country's recovery from the recent worldwide economic crisis. As
   the Guardian notes, however, the speech did not highlight any new
   policy proposals beyond what the president has called for in previous
   addresses:

     There were no new policy proposals in the speech, which repackaged
     previously announced proposals for investment in infrastructure and
     education, tax reform and an increase to the minimum wage.

   President Obama is once again taking his policy goals to the American
   people, perhaps in the hope that public pressure for a better vision
   will finally convince Republicans in the House of Representatives--

   No, you didn't seriously think I was going waste your day speculating
   on whether it could perhaps be the case that maybe this time, just this
   once, Republicans in Congress could be convinced by any sort of public
   pressure or desire to find compromise with the Obama administration on
   key points of economic policy? Do I look like David Brooks? We are,
   after all, talking about a party that is [30]so desperate to make sure
   that Obama's agenda fails that they are willing to [31]convince young
   people to remain uninsured instead of participating in the lower-cost
   exchanges provided by so-called ObamaCare. So how about we dodge the
   speculation about how this turns out and skip to the endgame where
   Republicans refuse to budge on much of anything until the absolute last
   minute, the media blames Obama for "not leading," and very little is
   actually accomplished?

   The truth is, serious action on addressing income inequality will
   likely not come from the president once again beating his head against
   the stubborn wall of Republican intransigence. Follow below the fold.

   Given the high drama that will unfold in our nation's capital in the
   coming weeks and months, it's easy to forget that decisions made at the
   local level can have huge regional ramifications. It is a pleasant
   fantasy to dream of a Congress that would accede to, much less promote,
   needed investments in education and infrastructure, as well as a
   systematic economic goal of increasing wages rather than inflating
   assets. In the absence of such a fiction, however, states and cities
   can act on their own to accomplish similar objectives. California, for
   instance, recently [32]passed the Middle Class Scholarship Act, which
   will significantly reduce tuition at public universities. Meanwhile,
   there is a crucial fight brewing in Seattle about whether living wages
   are indeed part of the public good.

   Right now, a major issue in Seattle politics is an attempt by Whole
   Foods--a company with an [33]unpleasant record on labor issues--to
   build a megastore in West Seattle. Building the project would require
   vacating a public street and turning it over to a private
   developer--which gives the city some leverage, since it has authority
   over whether to grant such a request or not and consider whether it is
   in the public interest.

   The city council still has yet to weigh in, but Mayor Mike McGinn has
   taken a bold stand by [34]instructing the Seattle Department of
   Transportation to recommend that the council reject the request to
   vacate the road. In cases like this, one might expect that concerns
   about traffic or overdevelopment might prompt such a move, but McGinn
   [35]recognized that city ordinances allowed him to consider wages and
   benefits as part of what constitutes the overall public good.

     One of our core economic development goals is to provide fair and
     livable wages and benefits for our residents. The Economic
     Development elements of Seattle's Comprehensive Plan contain clear
     language to this effect: "seeking a greater proportion of living
     wage jobs that will have greater benefits" and "support key sectors
     of Seattle's economy to create jobs that pay wages that can support
     a family, provide necessary benefits, and contribute to the vitality
     of the City including, but not limited to, the industrial,
     manufacturing, service, hospitality and retail sectors." The primary
     retail use in the proposed project is a 41,000 square foot Whole
     Foods Market. There are already seven large supermarkets within a
     mile and half of the site, at least six of which offer
     employer-paid, comprehensive affordable health benefits for full and
     part-time employees and their families, as well as family-supporting
     wage scales. Family health benefits and employee wage scales offered
     by the proposed anchor tenant are significantly lower than other
     similar businesses, particularly for the growing percentage of
     employees who work part-time.

   Mayor McGinn is basically telling Whole Foods that if they wish to have
   a public street vacated on their behalf, then they need to join the
   rest of Seattle's local supermarkets in paying a fair wage and offering
   a comprehensive benefits package, or else no dice. Now, the primary in
   McGinn's reelection campaign is on Aug. 6, and two of his
   opponents--both Democrats--are [36]sharply critiquing McGinn's decision
   to stand with low-wage workers--choosing, strangely enough, to argue
   about process rather than substance. McGinn, however, is not just
   holding firm, but [37]actively campaigning on his decision:

     The city is under no obligation to sell public property to a company
     that will depress wages and benefits for workers at existing grocery
     stores in the same neighborhood. This city is fortunate in that we
     are growing and prospering, but too many people are left out of that
     prosperity. This is true not only here but nationwide, where we have
     had decades of rising inequality. And this is not just a theoretical
     discussion -- it has real impacts on people that work in our city.
     Will the person ringing up groceries have good health benefits? Will
     those who stock the shelves with the food we buy be able to live in
     this city?

   Many more people will be tweeting about President Obama's speeches than
   will be watching returns on the evening of Aug. 6 to see if Mayor
   McGinn will be rewarded for siding with labor unions and low-wage
   workers against an anti-union company like Whole Foods. But stopping
   the erosion of the middle class and fighting for good jobs won't occur
   by simply hoping that perhaps this time, President Obama can finally
   break a Republican House eternally dedicated to nullifying his
   existence. Instead, the fight against economic inequality begins at
   home, on the streets of our own cities. We wage it by standing in
   solidarity with low-wage workers in our own communities, organizing
   with them, and most of all, by electing real progressives at all levels
   of government who will wield power with economic justice in mind.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       This is politics as war and is fought on a street by street basis.

   Recommended by:
          [136]chuckvw

   While Republicans are, indeed, blocking anything like raising taxes on
   the rich or raising the minimum wage, there is one thing that Obama
   could do now and has talked about doing since 2008.

   He could sign an executive order requiring a living wage for all
   employees of federal contractors.  The Federal Government has more low
   wage employees than Walmart and McDonald's combined and[137]here is the
   story about it.

   When will Obama do the right thing and sign this executive order?

   coupled with Koch infested state leges are (not so) slowly strangling

   around, not much else will matter.

   Detroit is the template.

   Meanwhile, the Villagers are quietly celebrating the reduction of the
   deficit... with no meaningful increase in revenue and no significant
   cuts to the defense/security complex. The sequester, with its cuts to
   essential services is AOK, of course.

   McGinn is a mixed bag for me. What he's doing vis a vis Whole Foods is
   great. We'll see if he makes it through a very crowded primary...

 income inequality ([156]0+ / 0-)

   Raising minimum wages will simply increase unemployment among low
   skilled workers.

   Income inequality is the result of globalization.  Elizabeth Warren
   asked the right question when she asked what the minimum wage would be
   today if it tracked US productivity growth the past 30 years or so-the
   answer: $14.10.  Why is it not at this point?  Global competition.

   It is not some Republican conspiracy, after all, no one was a bigger
   free trade guy than Bill Clinton.

   Cheaper wages and huge productivity gains by other countries, i.e.
   China, have forced wages in low skilled industries to converge.  In
   China's case, they have gone up and in the higher wage US, down.

   The effects of globalization are so great that even 100% tax rates on
   the rich would not close a) our budget deficit or b) reduce inequality
   by very much (like Britain in the 70's, rich people's wealth would
   leave the country).

   The solution to income inequality is not some clunky government program
   but job training and a lot of it.   We simply must have the work force
   to do higher value added work.  I would vote any day for more
   government sponsored job training.

   One more thing.  Why would anyone who is worried about income
   inequality-me-ever, ever vote for immigration reform?  This is the
   worse piece of legislation for the poor that I can think of.
