[22]Report: Holder approved search warrant labeling reporter as a
co-conspirator

   Attorney General Eric Holder
   NBC News National [DEL: Investigative Correspondent :DEL]
   Co-conspirator Michael Isikoff [29]reports:

     Attorney General Eric Holder signed off on a controversial search
     warrant that identified Fox News reporter James Rosen as a "possible
     co-conspirator" in violations of the Espionage Act and authorized
     seizure of his private emails, a law enforcement official told NBC
     News on Thursday.

     The disclosure of the attorney general's role came as President
     Barack Obama, in a major speech on his counterterrorism policy, said
     Holder had agreed to review Justice Department guidelines governing
     investigations that involve journalists.

     "I am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill
     the investigative journalism that holds government accountable,"
     Obama said. "Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their
     jobs."

   Assuming he shares the generally understood definition of what a
   journalist's job is, what President Obama said yesterday is entirely
   correct. The problem is that it's completely at odds with the legal
   rationale his administration used to obtain the Rosen search warrant.

   It doesn't matter that Rosen hasn't been charged with a crime--the fact
   is that the search warrant accused him of criminal acts without giving
   him chance to respond to it before it was executed. That's pretty much
   the definition of being put at legal risk. Unless the guideline review
   renounces the tactic used in the Rosen case, the administration's
   policies will still be at odds with the principle articulated by the
   president.

   Meanwhile, Fox News chairman Roger Ailes yesterday [30]released a
   statement describing that administration's actions as "an attempt to
   intimidate Fox News." But while Ailes and his team will no doubt try to
   spin this into a partisan confrontation, the First Amendment doesn't
   say that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of The
   Fox News." Especially given the AP phone records subpoena, the issue
   isn't some sort of political witch hunt against Fox. Instead, it's that
   the government put its desire to stop leaks ahead of the Constitutional
   right to freedom of the press without even giving the press a chance to
   defend itself. That's a problem that needs to be fixed.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   sent from Rosen to the government agent.  They are quoted in full in
   the DoJ's affidavit, here is a snippet:

     "Let's break some news, and expose muddle-headed policy when we see
     it, or force the administration's hand to go in the right direction,
     if possible. The only way to this is to EXPOSE the policy...and the
     only way to that is with authoritative EVIDENCE."

   The affidavit really alleges some disgusting behavior by Rosen and
   alleges he participated with the government agent in releasing
   CLASSIFIED information.

   [158]Newscorpse:

     Rosen's admission that he was seeking to "force the administration's
     hand" in a direction that he believes is not "muddle-headded" is
     undeniable proof that he was acting as an operative, and not as a
     journalist. If Rosen thought that the government's policy was wrong,
     he could certainly say so without retribution. If he thought that
     the government was engaged in wrongdoing, he could certainly pursue
     and disclose evidence of that. But to seduce a government employee
     to illegally transfer classified documents in order to alter
     government policy merely because he disagrees with it, and absent
     any corruption or controversy, is a purely political act.

     The facts enumerated in the affidavit clearly reveal improper
     behavior and intent on Rosen's part. And it is not difficult to see
     why the judge, a Reagan appointee, concluded that there was probable
     cause to grant the request to examine Rosen's phone records.

     As I said at the beginning of this article "No matter what one
     thinks about the propriety of a government agency examining the
     phone records of a purported journalist, James Rosen does not
     deserve to regarded as one." And it is not coincidental that Rosen
     works for Fox News where political advocacy, not journalism, is
     their core mission.

     Fox has been working non-stop since their inception to "force the
     hand" of government, and not in a good direction. Don't forget that
     the CEO of Fox News, Roger Ailes, was a political operative for
     Richard Nixon and other ultra-rightists before he took the reins of
     a cable news network. And his boss, Rupert Murdoch, has spent
     decades exerting undue influence over governments around the world.
     Are the pieces beginning to fit together now? Fox News is not, and
     never has been, news.

       the Espionage Act does specify that publishing classified
       information is also illegal, and the Supreme Court has upheld the
       ability of the government to prosecute the press, or anyone else,
       for publishing or even receiving classified information (Gorin v
       United States, NY Times v United States, etc)
       There's a reason many spy-handlers have diplomatic covers--- to
       render them immune from this kind of prosecution. (They just get
       persona non grata'd out of the country.
       The government will often let the press off the hook as a courtesy,
       especially if the leak is not too severe.  But if it, say, tips of
       the North Koreans to the kind of information our spies are
       accessing, which undoubtedly led to the capture of our informants
       (as easily as Rosen's informant was caught)... well, that might be
       too severe a leak.  Especially since the leak served no public
       purpose--- the journalist was explicit that his goal was to scoop
       his competition.
       Conservatives need to realize that their Silent Moral Majority is
       neither silent, nor moral, nor a majority.

       Newspapers publish classified information all the time. There's no

 Ellsburg ([318]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   was not a reporter.

   He was not contacted by a report who cajoled him into leaking evidence
   to "force the government's hand".

   He leaked the information.

   Apparently the Supreme Court found that printing the information was
   protected.

   Also, the Pentagon Papers were embarrassing and showed that the
   Pentagon knew the war was not winnable and that the administration
   lied.

   In this instance, the leak revealed that a bomb had been intercepted
   and put people lives in direct danger in real time.

 Great questions! ([339]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [340]KayCeSF

   1) Ellsberg got a mistrial due to sloppy investigations.  Might as well
   ask why OJ walked.

   2) The NY Times case was about censoring the publication of the papers,
   not the legality of the leak and the solicitation thereof.

   3) How do we know that the reporters during the Bush administration
   didn't have their phones tapped and e-mails searched?  Remember: we
   don't really need warrants anymore, thanks to FISA.

   4) Obama has always made it clear that he is cracking down on leaks,
   and the Congress has long been in full-throated support.  Me too, for
   that matter.

   5) You point out that a mere handful of reporters have gotten their
   records searched over the last 4+ years, while the bulk of reporters
   working with leaks have not, and yet you're actually worried about a
   chilling effect?

       Leaks will still happen if there's something big to leak (like,
       say, the Pentagon Papers).  Ordinary intel on North Korean nuclear
       tests is not the same thing, and isn't worth breaking the law for.
        If journalists don't work as much getting leaks, then a) policy

       I certainly didn't get the news from Hillary Clinton. There was all
       you needed to know in the press. You just had to actually read it
       all.  They reported the facts.  The news was that there were no
       facts that justified invading a sovereign state.   The news was
       that age old allies like France did not believe there were any
       facts.   You do still have to read to find facts not just the
       headlines and it's the facts that are becoming increasingly

       American people get is the spin.   But I have to admit they're

       Lincoln realized, as things started to happen, that freeing the

       slaves, who spontaneously left their "owners" as the Union troops
       moved in, simply couldn't be re-enslaved while fighting the Civil
       War.
       Now, leaving the criminal bankers in charge of running the banks...
       this is preventing the country from getting out of the Depression.
        That's the economic situation.  Until we have honest banks, we
       aren't going to get out of the Depression.  The cirminality of the
       bankers is a huge drag on all economic activity.
       Until those criminals are indicted, the Depression will continue.

 Actually they do NOT ([638]0+ / 0-)

   have an absolute right to print "anything".

   18 U.S.C. § 793 : US Code - Section 793: Gathering, transmitting or
   losing defense information

   They don't have the right to print anything about munitions (including
   the storage of), or about anything that could negatively impact
   national defense.

   This story was about the fact that the U.S. had intercepted  and was
   storing a bomb, with the added benefit of exposing both an operation
   and operatives who were in danger of being murdered for their
   participation.

   Specific application of this law in this case differentiates from the
   Pentagon Papers and other leaks that weren't about munitions during a
   time of war and stories that would harm national defense.

   If all they claimed was "national defense", it might be a stretch, but
   it exposed the infiltration of terrorist groups being done in
   furtherance of our defense.  And it involved munitions.

   And it basically states that if Kim is guilty of leaking under this
   law, then the person he leaked to is also guilty.

 The Supreme Court is clear: ([642]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [643]KayCeSF

   that you don't have the right to publish just anything you want
   concerning classified documents.

   And the Espionage Act itself has no press exception--- in any legal
   sense, soliciting classified information is like having someone steal
   jewels for you, and Mr Rosen was violating the law.  By any letter of
   the law, Mr Rosen is a co-conspirator in a crime.

   Now, the government goes easy on reporters, mindful of the public
   interest in protecting a free press (and mindful of the bad PR of doing
   something like this).  Indeed, in this case, you'll notice that they
   didn't actually charge Mr Rosen in the end, despite his flagrant
   violations of the Espionage Act.  And they publicly asked for a
   warrant, which, with FISA, they didn't really need to do.  If that's
   not going easy on journalists, what is?

   Compare that to what's going on with Julian Assange, who, as a webhost,
   is not given the privileges of the press.  And even then, Assange isn't
   on record as saying his primary motivation was to scoop his
   competition.

   There is the balance between security and free speech.  Just like
   there's one between security and the right to bear arms.  And the same
   for the rest of our Constitutional rights. The balance is never at one
   far end or the other, but somewhere in the middle, and from what I've
   seen, it's pretty close to the middle.

       As for the Pentagon Papers, the choice to prosecute Neil Sheehan

       level of charging the journalist.   But, as the SCOTUS has

       Sometimes the evidence obtained by the search warrant results in no

       evidence wasn't as clear-cut as the DOJ needed to bring charges
       against Rosen.  A search warrant is a device to collect evidence,
       not an indictment.

   This leak was not an issue of government corruption it was a national

   Yes, I know we are not at war, but the analogy is still apt.  If
   someone in the FBI or national security apparatus is leaking to the
   press, then the government has a right to investigate and if it cannot
   be discovered in any other way, then they have a right to find out who

     Now, what would make the Obama administration so furious? My guess
     is it wasn't the substance of the AP story that has exasperated the
     government but that the AP found a source or sources that spilled
     information about an ongoing intelligence operation and that even
     grander leaks might surge into the press corps' rain barrels.

       Brennan alone?  Shafer does not come to the same conclusion.
       "But now thanks to Clarke, who was briefed by White House aide
       Brennan, and King, who also claims to have been briefed by the
       White House, the world learned that the underwear bomber plot had
       been undone by a double agent inside al Qaeda in the Arabian
       Peninsula."
       ...
       "Likewise, the next time the CIA or foreign intelligence agency
       tries to recruit a double agent, the candidate will judge his
       handlers wretched secret keepers, regard the assignment a death
       mission and seek employment elsewhere.
       Last, the leaks of information -- including those from the lips of
       Brennan, Clarke and King -- signal to potential allies that America
       can't be trusted with secrets. "Leaks related to national security
       can put people at risk," as Obama put it today in a news
       conference."
       And just to be clear, I still don't think the DOJ should have
       subpoenaed the records.  We need a shield law.
       What I am doing here on Kos is adding facts to the misinformation

       And there's nothing in it that contradicts my point that, if the
       administration is really concerned about leaks, it should be
       concerned about John Brennan, not the AP. See [838]here:

     White House efforts to soft-pedal the danger from a new "underwear
     bomb" plot emanating from Yemen may have inadvertently broken the
     news they needed most to contain.

     At about 5:45 p.m. EDT on Monday, May 7, just before the evening
     newscasts, John Brennan, President Barack Obama's top White House
     adviser on counter-terrorism, held a small, private teleconference
     to brief former counter-terrorism advisers who have become frequent
     commentators on TV news shows.
     According to five people familiar with the call, Brennan stressed
     that the plot was never a threat to the U.S. public or air safety
     because Washington had "inside control" over it.
     Brennan's comment appears unintentionally to have helped lead to
     disclosure of the secret at the heart of a joint U.S.-British-Saudi
     undercover counter-terrorism operation.
       So if there really was a threat to national security, John Brennan
       is responsible.

       O'Brien's morning CNN, much in the way Clarke had shared. Here's
       their exchange:
       O'BRIEN: There was a drone attack that was able to kill Fahd

       attack over the weekend that was by U.S. accounts successful, and

       AP it was OK to run the story. I'm pretty sure the CIA can figure

   The AP withheld publishing the story at the request of the Obama
   administration until after the bomb had been secured.

   From [959]The Laughable Currently Operative AP Pushback Story:

     So the government rolled up the plot in April -- almost certainly by
     April 24 -- and then the AP came to the CIA and White House with
     their story about a foiled plot on May 2.

     It's that timing that undermines the claim that the government still
     hoped to use the mole to get at Ibrahim al-Asiri. Because to
     maintain that claim, you'd have to explain how an AQAP operative who
     had been entrusted with the latest version of Ibrahim al-Asiri's
     UndieBomb sometime in early April, had left (at least as far as
     Sanaa), had not apparently succeeded in his mission (which was,
     after all, meant to be a suicide bombing), could return to AQAP
     without the UndieBomb and infiltrate even further than he had the
     first time.

     "Oh, hi, AQAP gatekeeper" -- their story must imagine the mole
     saying as he returned to AQAP -- "I've both failed in my mission and
     somehow lost the bomb you gave me, but based on that would you be
     willing to let me spend some quality time with even higher-ranking
     AQAP operatives?"

     The government must believe AQAP has far worse counterintelligence
     than Asiri's longevity would seem to suggest. Alternately, they're
     just inventing stories right now to justify their seizure.

 Um, emptywheel makes no sense ([963]0+ / 0-)
       As John Brennan's case proves, failing upwards happens all the
       time.  It's human psychology at work, and any reasonable person is
       aware of that.  "Shit floats," as the saying goes.  Why would
       failing upwards not happen in Al-Qaeda, too?
       In the history of moles, in espionage, organized crime, and war,
       it's very normal to come up with a plausible backstory about why
       the mission failed.  People do that all the time, even when they're
       not moles--- BS'ing away failure is a normal human trait.
       Emptywheel's glib suppositions are naïve with a veneer of
       worldliness.   I wouldn't put too much stock into them.  And
       speaking of failing upwards, I see this epic fail of a post being

       defense.  So I'll just copy and paste what I wrote to you [972]the
       last time you trotted this out:
       "You do realize that what she wrote there is simply taking the
       logic put forth by the administration to its logical conclusion?  A
       supposed suicide bomber, who is supposed to wearing the bomb, is
       going to be able to say that he was stymied?  Seriously?  The only
       way to be stymied when one is wearing the bomb is to be detected at
       security or to be on the plane and try to blow up the bomb and the
       bomb doesn't work, either of which would have garnered an enormous
       amount of press.
       And the operation was not blown by the AP.  By public statements,
       which many people, including emptywheel, have linked to, the mole
       was already out of the country and the perpetrator of the Undiebomb
       plot had been killed before the AP printed its story, as it had
       held the printing for several days upon request by the
       administration.  In fact, as emptywheel, among others, has pointed
       out, John Brennan himself had already publicly claimed that the
       plot was under control because there was a mole on the inside well
       before the AP printed its story."

 It's not its logical conclusion, ([977]0+ / 0-)
       unless you have no sense of human psychology.  That's why it's
       naïve.
       It's well known that even failed suicide bombers are welcomed back
       for all sorts of reasons (one being the scarcity of volunteers).
       If the 9/11 conspirators had failed for whatever reason, they
       wouldn't have been cut off either.  The assumptions that emptywheel
       makes despite a lack of basic knowledge is also naïve.
       Also, I didn't diss the ACLU, I dissed your

       about this; I don't always agree with them just because they're the

       As for your civil "study" of human psychology, as I noted above, it
       civilly leaves out the fact that what you describe is impossible.
       The only ways for the Undiebomb to have failed is for the
       Undiebomber to have been caught at airport security or to have
       tried to detonate the bomb on the plane and the bomb didn't go off,
       in which case he also would have been detained.  So either way he
       would have been detained and then brought to trial and there would

       can be summed up in one other question:
       Can you point me to the spot in the Constitution where security
       trumps the right to bear arms?
       The fact is, the risk to security has always led to restrictions on
       the first amendment concerning classified information, depending on
       the nature of the risk and the motivation of the publication.  (see
       Near v Minnesota, cited in NY Times v US, and also see Schenck v
       US.)
       And is it spying on someone to ask a judge for a warrant to search
       their records pursuant to a criminal investigation, then searching
       their records?  The judge approved the warrant, in line with the
       4th amendment.
       I know it's easy to get upset about "spying on the press", but this
       wasn't spying on the press.  This was a routine investigation of a
       leak of classified information.  I don't see why they wouldn't
       check Mr Rosen's phone records once they knew he'd been frequenting
       the suspected leaker.

       appeal-to-authority fallacies. You'll have to try harder than that.
       But let me get this straight... the FBI, in pursuing leaks of
       sensitive information, watched the door of the State Department to
       see who went in about the time the suspected leaker was leaking
       documents.
       Of course, you have to wonder how a police state would let people
       just walk right into their buildings to read their secret
       documents.
       What this means is that in the future, reporters will have to meet
       their leakers away from the leaker's office. OH NO!!!!
       And... they got a warrant to search his e-mails, in regards to
       violations of the Espionage Act... a judge agreed to it, and that
       is the hallmark of tyranny?

       cited Rosen as "an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator" (point
       5, page 3)
        I don't think anyone would dispute that Mr Rosen was aiding and
       abetting this violation of 18 USC s 793(d).  As it happens, 18 USC
       s 793(g) says that conspiracy to violate 793(d) is punishable by
       the same punishment as 793(d) (the same way getaway drivers are
       punished the same as the robbers).  In that sense, being an aider
       and abettor may make him a co-conspirator.
       Now, whether he was a co-conspirator would depend on the evidence,
       and that's what the warrant-seekers sought to seek. With a warrant.
       A judge found suitable probable cause to accept the warrant.
       Now, as the affidavit also points out, the Privacy Protection Act
       specifically protects journalists from this kind of prosecution...
       UNLESS the act they abetted was a violation of 18 USC 793(d).

       can say with a fairly high degree of confidence that had Nixon done

 You also ought to read this fascinating account ([1053]0+ / 0-)
       of Nixon's decision-making in the Pentagon Papers affair:
       [1054]Nixon tapes on the Pentagon Papers
       What emerges is that Nixon decided to go after the entire Times
       newspaper, instead of the individual journalist, so as to prevent
       publication of what had already been leaked.   The SCOTUS nixed the
       publication ban in their NY Times v US decision. They said nothing
       about the actual violation of the Espionage Act.
       In doing so, SCOTUS upheld the first judge's decision on the case.
        He was a recent Nixon appointee, and refused to grant an
       injunction on the material, on the grounds that this was not worth
       banning:

     No cogent reasons were advanced as to why these documents except in
     the general framework of embarrassment... would vitally affect the
     security of the nation."
       That is to say--- the Pentagon Papers were very embarrassing but
       did not endanger our national security.  So they got a pass.
       As well they should have: The Pentagon Papers detailed how multiple
       administrations lied and cheated us into the Vietnam War, and
       undermined governments overseas. (When the Bush administration lied
       us into Iraq, they made sure not to leave the evidence behind).
       Now, the Rosen leak did nothing but tell North Korea we had spies
       who'd leaked to us what their plans would be if we put on
       sanctions. [1055]This is the article in question.  That's nothing
       worth breaking the law for.  Now, given the speed with which we
       found our leaker once we knew there was a leak, even with warrants
       and due process, imagine how fast the North Koreans found their
       leaker.  And of course, their spies they execute their spies
       forthwith, and ship their entire families off to labor camps. I'm
       sure that while they're enjoying their scoop of gruel after a
       grueling day at backbreaking work, they'll take consolation in the
       fact that at least Mr Rosen got his scoop.
       The fact is, the crime isn't reporting or publishing the
       information.  That isn't at issue. The crime was leaking the
       information, and the reporter helped that crime happen by
       soliciting it.  The DOJ asserted that nature of the information
       voided the reporter's protections under the Privacy Protection Act,
       and a judge agreed enough to permit the warrant. Those are all
       facts.  You say "it cannot be a crime, because magic press badge."
       Well, I've pointed out the law to you, and just saying "it can't
       be" doesn't change the fact that according to the laws passed by
       the legislative branch, signed and carried out by the executive
       branch, and repeatedly upheld by the judicial branch, it is illegal
       to solicit classified information that damages our national
       security.
       Fun footnote: Frustrated by the inability to ban the publication of
       the Pentagon Papers, Nixon then set up his "plumber" squad to
       illegally dig up dirt to discredit Ellsberg (the leaker). This
       squad would later get caught breaking into the DNC's Watergate
       headquarters.  Obama has not stooped nearly so low.

 I don't think there is any way to cut this ([1059]0+ / 0-)
       Gordian knot.
       Rosen reported that North Korea planned to respond to renewed
       sanctions by testing more nuclear weapons. I didn't need a spy in
       Pyongyang to be able to make that prediction - I think it falls
       under the purview of the Department of the Obvious. So I think the
       claim that Rosen's article somehow damaged national security is
       somewhat  akin to waving the post-9-11 bloody shirt.
       You write a couple very interesting sentences:

     The fact is, the crime isn't reporting or publishing the
     information.  That isn't at issue. The crime was leaking the
     information, and the reporter helped that crime happen by soliciting
     it.
       Well, there's a school of thought that says that "soliciting"
       information -- classified or otherwise -- from reluctant sources is
       the job of investigative journalists. Rosen was targeted for
       engaging in behavior common to many investigative journalists, Neil
       Sheehan not least among them.
       Speaking of Nixon's motivations in seeking to quash publication of
       the PP, hope you've read Robert Parry's recent article on why Nixon
       so feared the PP - acc. to Parry, Nixon feared that the PP that
       hadn't been published but that Ellsberg might control contained
       documentation of his treason vis-a-vis the 1968 Paris peace talks.
       That evidence existed but Ellsberg didn't have it. Instead, LBJ
       aide Walt Rostow had it and donated it to the LBJ Library (in a
       file called "The X Enveleope"). Fascinating stuff, even if not
       really germane to this thread:

 I've read the ACLU statement... ([1064]0+ / 0-)

   (thanks for the link!)  ...and I disagree, as you might have guessed.
   Frankly, the fear that the law could apply to innocent questions is so
   overblown as to practically ludicrous.

     That would, quite literally, make virtually any question by a
     reporter implicating classified information a potential felony.

   Umm, no.  Asking a question and getting an answer, especially in an
   adversarial context like a press briefing, does not mean that you and
   the answerer "conspire to violate [793(d)]".  Any judge would laugh
   such a contention out of court.  It's clear from the affidavit that Mr
   Rosen did much more than just ask questions. That's why the FBI went to
   a judge, and the judge not only didn't laugh them out of court, but
   also found probable cause for a search warrant.

   Now, I'll grant the part about not disclosing the search could probably
   have been avoided, but it's hardly a chilling step towards tyranny.
   The guidelines of notifying the press within 90 days after searches
   (which wouldn't exist if the searches never happened before) can be
   strengthened a bit.

   But then, Mr Rottman then says that we should accept "bad" speech as
   the price for "good" speech.  And he's right.  But Mr Rosen's
   revelation wasn't "bad" speech, it was needlessly dangerous speech, and
   that has never been protected, and shouldn't be.  This isn't the Nazis
   in Skokie, or the Westboro folks at a soldier's funeral.  This is
   shouting fire in a crowded theater when there is no fire -- it puts
   people in danger and has no public benefit.

 I've now read the affidavit. I think the judge ([1068]0+ / 0-)

   and perhaps you yourself have fallen victim to the 'intentional
   fallacy' (an idea borrowed from my days in graduate school in literary
   criticism).

   Basically, the 'intentional fallacy' argues that one cannot necessarily
   impute intent to any written first-person utterance. The 'I' in any
   written work is a constructed persona with aims and intentions that may
   not necessarily coincide with the aims and intentions of the real
   author behind it. One can never 'know' definitively the intent of any
   author of any piece of writing.

   To ground this in the specifics of this affidavit (itself citing
   portions of a May 22, 2009 email, wherein Rosen employs the nom de
   plume of 'Alex' and Kim is given the name 'Leo'):

     Thanks Leo. What I am interested in, as you might expect, is
     breaking news ahead of my competitors . . . . In short, let's break
     some news, and expose muddle-headed policy when we see it - or force
     the administration to go in the right direction, if possible. The
     only way to do this is to EXPOSE (sic) the policy . . . and the only
     way to do that authoritatively is with EVIDENCE. (sic)

   One of the ways investigative journalists operate is to appeal to the
   source's heroic self-imaging of himself and we can see that the real
   Rosen is doing this by asking Kim to "EXPOSE . . . with EVIDENCE." You
   can rightly object that investigative journalists seduce their sources
   by such patently obvious ploys but that has never been against the
   criminal laws of this country.

   To continue along this line of 'intentional fallacy,' one might impute
   that when the "I" in the email says "Let's break some news" that the
   real Rosen is conspiring with Kim. But again, one can counter-argue
   that Rosen has created the persona of a 'crusader' making common cause
   with Kim when the real Rosen's interest comes in the very first
   sentence ("breaking news ahead of my competitors").

   I am having a devil of a time finding a version of this affidavit on
   line that will load easily over my wireless connection and that allows
   me to copy and paste, so had to type the foregoing excerpt free-hand.
   As a result, I may be missing a portion of the affidavit that you
   consider essential to this case. If so, can you please indicate what
   portions (or even page numbers) if any I should be reading?

   For more on how journalists interact with, seduce and otherwise secure
   cooperation from their sources, I cannot recommend highly enough Janet
   Malcolm's seminal 1990 book The Journalist and the Murderer (about
   journalist Joe McGinniss and convicted murderer Jeffrey MacDonald). The
   book should be required reading for anyone seeking to criminalize the
   behavior of journalists. The wiki below is a great place to start if

       to consider that you, by agreeing with this judge's issuance of the
       warrant, are agreeng that the gathering of news is itself a
       criminal offense.
       To quote from the ACLU:

     What's astonishing here is that never before has the government
     argued that newsgathering--in this case, asking a source to provide
     sensitive information--is itself illegal. That would, quite
     literally, make virtually any question by a reporter implicating
     classified information a potential felony. The logic behind the
     FBI's warrant application would extend even to a reporter asking a
     question at a public press briefing at the CIA, Pentagon, or State
     Department. If the question is designed to elicit the disclosure of
     classified information, and prompts that disclosure, I don't see how

       protecting the edges of the envelope (they do much more than that,
       but protecting the edges is one of the things they do), but that
       doesn't make it the law, nor does it make the ACLU the arbiter of
       the law.  The law is determined by judges and it is what it is, not
       what the ACLU wishes it were.
       I take it that you still haven't read the affidavit.  All the DOJ
       needs is probable cause, which isn't a particularly high standard.
        A Federal Judge determined that the strictures of the Fourth
       Amendment were met and issued the search warrant.  The DOJ gathered
       its evidence and ultimately decided not to bring charges against
       Rosen.  Police work is like that -- there are times when the
       evidence collected under a search warrant is inconsistent with
       bringing an indictment, and it looks like this case is one of those
       times.
       At this point, the warrant is valid and there is no process by
       which to test that determination.  There is no Art. III case or
       controversy here because the DOJ's decision not to bring charges
       renders the matter moot.  If the DOJ changes its mind and does
       bring charges, then Rosen can challenge the evidence obtained under
       the warrant.  He'll lose, and appeal, lose again and the the
       Supreme Court will deny cert.  The Espionage Act is pretty broad
       and has been upheld many times.
       And, hey, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong and I'll write a diary that says
       "CharlesInCharge was right about the Rosen case and I was wrong."
       So far, I'm not sharpening my pencil.
       And by the way, I've represented the ACLU on a couple of occasions
       in my career on matters involving civil liberties, so I'll tout my
       credentials however I please.

   Had the judge agreed with you, he/she would have denied the warrant.

       ooh you got me.  Now maybe some other snarky jerk can explain why
       congress can't repeal or amend old laws that they feel are being
       abused.
       There's also the broader context of so many people here making
       Holder the scapegoat not only for this, but for the AP issue and
       others that don't just involve the Espionage Act, but FISA and the
       Patriot Act, as well as the Obama Administration's overrarching
       agressive posture towards anyone they view as leaking national
       security information.
       But go ahead, blame Holder for all these problems and act as if
       anything will change with the next AG the president chooses, or the
       current congress.  I highly doubt anything would change even if the
       Dems retake the House.
       I understand the anger at Holder for not prosecuting the bankers
       and the war criminals, but again, that was part of Obama's
       philosophy of "moving on" and "what's done is done" bullshit, as
       well as his conscious decision to populate his adminstration with
       Wall Street whores--Holder is just one of many.

       My apology for not specifying that.
       Of course Congress is responsible for the laws it passes and it's
       foolish to lay the blame for those laws on the executive.
       It's also true that the executive has, especially since 9/11, great
       latitude in executing those laws.  I think one reason people are
       looking so hard at the White House and DoJ on this (and other)
       issues is due to Congress's abdication of its historic role and the
       enormous expansion of executive power over the last decade plus.
       The Obama administration has done little to limit that expansion,
       which I think you allude to.  In fact, quite the opposite.  When
       power is abused, you look to those using the power abusively.
       That's why the executive bears so much scrutiny here.
       I personally don't see AG Holder as a deserving scapegoat, he's all
       of a piece with the administration he works for.
       If I haven't answered you adequately, please let me know what else
       I can address.

   Fox News absolutely is, as you say, a propaganda distribution channel.
    But under the First Amendment (which rightly considers neither motive
   nor accuracy in evaluating a speaker's right to free speech), Fox is
   absolutely entitled to protection from government harrassment like

       The president chose him and has kept him on into his second term,

       In fact, I've not seen much to indicate that Holder hasn't done
       exactly what the president would have done regarding most of these
       issues--from going easy on Wall Street and the Bush administration
       war criminals, to the agressive approach to leaks, to you name it.

       If you don't like what the administration is doing here, change the

   issues in this overall matter of the administration's going after
   whistleblowers, leakers and the media under the guise of protecting
   national security.

   One, that it's doing it not just at all, but to the extent and with the
   ferocity that it is, which we haven't seen since Nixon and J Edgar
   Hoover, and why.

   And two, whether and to what extent it's doing this in a constitutional
   manner, irregardless of whatever legal cover the Patriot Act and FISA
   and various legal findings give it, which may or may not be
   constitutionally valid.

   I have issues with both aspects of this matter. So should we all. If
   there are legitimate national security concerns then obviously the
   administration can and should pursue them, but only in a constitutional
   manner. But if it's doing this to intimidate the media and
   whistleblowers, and/or in an unconstitutional way, then shame on
   it--and shame on us for defending it, and not criticizing it.

   Obama is better than that. Or so I wanted to believe.

       Eric Holder isn't acting on his own in torturing whistleblowers,
       pursing our sacred war against MaryJane, or intimidating the press,

       it would seem to me that monitoring who the Justice Department is
       issuing subpoenas to would be a tremendous waste of any president's
       valuable time. I'd assume than intelligent one wouldn't really give
       a shit about some reporter at Fox News or who is intimidating him.
       I suspect a more accurate (and less conspiratorial) view is that
       the President wants the leaks stopped and just delegated the matter
       to Holder to handle as he sees fit. What and how and the
       particulars wouldn't strike me as something any president would be
       interested in knowing. Especially one with as many things to juggle
       as this one.
       My view is that Holder has bungled things, overreaching when it
       wasn't necessary and fumbling the ball all on his own.

       From [1728]emptywheel:

     In other words, during a period from May 2010 through January 2011,
     Eric Holder's DOJ was developing this theory under which journalists
     were criminals, though it's just now that we're all noticing this
     May 2010 affidavit that lays the groundwork for that theory.

     Maybe that development was predictable, given that during precisely
     that time period, the lawyer who fucked up the Ted Stevens
     prosecution, William Welch, was in charge of prosecuting leaks
     (though it's not clear he had a role in Kim's prosecution before he
     left in 2011).
     But it's worth noting the strategy -- and the purpose it serves --
     because it is almost certainly still in effect. FBI Special Agent
     Reginald Reyes accused Rosen of being a criminal so he could get
     around the Privacy Protection Act protections for media work product
     (See pages 4 and following), which specifically exempts "fruits of a
     crime" or "property ... used [] as a means of committing a criminal
     offense." Then he further used it to argue against giving notice to
     Fox or Rosen.

       the DOJ is invoking an exception to the media protections in the
       Privacy Protection Act:

     But it's worth noting the strategy -- and the purpose it serves --
     because it is almost certainly still in effect. FBI Special Agent
     Reginald Reyes accused Rosen of being a criminal so he could get
     around the Privacy Protection Act protections for media work product
     (See pages 4 and following), which specifically exempts "fruits of a
     crime" or "property ... used [] as a means of committing a criminal
     offense." Then he further used it to argue against giving notice to
     Fox or Rosen.

         Because of the Reporter's own potential criminal liability in
     this matter, we believe that requesting the voluntary production of
     the materials from Reporter would be futile and would pose a
     substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation and of the
     evidence we seek to obtain by the warrant. (29)
     While the AP's phone records weren't taken via a warrant, it would
     be unsurprising if the government is still using this formula --
     journalists = criminals and therefore cannot have notice -- to
     collect evidence. Indeed, that may be one reason why we haven't seen
     the subpoena to the AP.
     Of course, this is not just about journalists. In this schema,
     providing information about what our government is doing in our name
     to citizens constitutes a crime.
     This criminalization of journalism is a fundamentally
     anti-democratic stance.
       [1753]http://www.emptywheel.net/...
       So the issue is not whether or not they got a warrant, but why, not
       just in the case of Rosen but in other cases as well, the DOJ is
       invoking the same formula of journalists as criminals to eviscerate
       the media protections.

   Apparently Rosen stated his intent as being to influence politics,
   rather than to report.

   I.e., he was not acting as a journalist, but a political operative.

   Apparently a Bush appointed judge agreed and granted the warrant.

   what they're doing is highly illegal.  The Espionage Act specifies
   this, and so does common sense--- if you get someone to steal jewelry
   and give it to you, you're committing a crime.  The same goes for
   classified information.  If you don't believe me, you're welcome to try
   yourself.

   The Supreme Court has written out exceptions for journalists when the
   illegally-leaked information is the public interest.  But if the
   information is not in the public interest, then what? Does it make a
   difference that the publication of this information taught the public
   little it needed to know? Does it matter that the journalist made it
   clear in these e-mails that his goal was merely to scoop his
   competition?

   Also, the SCOTUS specifically does not make exceptions when the
   illegally-leaked information is dangerous to national security.  Do we
   just say "aw, whatever, who cares if our spy network in North Korea is
   compromised by the revelation that we're getting classified information
   from them"? Or "Who cares if it's harder to get spies on the ground
   because they can't trust us to keep their identities secret, even
   though after 9/11 one of the weakest points in our intelligence was the
   lack of spies on the ground?"

   These buzzword clichés going around, "criminalizing journalism" or
   "chilling effect", would be distressing if that's what the Obama
   administration were actually doing.  But I've yet to see any evidence
   that they are.  They're just chipping away at immunity privileges the
   press are, quite frankly, abusing, if this is all they manage to do
   with it.

       that the Reporter has committed or is committing a violation of
       section 793(d), as an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator, to

       What is section 793(d), you ask? Well, here's the copy-and-paste
       from [1886]findlaw:

     (d) Whoever, lawfully having possession of, access to, control
     over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code
     book,signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative,
     blueprint,plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating
     to the national defense, or information relating to the national
     defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could
     be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of

     causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to
     communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated,
     delivered or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to
     receive it,
       So far, this applies especially to the leaker... but we're not
       done:

     or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to
     the officer or employee of the United States entitled
       The affidavit then notes section (g) of the same act:

     (g) If two or more persons conspire to violate any of the foregoing
     provisions of this section, and one or more of such persons do any
     act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each of the parties to
     such conspiracy shall be subject to the punishment provided for the
     offense which is the object of such conspiracy.
       The offense for violating section (d) is up to ten years'
       imprisonment.
       You can read the whole affidavit here; it's quite the lurid tale:
       [1887]the affidavit
       Now, you might say: But this is a journalist!  Well, read on: The
       Privacy Protection Act specifically protects journalists, unless
       "there is probable cause to believe that the person possessing such
       materials has committed or is committing the criminal offense to
       which the materials relate:"
        Then, the affidavit makes its case for probable cause... and a
       judge found there to be probable cause.  Spreading secrets is a
       crime.  We let it pass sometimes if it serves a public interest,
       but it doesn't always (in this case, the reporter pointed out, the
       goal was to scoop his competition, and we didn't learn much of
       interest. Certainly not enough to warrant tipping off the North
       Koreans, who not only execute spies but ship their families off to
       labor camps.  I'm sure they'll appreciate Mr Rosen's scoop.)

   At minimum, this is horrible public relations for the Obama
   administration.

   Democrats aren't going to like this any more than Republicans.

   At most, this shows a blatant disregard for traditions of the free
   press in this country and a sniveling, cowardly sort of power play that
   we have a right not to expect from the Executive.

   The truth is probably somewhere in between:

   Real necessity to investigate improper behavior within government, poor
   judgment on the part of Holder and Justice Department lawyers and some
   level power insecurity going to the top of the White House itself.

   Recommended by:

   as long as there is in fact evidence that the journalist may have
   participated in breaking the law.  There cannot be blanket protection
   for criminal activity for no other reason that they're members of the
   press.

   If it turns out that the DOJ sought these records from the press only
   in connection with investigation (and not a suspect in the
   investigation), then I do have a problem with that.

   Of course, we don't know what evidence the DOJ presented to the judge
   who approved the search warrant, so we have  no way to decide ourselves
   if the warrant was truly justified or not.

   This from the diary confuses me

     It doesn't matter that Rosen hasn't been charged with a crime--the
     fact is that the search warrant accused him of criminal acts without
     giving him chance to respond to it before it was executed.

   As a matter of procedure (not necessarily with this case) is it normal
   for law enforcement to tell a suspect that they're going to be hit with
   a search warrant?  Wouldn't that tip off a suspect that they'd better
   get rid of the "evidence"?  This statement doesn't make sense to me.

       The DOJ has asserted that Risen, who is a real dick by the way,

       How is this true?
       That is what I object to.  It is fine to go after the leaker
       (although we allow the government to over-classify out the ass).
       What I am saying is you can't spy on a reporters communications
       because someone else leaked to him/her wihout any due process.
       You can, as in the case you cited below, compel a journalist to
       disclose his/her source.  This, as the court wrote, is on a case by
       case basis and the journalist is only required to appear before a
       grand jury if he/she has information that could not be obtained in
       other ways.  The test in legaleze is

     convincingly show a substantial relation between the information
     sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest.
       So if the DOJ would have subpoenaed Risen to testify who his source
       was then the court would have had to evaluate that test.   They
       didn't do that, they seized his phone/email records of his source
       in this AND ALL OTHERS.  That is what I object to.

   Even if James Rosen has not been charged with a crime (and caution,
   there may be a sealed indictment), absolutely nothing prevents
   obtaining a search warrant for his e-mails and correspondence.

   I happen to believe - and I expect to be in minority here on this point
   - that it was gutsy for AG Holder to sign or "sign off on" that
   warrant. He was standing up for (1) the importance of the warrant, and
   (2) not ducking the certain firestorm associated with a unusually but
   not unprecedented search of a reporter.

   The point of a warrant is that the object of it need not - often,
   should not - have "a chance to defend itself." (I believe the law is
   that warrants are not required to be disclosed where, for example, the
   issuing judge accepts that disclosure will lead to destruction of
   evidence.)

   What commenters and the President are suggesting is that the press is
   different. In an open democracy, we should be heavily invested in full
   disclosure, whistle blowing and diligent investigative reporting.
   (Note: it is immaterial but nevertheless ironic that Fox News is not
   known for these traits.)

     So: Are there instances when members of the media can be subject -
     under the right circumstances, which might/should/must be few and
     far between - to normal criminal law processes?

   If the answer is No Never, it will make new law.

   If the answer is Yes, But, there is more to know before we pillory the
   Attorney General.

   [note: This is my understanding of long-standing criminal law, but I am
   not delivering legal advice here. The issues, I'm arguing, are policy
   issues that deserve something better than knee-jerk responses.]

       or the mere fact that they got a warrant to search Rosen's
       communications. The problem is that, to get the warrant, the
       government argued that it was okay to be going through Rosen's
       stuff because he may have been a co-conspirator. That's a dangerous
       argument that Holder put his name to.

       Warrants necessarily come before the person is proven guilty,

       NO-WHERE does it argue that the reporter's political aims relate to
       the classification of his involvement as a crime.
       In particular, paragraph 39 on page 26 is a point-by-point summary
       of the facts leading to the conclusion that Rosen may have
       committed a crime. His intent is never mentioned.
       You may think that being a Fox News hack disqualifies Rosen from
       First amendment protections, but the Justice Department apparently
       does not. Hell, apparently the fact that Rosen "employ[ed] flattery
       and play[ed] to Mr. Kim's vanity and ego" was more material to the
       co-conspirator charge than Rosen's political aims.

       he's charged with breaking:
       You might not agree with the law but it says this:

     (a) Whoever, for the purpose of obtaining information respecting
     the national defense with intent or reason to believe that the
     information is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to
     the advantage of any foreign nation . . . obtains information
     concerning any  . . .  place in which any  . . .
     arms, munitions, or other materials or instruments for use in time
     of war are being made, prepared, repaired, stored, or are the
     subject of research or development,  . . . or

     (b) Whoever, for the purpose aforesaid, and with like intent or
     reason to believe, copies, takes, makes, or obtains, or attempts to
     copy, take, make, or obtain, any sketch, photograph, photographic
     negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance,
     document, writing, or note of anything connected with the national
     defense; or
     (c) Whoever, for the purpose aforesaid, receives or obtains or
     agrees or attempts to receive or obtain from any person, or from any
     source whatever, any document, writing, code book, signal book,
     sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map,
     model, instrument, appliance, or note, of anything connected with
     the national defense, knowing or having reason to believe, at the
     time he receives or obtains, or agrees or attempts to receive or
     obtain it, that it has been or will be obtained, taken, made, or
     disposed of by any person contrary to the provisions of this
     chapter; or
     (d) or
     (e) Whoever having unauthorized possession of, access to, or
     control over any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch,
     photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model,
     instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or
     information relating to the national defense which information the
     possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the
     United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully
     communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated,
     delivered, or transmitted, or attempts to communicate, deliver,
     transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the
     same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains
     the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the
     United States entitled to receive it; or
     ( . . .
     (g) If two or more persons conspire to violate any of the
     foregoing provisions of this section, and one or more of such
     persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each of
     the parties to such conspiracy shall be subject to the punishment
     provided for the offense which is the object of such conspiracy.
       So, basically Mr. Kim can be prosecuted for leaking a secret that
       he knew could bring harm to the U.S. and involving the location of
       munitions, namely by exposing operatives helping the U.S. foil bomb
       plots by revealing we had intercepted a bomb and were holding it in
       a specific place.
       And they are claiming Rosen became a co-conspirator to Mr. Kim when
       he then communicated the information to us.
       So yes, his intent is important, but more important is that the
       affidavit focuses on a specific law (18 U.S.C. § 793 : US Code -
       Section 793: Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information)
       in claiming Mr. Rosen may be engaged in criminal activity.
       The Pentagon Papers didn't tell anyone where we were holding
       munitions.

       The government charges that Rosen broke the law not because he
       obtained and disseminated classified information for political
       purposes but because he did so at all.
       And the interpretation of the Espionage Act to apply to
       investigative reporting -- even politically motivated such -- is
       novel. Not even Nixon claimed the NYT broke the law by obtaining

 Wrong ([2357]0+ / 0-)
       They say he broke the law because the law specifically prohibits
       leaking information on MUNITIONS.
       The leak was about MUNITIONS.
       Specifically about MUNITIONS.
       The law is clear on that.  It has the word MUNITIONS in it.
       The leak was about the U.S. having intercepted a BOMB (which is a
       type of MUNITION).
       In no event is it legal to leak information about MUNITIONS.
       And the law states that anyone who receives that information (about
       MUNITIONS) and disseminates it is guilty of the same crime.
       No, I did not make your point for you.  Had the leak been about
       someone lying about a break in, or a document stating that the
       government knew a decade earlier that a war could not be won, this
       law would not apply.  Because those are not about MUNITIONS.

       Why was he so eager to report on this stuff?  He made it clear in
       his communications with Kim that he would take just about anything
       Kim had to offer, for political purposes - pushing the president in
       a particular direction.
       Then, because he was so eager and so cajoling with Kim, Kim hands
       over information that the government now alleges was illegal to
       hand over.
       What was his intention?  To expose some great wrong?  To make sure
       the government didn't get away with some lies or misbehavior?
       To put a stop to nasty CIA stuff like intercepting bombs meant for
       Americans?  And the rare infiltration of terrorist organizations?
       Why did he sit on Kim for so long, grasping at the smallest straw?
        Why was he so dogged?
       Because he has an agenda.  And his agenda put people in danger.
       Because he reported without thinking.
       If you want to argue that the law that prevents people from telling
       the world about our weapons and defense apparatus is a bad law, or

   Reading the law to restrict information about foreign munitions is
   actually a stretch.  In what sense are foreign munitions part of  "the
   national defense"?

   But, that said, the Espionage Act of 1917 was deliberately written to

       mentions "storage" of weapons.
       Yes, you can argue that the intent was to keep folks from talking
       about the weapons we have, where they are, what we are developing.
       In that case, though, it proves that journalists do not have carte
       blanche to report "anything" with impunity.
       In this case reporting that we had the bomb was actually reporting
       that we had infiltrated a terrorist group, putting the work we were
       doing and the operatives involved in danger.
       Whether you want to take a stand on that hill is up to you.
       Personally I find exposing the government lying to us or covering
       up crimes a much more compelling case to shore up shield laws, than
       this assclown trying to goad Obama by putting people in harms way.
        How does knowing we've intercepted a bomb via a mole affect our
       lives as American citizens to the extent that we need to put people
       in danger over it?

   Recommended by:

   ... Holder to have done so. And politically correct, not reprehensible.
   Holder was right to put his name to the document, and not duck
   responsibility by assigning it to someone else. We know who's
   accountable.

   Unless your view is that there is no circumstance where a "secret"
   warrant can ever be issued against a member of the media, then Holder's
   involvement was appropriate.

   The critics must be mindful that two branches of government were
   directly involved. Representations were made by prosecutors. A Federal
   judge considered them and issued the warrants.

   Two considerations: the warrants were issued in 2010, and the State
   Department employee accused of disclosing national security matters was
   charged with a crime. (It is the court's tardy unsealing of the
   warrants that has generated the current publicity.)

   It may well be that further investigation and review of the case as it
   was being prepared for prosecution did not establish the reporter's
   active involvement as a "co-conspirator" or other kind of participant
   in the alleged crime. Or, that the prosecutor used his/her discretion
   not to charge the reporter. These kinds of field decisions are not
   unknown to criminal law.

        Recommended by:
                [2407]Tony Situ

       1.The phrase - the Reporter "asked, solicited and encouraged Mr.
       Kim to disclose"  sensitive information, including defense
       intelligence information.
       2. The nature of the potential criminal charges against the
       reporter as "a co-conspirator and/or aider and abettor."
       3. The agent's representations (in para. 45) why he believed
       "voluntary production ... would be futile..." and "pose a
       substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation and of the
       evidence we seek to obtain by the warrant." Those are, to me, valid
       reasons for sealing the warrant.
       As to your concerns, I'm thinking the government is conceding that
       the Reporter is a member of the media and his intent is to call the
       government to task in a way that will scoop his competitors, a
       reasonable journalistic goal. But for me, legitimacy and intent
       don't protect these efforts in this case.
       According to the agent, the Reporter was actively encouraging
       breaches of national security. This is knowing and intentional
       conduct. It is active complicity, whether we characterize it as
       "co-conspiratorial" or just motivated by the desire for a scoop.
       Some of us might say that's how they want investigative reporters
       to be able to act and, accordingly, put them beyond the reach of
       virtually any warrant as was issued in this case. (And,
       inferentially, beyond any criminal culpability.) But I can't say
       that. Reporters who "solicit" breaches of security - and the perp
       was considered a weapons expert, as I recall - should be held
       responsible for what they do. If it's egregious enough, it can
       properly be considered criminal behavior.
       Do we really want such an open society that in the name of a search
       for today's truths, the laws need to encourage journalists to
       exploit vulnerable government officials? Private Manning comes to
       mind. And, if we equate bloggers with journalists for "accepted"
       media, the floodgates are open. The "publisher" will always claim
       higher purpose; must we always accept it?
       Journalists enjoy a high privilege in society. I don't think it
       needs to unbounded for them to function as a "free press."

   Corruption, bad decisions, and doubt about the Obama White House:
   That's all they need to keep their jobs as obstructionists.

   As long as Holder is AG, they can validate their role as

   Holder has to go.  He's a liability.

   On a side note:  This administration is trending towards the same path
   as the Bush Administration.  Public support early, a tight 2nd
   election, and then a horrible 2nd term that completely changed opinions
   against the party.  Democrats were able to take advantage, and there

       As stated by Chief Justice Hughes in Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S.

     While reckless assaults upon public men, and efforts to bring
     obloquy upon those who are endeavoring faithfully to discharge
     official duties, exert a baleful influence and deserve the severest
     condemnation in public opinion, it cannot be said that this abuse is
     greater, and it is believed to be less, than that which
     characterized the period in which our institutions took shape.
     Meanwhile, the administration of government has become more complex,
     the opportunities for malfeasance and corruption have multiplied,
     crime has grown to most serious proportions, and the danger of its
     protection by unfaithful officials and of the impairment of the
     fundamental security of life and property by criminal alliances and
     official neglect, emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and
     courageous press, especially in great cities. The fact that the
     liberty of the press may be abused by miscreant purveyors of scandal
     does not make any the less necessary the immunity of the press from

       If it was Satan was the journalist and Jesus Christ was the leaker,

       there is no special constitutional protection for journalists to
       violate secrecy laws. There is a often used successful defense if
       the leak was in the public interest and exposed government
       malfeasance. That is why Ellsberg was hard to prosecute and Scooter
       Libby was easy to prosecute.

       The court held in the Ellsberg case that the government could not
       go after publishers of information, only the sources of them.
       Here is J. Dougless' concurring opinion with regard to the
       Espionage act being applied to journalists:

     Thus, it is apparent that Congress was capable of, and did,

     There are numerous sets of this material in existence, and they
     apparently are not under any controlled custody. Moreover, the
     President has sent a set to the Congress. We start, then, with a
     case where there already is rather wide distribution of the material
     that is destined for publicity, not secrecy. I have gone over the
     material listed in the in camera brief of the United States. It is
     all history, not future events. None of it is more recent than 1968.
       To get from that to a prohibition on a search warrant for violation
       of secrecy on CURRENT secrets involving nuclear weapons in the
       hands of North Korea takes a huge jump.

 No, a blogger is a journalist ([2566]0+ / 0-)
       By every definition.  They are publishing.  That counts.
       It is completely appropriate for the government to go after those
       who leak classified information to the press.  But the DOJ is
       trying to count the press as co-conspirators and that is not what
       the first amendment is all about.
       Now what the US does, and this certainly didn't start with
       President Obama but continues under him, is over-classify.
       Basically if something may look bad for the US, it is classified
       even if it is not protecting state secrets.
       The FOIA mitigates this a little, but we need a different way to
       classify thing so an objective party can determine things that are
       just embarrassing but not classified or secret.

       I disagree with the ruling in this case, just as many others cited
       in the article have.  There are states that have criminal
       defamation laws, Montana is one of them, but there are not any
       Federal defamation laws.  So in this case it appears to be a civil
       matter since she is sued for money and not by the state for a
       crime.
       I hope she wins on appeal.

 I'm still on the fence about this.. ([2579]0+ / 0-)

   On the one hand, I strongly believe in the freedom of the press.

   On the other, I don't believe that means they can act with impunity.

   Having a 100% get-out-of-jail-free card means anyone could leak
   classified info, and as long as they put it up on a blog, they are
   safe.  Even if putting it up on a blog was the means they used to give
   it to the exact people that are the threat.

   If Rosen is not going to be pursued for criminal charges, and the
   warrant is being used only to build evidence against the leaker, then I
   don't see a problem here.  Rosen may be using a press shield to keep
   his butt out of jail, but that doesn't mean the paper trail he left
   behind can't be used.
