Syria speech: What's next on Obama's to-do list

   By Lateef Mungin, CNN
   updated 10:19 AM EDT, Wed September 11, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Obama stalled the plan of a military strike on Syria
     * He said he would give time for a diplomatic plan to work
     * Obama had called for action after allegations of chemical attacks
       in Syria

   (CNN) -- If you take the long view - and by "long view" we're talking
   10 days -- there have been three distinct paths the United States could
   have taken on Syria.

   First, way back on August 31, President Barack Obama seemed imminently
   close to a strike on President Bashar al-Assad's regime. After Labor
   Day, came a detour toward seeking congressional approval. That effort
   was overwhelmingly met by the public with a "No thanks. We'll pass."
   Then this week, thanks to a remark by Secretary of State John Kerry
   that may or may not have been off the cuff, Obama made a sharp turn --
   toward diplomacy.

   For now, he's sticking with option 3.

   [41]Obama seeks support for attacking Syria while pursuing diplomacy

   During a [42]prime-time speech to the American people Tuesday, Obama
   pressed the pause button on his hard sell for a military strike, and
   said he's waiting to see what kind of viable, verifiable plan Russia
   comes up with for al-Assad to give up his cache of chemical weapons.
   But Obama says he'll keep U.S. forces ready in case al-Assad's
   bluffing. Call it carrot-and-stick diplomacy.
   France offers diplomatic help with Syria
   Is Syria trying to delay an airstrike?
   Russia's diplomatic solution for Syria
   U.N. diplomats focus on Syria

   Here's what's on Obama's to-do list for the coming days.

   Make plans

   Send Secretary of State John Kerry to Geneva on Thursday to meet with
   his Russian counterpart. The hope is that Kerry and Sergey Lavrov can
   draw up a timeline for Syria to hand over all its chemical weapons.

   The bad news: This is a crucial meeting, because the United States and
   Russia haven't always seen eye to eye. Many of the next steps, a White
   House official says, depend on what's agreed upon there.

   The good news: Despite a [43]sometimes icy relationship with Russia,
   Kerry and Lavrov have been able to work well in the past.

   The talks should last two days. If a deal is reached, it's on to the
   United Nations next.

   [44]5 key themes from the Obama speech

   Keep courting

   Keep wooing a[45] lukewarm Congress. Even though Obama asked Congress
   to postpone a vote on military action, the White House will push the
   idea, in case diplomacy fails.

   The bad news: Despite bending the ears of 93 senators and more than 350
   members of the House since Friday, lawmakers weren't flocking to Team
   Obama. A CNN tally showed there was growing dissent in both chambers.

   The good news: Some are slowly coming around. A bipartisan group of
   eight senators is working on an alternative resolution that, according
   to Republican Sen. John McCain, will include "guidelines, reporting
   process and benchmarks that have to be met" before letting the United
   States unleash its military might.

   [46]Read the speech

   Set a deadline

   How long should al-Assad get to comply? In his speech Tuesday night,
   Obama didn't specify.

   The bad news: No one's quite certain. After meeting with Obama on
   Tuesday, Sen. Dick Durbin said the president "asked for some time to
   work things out -- a matter of days into next week." Sen. Carl Levin
   said, "I don't know if he put a specified period on it. He thought it
   could be fairly short." And Kerry said, "The president will decide what
   he thinks is the timeframe that he is prepared to live with."
   A diplomat's perspective on Syria
   Syrian rebels view of a U.S. strike
   Legislating a Syria solution
   Will weapons inspections work?

   The good news: Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said he was
   working on a version of a resolution that would authorize a military
   response if diplomacy doesn't produce an acceptable result in 30 days.

   Delegate to the U.N.

   Obama says this last-ditch diplomacy pitch will give U.N. inspectors
   time to issue their report on the August 21 incident. The United States
   and its allies claim that the al-Assad regime used poison gas on rebel
   strongholds that day, killing more than 1,400 people.
   President Barack Obama approaches the podium in the East Room of the
   White House on Tuesday, September 10, for a speech addressing the
   nation on the justification for possible military action against the
   regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The regime is accused of
   launching a horrific chemical weapons attack in the suburbs of Damascus
   that killed more than 1,400 people. President Barack Obama approaches

   Obama makes his case on Syria Obama makes his case on Syria

   The bad news: On September 1, the United Nations said the report would
   be complete in two or three weeks. Later, it said it didn't know how
   long it'll take.

   The good news: France is pushing for a U.N. Security Council resolution
   that would give Syria 15 days to declare all its chemical weapons,
   according to Reuters.

   Be wary

   Russia has agreed to play middleman to defuse this crisis. Syria says
   it's on board with Russia's offer, and will turn over its chemical
   weapons stockpiles to international control. Obama calls this [47]an
   encouraging sign. But, he warned, "It's too early to tell whether this
   offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime
   keeps its commitments."

   The bad news: It's unclear whether Russia is serious or stalling. On
   Tuesday, Russia canceled a U.N. Security Council meeting that it had
   called, and rejected an initial proposal by France for the framework of
   a resolution.

   The good news: TBD.

   Maintain pressure

   The U.S. military will maintain its "current posture to keep the
   pressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy
   fails," Obama said Tuesday night. This means the aircraft carrier USS
   Nimitz that's in the Red Sea with destroyer ships nearby will stay put.

   The bad news: Russian President Vladimir Putin says that has to change.
   "You can't really ask Syria, or any other country, to disarm
   unilaterally while military action against it is being contemplated,"
   Putin said in an interview with a Russian television network.

   The good news (according to the United States): Kerry said the looming
   threat of a strike will prod Syria to play nice. "Nothing focuses the
   mind like the prospect of a hanging," he told lawmakers Tuesday.

   The bad news (again): A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday
   found 59% of respondents opposing congressional authorization of
   military action, while 72% said American strikes would achieve no
   significant goals.

   CNN's Tom Cohen, Tim Lister, Deidre Walsh, Dana Bash, Z. Byron Wolf,
   Barbara Starr, Ted Barrett, John King, and Jim Sciutto contributed to
   this report.
