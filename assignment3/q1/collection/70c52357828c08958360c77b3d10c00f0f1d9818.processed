   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [52]Tagging tips - [53]Search For Tags - [54]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       about the Harry Potter cartoon.  We have to endure another round of
       "Hagrid's in danger", or "The dark forces are taking over
       Hogwart's", or "Malfoy just emerged from the chamber to kill us
       all, Harry."
       It's just perfect, in a way, as it mocks the insipid.  Yes, Harry
       Potter has reached dead horse status with me.

       are really just two stories in all entertainment media: "someone
       leaves on a quest", and "a stranger comes to town".  Which are, of
       course, the flip sides of the same story.

       The Kid doesn't want to leave because as bad as things are here, he
       looks down at the RR tracks and instead of romanticizing what could
       be elsewhere, he thinks, ahh it's probably worse than here!
       I love the anti-road concept!

   ...favorite of Bolling's regular trips.
   (My humor deficiency, clearly; nothing against Bolling.  Lucky Ducky
   and God-Man are the regular features I find I like the most, but the
   pieces I love the best are usually the political or economic one-offs
   that aren't a part.of any recurring series -- or does that somehow
   constitute a series?  Hmm...)
   But this one knocked it out of the.park for me; five out of six on the
