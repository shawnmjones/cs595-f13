[24]Boehner tries to distract GOP from defund Obamacare scheme with more
pointless repeal votes

   U.S. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) speaks during a news conference
   on Capitol Hill in Washington, November 28, 2012. Boehner voiced
   optimism that Republicans could broker a deal with the White House to
   avoid year-end austerity measures, saying on Wedn
   House Speaker John Boehner apparently thinks the GOP's "defund
   Obamacare or shutdown the government" is crazy--or at least that's what
   he [30]reportedly told his leadership team during a private meeting on
   Tuesday. When he's not behind closed doors, however, Boehner [31]tells
   a different story:

     In public, Boehner refused to directly comment on the strategy,
     which is being promoted by high-profile Senate Republicans like Ted
     Cruz (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah) and Marco Rubio (Fla.).

     Asked directly after the strategy meeting how he feels about holding
     up government funding to starve Obamacare, Boehner said, "we've made
     no decisions about how we're going to proceed with the" continuing
     resolution, which will needs to be passed by the end of September to
     avoid a government shut down. He said he didn't know whether the
     government funding bill could be used to defund implementation of
     the law.

   So instead of calling out an idiotic idea for what it is, Boehner is
   now proposing that Republicans take even more meaningless votes against
   Obamacare. But even though this strategy gives beltway reporters an
   opportunity to try to divine what John Boehner really thinks ...

     The subtext of the leadership strategy is that they think it's
     insane to shut down the government in an effort to defund the health
     care law.

   ... what it really shows is that he's so damn scared of his own party
   that he can't even bring himself to condemn one the most obviously dumb
   ideas to come from Washington Republicans in a long time. Instead, he's
   trying to distract them.

   It's a pathetic display of weakness, but it's also kind of hilarious,
   because even if Boehner gets his way, it's not taking another
   half-dozen votes to repeal Obamacare will do anything to help
   Republicans repair their damaged brand. Basically, he's asking them to
   do something really dumb in order to avoid doing something even dumber.
   No wonder he doesn't want to talk about it in public.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   The only reason he's "high profile" is because he's a freaking Crazy

   Barack Obama needs to decide whether it's not worth calling the R's
   bluff (or not if they're willing to go full Gingrich on the shutdown).
   The economy is a bit stronger and perhaps it's time to decide that this
   continual, death-by-a-thousand cuts, holding up the budget/debt
   ceiling, etc, etc by the house is not worse than getting it all out in
   the open.

   Do what Bill Clinton did and allow the shutdown to occur. The American
   people (as dense as the periodically are) know that this and all the
   rest of the sequester/debt ceiling/continuing resolution is fully the
   fault of the Republicans and primarily the hoard of Tea Bag blinded
   congress-critters.

   Personally, I think it's time to quit screwing around.

       to negotiate and compromise with the R's.  The results are awful

       To Hell with the Grand Bargain.  If the R's want to shut down the
       gov't, let them.  That should hurt them significantly.
       The prospect of a debt limit default scares me, but it doesn't seem
       that the mainstream R's are suicidal enough for that.

   Think of it this way, Boehner is trying to protect himself, and the
   country, from tea bag Koch and friends--and, yes, it's an impossible
   job unless he's willing to call them out.  Why he wants this job is
   unimaginable--and why no sane R doesn't step up proves that power
