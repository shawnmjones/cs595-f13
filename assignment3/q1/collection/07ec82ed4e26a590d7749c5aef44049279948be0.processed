   This is from the House GOP's Spanish-language twitter account,
   [30]@GOPespanol. Can you spot what's amiss?
   House GOP's Spanish-language feed, which is actually all in English.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [48]Tagging tips - [49]Search For Tags - [50]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   McMorris is an embarassment to my state.  She votes party line.  She is

   A VP I used to work with and is a staunch republican met with her on a

   their outreach retreat about how to talk to Minorities.

   mass-cut-pasted from [618]myself (with permission).

     This reads like the "corrections" that scroll up at the end of SNL's
     Fox and Friends skits.

     "All countries south of America are actually not "just different
     parts of Mexico"

     "Hispanics are not browner the closer they lived to the Equator."

     "Tacos are a traditional food, NOT the formal currency of El
     Salvadore"

     "Texas never waged, much less won, a global war against the Evil
     Incan Empire"

     "Refried Beans have nothing to do with recycling."

     "Senor Frogs is not the President of Honduras"

     "Adding the letter "o" to English nouns and verbs is not considered
     'speaking Spanish'"

     "Texas was also never attacked by any Aztec Overlord."

     "Yes, California used to be part of Mexico."

     "No, we can't give it back."

     "Mariachi is a type folk music with a long history.  Not "Fajita
     Muzak""

     "No formal currency of any country, South American or otherwise, has
     Speedy Gonzales on it"

     "Taco Bell restaurants were founded by an American named Glen Bell.
      They do not, nor have they ever, served as embassies for Mexicans"

     "Do You Know the Way to San Jose?" was an American hit song in the
     late 1960's, not a an immigration-policy white paper from the
     Heritage Foundation

     Cinco de Mayo IS May 5th.  It IS NOT when Latinos celebrate Jesus's
     Birthday.

     Brazilian Waxing was invented in New York City.  It has nothing to
     do with Brazil, much less as any part of a government mandate.

     The Catholic Church does not issue a special "Spanish Bible"with the
     Book of Jose.

     Puerto Rico is an island and is NOT part of Mexico.  Or Central
     America.  Or South America.  At all.

     Correction:  "Do You Know the Way to San Jose" is, as it turns out,
     both a hit song in the late 1960s AND an immigration-policy white
     paper from the Heritage Foundation.

     Yes, South American countries refer to Soccer as "Futbol".  No they
     do not use it to settle disputes or elect their leaders.

     For the record, Charo is Spanish.  Just saying....

     For the further record, "Spanish" means "from Spain" (as in Europe)
     and not "speaks Mexican"

     "Dirty Sanchez" was not the Nicaraguan equivalent of Clint Eastwood
     and frankly, something best left undiscussed entirely.

       and understandable.
       But considering the growth of other Spanish language media, for
       people to suggest it shouldn't be considered because Hispanic
       people know English is less reasonable.  The vast majority of
       Hispanics are fluent in English, but many may have a preference for

       For less than you think it would cost...
       Throwing a dart in the air to see where it lands...
       Here's how:
       1 Create a subdomain on The DK
       2 Install WordPress on the subdomain.
       3 Use a [734]Translation Plug-In to automatically translate the
       diaries selected for the multilingual section of the site. (There
       are many WordPress Plug-Ins available some are even free, as
       WordPress is the most widely used CMS Platform on the World)
       4 Apologize for for not being perfect and ask for help from the
       community in making it better... Build it and they will come! Our
       community has much to offer as do they...
       5 Wordpress has a Multi-User function where the multilingual site
       users can have their own blog or diary much like here...
       I'm not the guy for the job I've got some WordPress MU sites, but
       this scale is out of my league, and I speak Spanish as well as a
       Teabagger would...
       I'm just saying it bears a look if you haven't done it already,
       rather than a dismissal as too costly without looking...
