[22]Edward Snowden leaves Hong Kong

   [29]The Guardian:

     Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower, is believed to have arrived
     in Moscow after Hong Kong authorities allowed him to leave despite a
     US request for his arrest.

     In a statement, WikiLeaks said the 30-year-old was heading to a
     democratic country "via a safe route" for asylum purposes and that
     the organisation was assisting at his request. Snowden had been in
     hiding in Hong Kong since identifying himself as the source of
     revelations on US surveillance programmes.

     His flight from US authorities, which want to charge him with
     espionage, appeared set to continue with an onward flight west from
     Moscow to Havana on Monday. From there, various reports indicated
     that he would try to get to either Caracas or Quito.

     [...] Snowden is believed to have boarded Aeroflot SU213 on Sunday
     morning, bound for Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. Reuters cited an
     airline source who said the whistleblower would fly on to Cuba on
     Monday, before travelling on to Venezuela.

     Snowden had earlier cited Iceland as a possible refuge in an
     interview with the Guardian.

     In a statement, WikiLeaks said: "He is bound for a democratic nation
     via a safe route for the purposes of asylum, and is being escorted
     by diplomats and legal advisers from WikiLeaks.

     "Mr Snowden requested that WikiLeaks use its legal expertise and
     experience to secure his safety. Once Mr Snowden arrives at his
     final destination his request will be formally processed."

   There's a [30]recommended diary from flitedocnm discussing the news.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       what's left of his support? No less than Rand Paul, his only
       defender in Congress is warning him not to "cozy up to the
       Russians". Now, on to Cuba then Venezuella? Sounds like he's going
       out of his way to p!ss off what base he had.

       His "base" today are anti-American lefties and maybe a smattering

       he heads to Cuba. Hopefully he no longer has a significant number

   And considering the time I've been a member of this site, suggesting

   People are free to criticize China or USA or any country here as far as
   I know provided it's fact-oriented, and I try to stick to facts as much
   as possible and cite sources when making criticisms.

   Feel free to show me my errors, my mind is open and my self willing to

   What I don't have to accept unquestioning is some of the faulty

   Are we so frightened we cannot tolerate hearing the truth?

   Are we so sheep-like only the sugar-coated lies will serve?

       I find the extreme left wing radicalization of some on this site

       up in arms about this. Only Washington insiders and certain web
       bloggers. I am increasingly finding TalkingPointsMemo more to my
       liking. Kos hasn't weighed in much here, so I will give him the
       benefit of the doubt. Not pandering, but the reason I came to DKOS
       is that I liked Markos' style and amazingly there really wasn't
       anyone one in the political sphere who I agreed with more on an
       issue by issue basis. Obama is not a dictator. He has a FISA court
       which was approved by Congress. If Congress doesn't like what the
       court is doing they can propose a new bill. But this website
       doesn't have daily access to Obama's daily intelligence report, but

       Do you think the president even spends much time on this? I doubt
       it -- mostly it would be delegated to someone else to understand
       and worry about.
       How much do you trust the bureaucracy all the way down (which
       doesn't change when the administration does)?
       Are you comfortable with a (secret) "court" that appears to
       rubber-stamp virtually every request sent its way?
       This is not a question whose answer depends on "who is president
       right now" -- it's a question if these activities are appropriate
       and constitutional under any administration.
       I have mixed feelings about the program. On the one hand, I can do
       nothing but condemn that the program's existence was kept secret.
       On the other hand, I have much less problem with individual court
       orders identifying specific people to monitor being kept secret
       until exposing that information would no longer compromise an
       investigation.
       Also, voluntarily exposing your information on Facebook is
       completely different than the government using their power to
       intercept and track information you thought was protected from
       their snooping. As well, Facebook also has no right to criminally
       prosecute you because they happen to (think) you are guilty of
       something -- that's a very big distinction. I let friends into my
       house all the time, that doesn't mean that I think it's okay for
       government agents to come in whenever they want.

       well as Teafvckers are bought and paid for -- and that policy needs

       how effing put upon they are, the poor little princesses.
       Another thing that needs to happen is that the SCOTUS needs
       cleansing of bought and paid for judiciary,and there are FIVE OF
       THOSE.  Either clean it or pack it with a spitpile of additional
       judges.
       Another thing that has to happen is that Monsanto needs to be
       disrupted and its stock of GMO seed stuff needs to be incinerated,
       all millions of pounds of it.

       and others like me as traitors, as liars, as facists, as phonies,
       as the shame of this website for not being
       go-along-to-get-alongists.
       I've been a member of NOW since NOW was created. I'm way far left.
        That's left me working as a volunteer for people who often don't
       get elected or get past primaries, and then working for the
       election of people I think are too close to the center.
       Pay attention to policies, not "character" of a democrat once s/he
       is elected.  Look at what the person can do and what the office is
       expected to do and what "advisers" surround them.
       Obama hasn't said much I dislike AS President. I DETEST some of the
       policies of the White House at present, but those are dictated by
       needs, not the character of the person who is the spokesmouth for
       the admiistration.
       I don't dislike the President. I never expected much of him
       personally... he's a CENTRIST.... I DETEST Eric Holder and think
       he's owned by Corporations.  I REALLY detest Rahm Emmanuel.  I
       don't like some of O's other advisors, either, dammit.
       I am FURIOUS that Gitmo isn't closed.  I am FURIOUS that the camps
       and deals made by the Bush Administration for 8 years to torture
       people out of the US have not been voided.  I am FURIOUS that a
       young man on trial for treason was TORTURED IN THIS COUNTRY BY OUR
       ARMED FORCES AND OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE prior to his trial...
       that was part of his testimony.. and have you noticed how QUIET it
       is in the press now that his claim of torture came out in his
       testimony?  The hopes are we'll just forget about the trial.  This
       harrassment of Snowdon is also bullspit, dammit.  It's even sicker
       than the continual harrassment of Assange.
       I don't blame that on the President. I BLAME THAT ON THE DEMOCRATIC
       PARTY which has had FIVE YEARS of its being in control of the
       Administration to end torture, to shut down Gitmo, to void deals
       with other nations to torture people on behalf of our intelligence
       service in facilities not directly owned by or overtly funded by
       our government, but funded in part nonetheless by this nation.
       I am FURIOUS at the continuing war on women and fed up with less
       than OVERT and FEROCIOUS condemnation of it, daily and if necessary
       hourly, by the Administration.
       That doesn't mean I hate Obama.  I don't.  I don't want him

   It's doubtful any one would, even for a polical contribution to the

       Daily KOS is not a liberal site, and does not actually promote

       conservative Democrats that block every liberal move from the
       party. We don't care if someone acts like a Republican at every

     Except that we are not spying on everyone,

   Except that the US is in fact conducting a massive amount of spying,
   with very little oversight or restrictions. The NSA doesn't need
   massive new data centers because it's a small operation.

     and only assassinate people with drones who want to kill us.

   In fact there is very little information on who the US targets, and
   why.

   If you look at the number of people who were innocent but where jailed
   in Guantanamo (and some still are), it's more or less a certainty that
   the US government, considering the massive amounts of people it has
   murdered, has at some point targeted the wrong people.

       Come on Horace, you and I can agree that America has gone way too
       far to the right and is approaching an Oligarchy, but it isn't
       anything near a Fascist Italy or the military junta of Argentina

       The modern definitions on the internet are interesting because they
       all seem to downplay or not mention corporatism at all.
       Yet I have an older analog dictionary that I've kept for this very
       reason. It's an American Heritage paperback dictionary I used in
       college and bought for its face price of 79 cents. Its definition
       of fascism:

     A system of government that exercises a dictatorship of the extreme
     right, typically through the merging of state and business
     leadership, together with a belligerent nationalism.
       I can't tell you what the copyright date on the book is because the
       covers fell off long ago and I have it taped together. But the
       above IS THE DEFINITION of fascism in 1979, when I was using this
       "spellchecker" in college. And it pretty much sums up how I was
       taught to think of it since my grade school civic classes in the
       1960s.
       So call THAT definition whatever you want....THAT is what we are
       fighting. Everything else is semantics and a circular firing squad.

       Please do not deliberately misrepresent what I said.
       I fight just as hard as you, and maybe even harder, to reverse the
       corporate influence on American policy.  But to imply America is a
       fascist country doesn't help that cause.  In fact, most uninformed
       Americans are going to immediately dismiss the legitimate concern
       that corporations have far too much influence, when they hear
       someone say America is close to Fascism.

       (for the most part) when we found out what the US government DID to

       To be sure my point is clear,: it requires blinders to pretend that
       Obama and the USG are somehow governed by the rule of law.  They
       are not and this is plain.  They and their defenders appeal to the
       rule of law and human decency when it is convenient, such as when
       Snowden exposes their anti-democratic behavior or when some country
       whose resources they are interested in engages in human rights
       abuses.  But in practice, they have not honored domestic or
       international law for over a decade now.
       Amazing that people can express puffed up righteousness over
       Snowden's lawbreaking while not batting an eyelash at Obama's
       summary executions and thumbing his nose at prosecution of torture
       and other war crimes, not to mention a long-term program of
       institutionalized violation of the constitution.
       But I am serious that, little as I know about him, I trust Snowden
       to act in my interest and the interest of the consitution (which to
       me is "America") more than I trust Obama.

   the prosecution of whistleblowers and the intimidation of journalists.

   But go ahead and try to smear people, anything to desperately save face

       smeared, and yet you say that the rest of us have a "dear leader".
       That term is a smear of everyone in the country who likes this
       president, and it is a smear of the president himself. So if I were
       you, I'd stop feigning hurtfulness at being smeared. You folks are
       the ones that ratcheted up the ugly language in the first place,
       and of all things it was aimed at people who support a
       twice-elected African-American Democratic president.

       Why is that even relevant in this discussion? Christ.

     Snowden is not a whistleblower (didn't reveal anything illegal),
     he's a leaker.
       Whether he revealed illegal things or not is debatable, and not a
       requisite for being a whistleblower.

     The President has been trying both terms to end indefinite detention
     -- what have you done to promote ending it?
       No, he's not. Obama supports indefinite detention. He tried to
       close Guantanamo Bay because of the bad pr it gives the US, but he
       fully supports the principle of indefinite detention.

     What's not American now is any person with a security clearance

       information to the Guardian and the Washington Post.  Snowden and
       Greenwald have said that Snowden has asked those news organizations

       There is no evidence, or any story, even, of Snowden giving any

   It's OK for government to break the law as long as it's MY party giving
   the orders!  And those violations of basic constitutional liberties are
   dreamy when a Dem does it.

   Snowden.  doesn't.  Matter.  Shoot the messenger is the only message
   the R0xx0rs have left.  But it's not Snowden, it's what he revealed
   that matters.

   Now if I understand r0xx0r talking points right, comes the totally CT
   rant about how we should assume and expect that we can have no
   communication with anyone whatsoever without the intel community
   listening in.  Look, when I worked for the NSA in the 70s we had the
   capability to do that then, but we didn't.  It's not any sort of
   established principle that just because you can do it means you should
   do it.  It's a policy decision, one which Snowden had nothing to do
   with.  But as an advocate of letting torturers walk, and using tax
   dollars to pay bonuses to banksters, any 100%er for this administration
   surely agrees with Leona Helmsley that laws, like taxes, are strictly
   for the little people.

   rather unsettling about this Horace, we have surely fallen  from
   Liberal grace when a US citizen has to escape to a 'democratic nation'
   :

     In a statement, WikiLeaks said: "He is bound for a democratic nation
     via a safe route for the purposes of asylum, and is being escorted
     by diplomats and legal advisers from WikiLeaks.

   I know we are hellbent on chasing whistleblowers and prosecuting them,
   but why didn't the government avoid all this and just allow him to come
   back without threat of prosecution....why couldn't we have that
   national dialog on civil liberties and intrusive state security?

   I suppose it's because they have something they have to hide, and I
   wonder what any of us would do to escape the fate of a Bradley Manning
   or a Julian Assange...realizing that things are much different today
   than it was for Ellsberg.

       without leaving an audit trail of every file and system that you

       of security, all the audit files would have been gathered up and
       who did what to whom would have been known at that point. Snowden,
       even as an network administrator, couldn't have covered his every

 Besides, the House is an ELECTED body ([2154]0+ / 0-)

   and the theory is that they're "our representatives". If they do
   something terminally stupid, they can be voted out at the next election
   - or t least there's a (usually remote) chance of it.

   The Supreme Court is APPOINTED by the President - they are not our
   representatives, and if they go batshit there is fuck-all that can be
   done about them.

   IMHO the system broke down in 1876-77, when the House shirked its
   explicit Constitutional responsibility and cut the Supreme Court a
   share of the deal. From then on it was only a matter of time before the
   Supremes would feel qualified to decide the whole thing.

   We were damn lucky that we went almost 125 years without that sort of
   situation cropping up again.

   Elected "representatives" are only representative of the people when
   there are free elections. Our political system is rigged so that only
   the two major parties have a chance at wining any significant
   percentage of the House. That makes it very easy for Wall Street to run
   the system, and why we frequently have to hold our nose, and vote for
   the least malodorous candidate on the ballot.

   UN investigation declared Manning's treatment to be "cruel and

       to be honest.  On the one hand, I think the information Snowden
       leaked is something the American public has a right to know.
       But on the other hand.........there's something about him I don't
       really trust.  Things like this, releasing his itinerary, and the
       fact that he even came out in the first place.  I don't know,
       something just makes me feel like he thinks he's in a spy movie.  I

       The information he revealed is certainly disturbing.  And I'm not

       But at the same time, the speculation some have put out there that
       China and Russia probably wouldn't be willing to let him leave, or
       even stay there, without getting something in return, seems to me
       that it may be valid.  In which case I think his motives ARE

   When I said he was a traitor a few days ago, I was HR'ed. Those HR's

       But I don't see the comparison as valid as promoted by anti-Snowden
       posters because neither of BO's targets have been imprisoned for a
       similar length of time, nor has any prsion sentence been handed
       down.  We have yet to see what will happen, and bringing up Mandela
       now simply doesn't make sense.
       At this point in time, none of the whistleblowers can be compared
       to Mandela, yet the anti-whistleblower crowd keeps bringing up
       Mandela.
       In 28 years, yeah, maybe we can compare Mandela's experiences to
       BO's targets, or if BO's targets are given light sentences, then we
       can compare the suffering of them.

   The ignorance of history, especially the history of protest movements,
   around here is astounding!

   Ever since Thoreau, the theory of civil disobedience has been that if
   you break a law that you think is unjust, you go to trail, explain
   yourself and accept the unjust punishment.

   In Mandela's second trial, he decided not to dispute the facts alleged,
   confessed to the crimes he was accused of (sabotage) and went to
   prison.

   Not only did he go to prison, but after about 15 years he was offered
   his freedom if he would renounce his prior tactics.

   He refused and stayed in prison -- pretty much voluntarily -- nearly
   another 15 years.

   So it wasn't "good" that he went to prison, but it was principled.
   That's what civil disobedience is.

   It is disappointing that Snowden not only isn't facing the consequences
   of his civil disobedience but he is flying around to countries with
   which the US has competitive intelligence relations.

       It's admirable the lengths some people go through to protest
       something, but it doesn't mean it's mandatory.
       Choosing not to subject yourself to torture, execution or life

   Remember how long it took to GET him that "fair" trial? Remember what
   he went through, and for how long, beforehand?

   Also, fallacy alert: whistleblowing IS NOT "civil disobedience". It can
   include civil disobedience IF the whistleblower has any confidence that
   they will be treated fairly and humanely by a responsible government.

   But that's a humongous IF, and nowadays most people don't care to take
   a chance on the "benevolence" of the US government.

       Snowden, the South China Morning Post reported that the
       whistleblower had handed over a series of documents to the paper
       detailing how the US had targeted Chinese phone companies as part

       The need for Patriot Act review has been there to have any time
       Congress wanted to belly up to the responsibility. And there are
       ways to draw attention to "egregious behavior" without going public
       with it and running.
       Snowden's disclosures are not pie fights at all, not at all
       irrelevant. IF he was serious about change, and willing to honor
       his commitments to the NSA and Booz Allen, there are members of
       Congress he could have gone to - who have made no secret of their
       views in the past - to introduce his concerns without violating all
       that stuff he signed  to get access - and seek ways to have them
       addressed.
       Would that have been effective? It sure would have been worth a try
       - or several tries - before doing what Snowden did.
       He is no hero for what or how he did it.

       For me, the issue at the bottom of whatever rationale there is for
       the Patriot Act and all those intelligence-gathering agencies -
       foreign-oriented, domestic or both - is whether we need a model for
       forestalling home-grown or foreign terrorist-type attacks.
       [Acknowledging that "terrorist" and "attacks" are loaded words, but
       not knowing what's more neutral that doesn't also bog down the
       thread of my point].
       The traditional model of law enforcement is to identify clues,
       track the perp down and call him, her or them to account. Almost
       always, this has meant penalizing a committed crime. Yes,
       "attempts" and "conspiracies" are crimes that can fall short of
       worse outcomes, but penalizing either of them in advance of a
       committed crime (rather than as part of it) seems only occasional.

     So, is law enforcement and the elaborate process that is due - that
     has been built up to free an accused, even if guilty, when the
     constable has blundered - up to task of forestalling criminal
     activity by a perp who is enabled and empowered by modern technology
     and our very open society?
       I believe that is a debate worth having at the outset.
       If your answer to that question is "Yes" or "Yes ... but we must
       stick to the traditional means of investigating and proceeding
       against such a perp", then the discussion probably should end
       there.
       My answer is No, the traditional model is not sufficient. It will
       be a struggle to find a ground that preserves basic Bill of Rights
       values. I am not confident that today's rules that the courts have
       so tightly equated to constitutional guarantees are up to the task.
       Maybe there should be special rules to address potential mass
       violence or foreign terrorist threats. "War" is not the right
       analogy but traditional law enforcement may not be either.

       Yes, to light ... and I am cynical about what will actually change,
       but it's time the Act was fully vetted. Way past time.
       Being critical of Edward Snowden does not mean I can't be critical
       of the Patriot Act and how it's been applied.
       As for him, if he thinks any of the countries who'll take him fit
       his democratic beliefs better than the US, I wish him bon voyage.
       If he stays in Russia or returns to China, and he thinks they won't
       value him for what he knows and can tell them about US intelligence
       and security matters, I wish him whatever result he gets.
       In those respects, yes, he is a traitor.

   I don't know, ask him before presuming to know his thoughts about the
   matter? Why is it even relevant? Snowden is on the run for the US
   government who wants to imprison (or even worse torture or kill him).
   What other choices does he have?

   Are your pissed off because someone revealed the massive spying under

   If Snowden felt strongly that he is doing the right thing here then he
   should have stayed in the United States and faced the music.

   I do recall MLK Jr or Ghandi fleeing their countries when the felt
   there was an injustice and fault the laws.  They stayed and even went
   to prison fighting for their causes.

   Nelson Mandela even went to prison for 28 years fighting for the cause
   he believed in.

   Instead we have Snowden running first to China giving our secrets to
   them and then flying to Russia, Cuba and then Venezuela.

   Some hero.  He is a joke and a gutless traitor to the United States.

   I hope that the CIA picks him up in Venezuela and brings him back to
   face the music here in the United States.

       Government officials are pushing that propaganda because they know
       that while Snowden remains free, it puts pressure them to come
       clean about the surveillance abuses that have been confirmed by
       multiple former NSA employees and experts.  It also allows Snowden
       to point out the dishonesty in their defenses. Government officials
       want to manipulate public opinion to try to force Snowden back or,
       alternatively, to distract the public from his disclosures.
       As a former government employee, who observed the dishonesty of
       official public communications (and spent some time in a government

   -- Publicly Praised Wall Street
   -- Pushed through Free Trade Job Off-shoring w/ Columbia, Panama, and
   S. Korea
   -- Pushing through in Secret the Trans Pacific Partnership
   -- Affirmed the Executive Branch right to issue secret kill orders
   -- Selected three different Banksters as Chief of Staff
   -- Put a Wall Street Bankster in as Treasury Secretary
   -- Bernanke, Summers, Geithner, Holder
   -- Obama's Department of Justice publicly proclaimed its inability to
   do anything to Wall Street
   ----------------------

   Just a few tid bits.  Claiming that a site, dedicated to electing

       story as being anti-government, anti-NSA, but also the people have
       been naively taught to be fearful of the mysterious and unnamed
       enemy i.e. the boogeyman. So once the initial anger at being spied
       on by an intrusive government died down, I believe their same
       commonplace post 9/11 irrational fear kicked back in.
       And now they go on with their lives, likely over the story, likely
       no longer caring what happens to him, likely no longer caring that
       the NSA engages in intrusive behavior. It is what it unfortunately
       is. Only day to day political activists and people with political
       interest such as those at this site will continue to care and shine
       a light upon it.

 Not true, IMO ([3638]0+ / 0-)
       While large numbers of people will behave as you suggest, that's a
       given.  It's always the case.  What matters are what it does to
       people whose opinions count, individually and collectively, whether
       they be in government, law, academia, journalism, or just active
       voters who talk to their friends.
       I have never seen anything like it.  The director of national
       intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., was forced to admit that his
       previous statement to Congress that the agency did not collect
       records on millions of Americans was untrue.  The president assured
       Americans one day that no one was reading their e-mails of
       listening to their phone calls when a few days latrer a document
       was released demonstrating that his assurances were not true.
       And with Snowden at large, they are greatly constrained in what
       they can say, for fear of being proven wrong or untruthful again.
       Smearing him and calling him a traitor is their best weapon right
       now.

     [3821]HKSAR Government issues statement on Edward Snowden

       The HKSAR Government today (June 23) issued the following
     statement on Mr Edward Snowden:

          Mr Edward Snowden left Hong Kong today (June 23) on his own
     accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel.

          The US Government earlier on made a request to the HKSAR
     Government for the issue of a provisional warrant of arrest against
     Mr Snowden. Since the documents provided by the US Government did
     not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law,
     the HKSAR Government has requested the US Government to provide
     additional information so that the Department of Justice could
     consider whether the US Government's request can meet the relevant
     legal conditions. As the HKSAR Government has yet to have sufficient
     information to process the request for provisional warrant of
     arrest, there is no legal basis to restrict Mr Snowden from leaving
     Hong Kong.

          The HKSAR Government has already informed the US Government of
     Mr Snowden's departure.

          Meanwhile, the HKSAR Government has formally written to the US
     Government requesting clarification on earlier reports about the
     hacking of computer systems in Hong Kong by US government agencies.
     The HKSAR Government will continue to follow up on the matter so as
     to protect the legal rights of the people of Hong Kong.

       What the HK just said was "You people pissed us off and we aren't

       Whether you think they are right or wrong or not, they were holding
       all of the cards and the US Government pissed them off so they said
       piss off.  If the US really wants this guy, they are going to have
       to work a bit harder on their diplomatic skills - and also deal
       with the big mess that they have created by hacking into computer
       systems all around the world.

          [3902]psychodrew, [3903]DRo, [3904]Demeter Rising

     [3905]Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying's Remarks

     Q: Edward Snowden, former contractor for the US National Security
     Agency, has reportedly left Hong Kong on today's flight to Moscow.
     The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
     (HKSAR) has released a statement on that. What is China's comment?

     A: We have noted relevant reports but are not aware of the
     specifics. We will continue to follow its development. Hong Kong is
     ruled by law. On the basis of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
     Administrative Region and the principle of "one country, two
     systems", the central government always respects the HKSAR
     government's handling of affairs in accordance with law.

     Q: As disclosed by the media, the US has hacked Chinese
     telecommunications companies and the Tsinghua University. How does
     China respond?

     A: We are gravely concerned about the recently disclosed cyber
     attacks by relevant US government agencies against China. It shows
     once again that China falls victim to cyber attacks. We have made
     representations with the US.

     I would like to reiterate that China is opposed to all forms of
     cyber attacks. We are ready to actively enhance dialogue and
     cooperation with the international community in the spirit of mutual
     respect, so as to jointly uphold peace and security of the cyber
     space.

       successful capitalist society but their rulers imprison dissidents,

     My purpose here is to share information I think would help to
     re-frame the debate with facts about what the NSA (and their ilk in
     the US and elsewhere) now do to collect, analyze and act on
     information, and to pose some basic questions for consideration.

     If you think it's possible that:
     - countries, including the USA, spy on other countries and their own
     citizens
     - the internet and other digital communications facilitate data
     collection & analysis
     - people have become conditioned to accept increasing surveillance
     and less privacy
     - that cyber warfare has become a core mission of the (global) MIC
     - that governments use fear to manipulate public opinion and gain
     acceptance of intrusion
     ... see you after the fold.
       Countries spy on each other and their own citizens, but if you
       haven't grasped the nature, scope and impact US and UK internet
       spying is having, you are asleep.
       Forget what China is saying for a moment (if you can let it go now
       that Snowden has moved on) and listed to what other countries
       including close allies of the US are saying.
       You may accept it unquestioning but the rest of the world is not.

   China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela.  Not a single paragon of civil
   liberties and government non-surveillance in the bunch.

   Please abandon any illusions you had about this guy.  He's a
   narcissist, and now a dupe (willing or otherwise) of every
   totalitarian, journalist-imprisoning creep who doesn't like the US.

   I was sympathetic to him when he was just pointing out the NSA domestic
   surveillance.  But the moment he started blabbing about spy ops in
   China (which was now obviously his way of bribing HK to look the other
   way as he saved his own skin) he lost all credibility with me.  And now
   he's tripled down...looked to Putin & Castro to make safe his escape to
   a country that hands out prison sentences for poking fun at El
   Presidente.

   The one bit of good news however....pretty much sinks any chance of
   Rand Paul getting elected again.

          [4742]dream weaver, [4743]Willa Rogers, [4744]aliasalias

   I think people's reactions to this come down to differing philosophies
   about who to blame for the harm that occurs when the government is
   doing something illegal, which is later revealed. Do you blame the
   government for doing something illegal, or do you blame the person who
   revealed it?

   According to international law (and the US, after WW II), if you know
   of government lawbreaking, you're legally and ethically required to do
   everything in your power to stop the lawbreaking, or you become
   personally responsible for allowing it to continue.

   In this case, the US appears likely to have broken the laws of pretty
   much every major country, including all of our most powerful allies.
   And it's far from impossible that the program is eventually ruled to
   have broken the US Constitution as well. So whoever authorized and
   executed this program took a huge risk with US credibility, not to
   mention legal problems, betting that this program would never be
   revealed. So when the illegal program was revealed, immense harm was
   done to the US credibility and legal standing.

   So some people blame Snowden for revealing the illegal program, and
   talk about him being a traitor, etc.

   Personally, I blame whoever authorized and executed the illegal
   program. Given the massive scale at which it operated, and that it
   obviously violated the laws of so many countries, it was inevitable
   that it would be discovered and that all of our allies would react
   extremely negatively. So, aside from the legal and ethical issues, they
   showed extremely bad judgement by making the harm likely.

 snowden selling secrets for money? ([4923]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [4924]Tam in CA, [4925]mikolo

   i think that any argument along those lines really falls flat.  he is
   in a whole heap o' trouble, that one would pay millions not to be in.

   somebody said, when even us liberals have turned against him .  ...that
   also falls flat.  for the most part we don't know each other, and all
   of our opinion sets are complex and sometimes seeming contradictory or
   paradoxical.  some would say that to take the approach of condemning
   snowden because of what country he goes to seek asylum is a sure sign
   of anti-liberalism.  i'd say it's at least anti-thoughtfulness.   to
   try to build teams on DailyKos, to place others outside the Pale, does
   not contribute to our assessment of all this.  when someone uses such
   an argument, it seems unconvincing to me, like when someone writes a
   comment like, 'i am a true liberal democrat but obama has really lost
   me because [insert republican talking point].'

   to say simply that Venezuela, for example, is a straightforward example
   of lack of freedom, and that the USA is clearly the world leader in
   freedom - that simplistic position is the basis for a lot of vicious
   rightwing ideology, and more importantly it is doubtful.  things are
   mixed. we have a banking system that has impoverished the country as a
   whole, giving billions to the already wealthy, and establishing
   impunity for the banking criminals. people on DailyKos pretty much
   unite behind Elizabeth Warren on these issues, and that is why many of
   us contributed in our small or big way to getting her elected.
   venezuela's government would not let their bankers oppress them in that
   same way (or maybe i am wrong in which case tell me about it) and that
   makes them a lot freer country in important ways.  venezuela, usa,
   cuba, whatever country you are in, the powerhungry and greedy have the
   most control because of the lamentable state of human social evolution.

   the united states is the champ when it comes to imprisoning people.
   Russia is second.  We know that great numbers of people imprisoned in
   our country are there for possession of small amount of drugs, often
   marijuana, and that the incarceration happens extremely
   disproportionately, white/black.

   i do not think the arguments that try to demonize snowden for fleeing
   where he can flee make much sense.  i think humans the world over are
   striving to evolve socially, to organize our interconnectedness better,
   and I'm all for voting for Obama over whatever jerk the Republicans put
   up, but if you are realistic about the state of humanity, you won't
   waste energy on defending and national government as pure or even
   obviously good, because they all are mixed bags at best - at very best.

   looks like this is one of those subjects where it ain't easy being

   Revealing information about domestic surveillance is one thing,
   revealing information about international intelligence gathering is
   another. Ellsberg revealed no current information when he released the
   Pentagon Papers. My guess is Snowdon didn't think it through but at
   this point has to make friends where he is because the US is going to
   put him in jail.

   Making no moral judgement here. I don't think what Snowdon revealed
   about domestic surveillance is that worrisome and was in line with what
   anyone paying attention would be expecting. Prism was probably useful
   but all but the most idiot jihadi's would know those systems were in
   place. Now some of the idiot jihadis will change their methods. China,
   who spies on the US pretty constantly, now has a little media
   smokescreen and maybe some operational details they didn't have.
   Snowdon has now written his bio. Where ever else the rest of his life
   goes, this is it.

   Yes, its come to that.  Snowden had to flee the United States - that
   den of tyranny - so he could breathe the air of freedom in (so far) the
   People's Republic of China, Russia, and (soon perhaps) Cuba and
   Venezuela.

   Although he will remain forever a superstar to some here on DKOS, his
   fifteen minutes of fame are measurably shortened by this.

   No, of course the US is not pure nor always beneficent.  We have too
   many horrors to atone for in our history.  But we remain the best
   example of an ongoing experiment to create a sustainable democracy.
   For every Bull Connor in our history, we have an MLK.

   As far as the foreign intelligence collection - honestly, what do
   people think the NSA and CIA do?  What every other intelligence service
   in the world does?  What intelligence services have done since the dawn
   of time?

   If you want the USA to stop collecting intelligence abroad, then
   mobilize and write Congress to democratically abolish the US
   intelligence establishment.  Don't hide behind shadowy groups of
   unknown foreigners like Wikileaks - have the courage to bring your
   proposals before the American people.  Then accept the democratic
   outcome.

   I don't even recognize this site as "progressive."  I feel like I am

   So if this episode "splits the left" and leads to mass defection from
   Obama, and this site, the Dems are in huge trouble on a national level.
   Nobly a few percentage points separated Romney from Obama.  If a few

   of all the corporatist hypocrites in Washington, including President
   Obama, in the dirt. And I say GOOD for him.

   To all you people who say that Snowden is a gutless traitor, I think
   you need to look at what is happening to Bradley Manning. I think you
   need to think about what it's like to spend your entire life in jail in
   solitary confinement. And make no mistake, these prosecutions are
   political in nature. The global terrorists and jihadists know that they
   are being subjected to covert action, that they are being listened to
   by fascist corporatists, and they take appropriate precautions. It is
   only we the people in the US who are being treated like mushrooms (kept
   in the dark and fed shit) and are unable to take precautions to protect
   our privacy.

   Think about how many European leaders and others during World War 2
   fled to England and the US to avoid being killed and to be able to
   carry on the fight against the fascists.

   This is what wikileaks and Snowden will be doing. Continuing the fight
   against the fascist hypocrit corporatists.

   The fact that he didn't prevent him from revealing his identity before

   Diary after front page diary on DKOS uses the word "whistleblower"
   alongside Snowden with no apparent understanding of what it means.  It
   is a classic propaganda tool to repeat something over and over until it
   becomes "fact."

   A whistleblower reveals an illegality.  From what we know - based on
   Snowden's own words - the NSA appears to have been operating within its
   discretion and under law.

   The true debate is:

   - Do the laws sufficiently protect the constitutional rights of
   Americans?
   - Do we conduct foreign intelligence collection in conformity with our
   international commitments?

   That debate started long, long before Snowden came onto the scene and
   it will continue as long as the USA exists.  It is the eternal debate
   of how to protect a democratic polity using means that inherently
   require some delegation of authority.

   We do know that Snowden - again by his own words - is a criminal.  He
   violated the laws of this country.

   If Snowden were a proud citizen of the country he was born in, he would
   be here at home standing up for what he believes in and contesting it
   through the system.  Instead he is embarked on a world tour of
   "democratic nations" who coincidentally happen to be US rivals or
   critics.

   He belongs in a jail cell, not on a pedestal.

   Wonder how they'd treat him if he were Ecuadorian national Eduardo
   Snowden....I particularly like the part about "threatens the rights of
   citizens to be informed about sensitive issues."  Sounds familiar. Will
   Mr. Snowden speak out against that while he's there, or is his silence
   part of his asylum deal?

   New York, June 14, 2013--The new Communications Law approved today by
   the Ecuadoran National Assembly represents a severe blow to freedom of
   expression, said the Committee to Protect Journalists. The law
   establishes regulation of editorial content and gives authorities the
   power to impose arbitrary sanctions and censor the press.

   The law not only undermines journalists' ability to report critically
   but threatens the right of citizens to be informed about sensitive
   issues. This legislation puts into law a key goal of the Correa
   presidency: muzzling all critics of his administration."

   I love it Snowden complains about losing civil liberties in the U.S.
   Before he left he had not lost any of his civil liberties then he goes
   to China and maybe Russia where civil liberties do no even exist.

   He is delusional or getting very bad advice for Greenwald and Assange.

   I have read all these comments on here and can not believe I am on

   to read on right wing blogs.

   The hero Nelson Mandela was called a traitor by the South African
   government and a terrorist by the UK and other governments. To his
   people and millions of others he was and is one of the greatest heroes
   and freedom fighters of all time. It is all in a name and I stand on
   the side of the latter, hero and freedom fighter.

   Edward Snowden is a modern day hero and freedom fighter. He revealed
   the information to the Guardian a British newspaper and then it flashed
   around the world. He revealed activities which are unconstitutional.
   This is being a hero. If he returns to the US he will most probably be
   interrogated and imprisoned at the least.

   Now he has to go into exile from his own country and family and
   friends. This guy does not need this he deserves a medal and a big
   thank you from all of us.

 Glenn Greenwald ([5189]0+ / 0-)

   I'm surprised there is so little interest in Greenwald, who was hired
   by The Guardian just a few months before this story broke. I don't know
   that we fully understand his role in Snowden's adventures. Did
   Greenwald approach The Guardian or was he recruited? I wonder. And this
   morning on Meet the Press, the very last question David Gregory asked
   Greenwald was, "You are a journalist but you are also a lawyer. Do you
   think you could be prosecuted for your role in releasing sensitive
   information?". This question made Greenwald furious and he responded
   with some snotty comment aimed at Gregory about "people who call
   themselves journalists". Then in the next segment ten minutes later,
   Gregory said that after Greenwald went off-camera, he had tweeted "We
   don't need to worry about the government criminalizing journalists when
   we have David Gregory to do it".
