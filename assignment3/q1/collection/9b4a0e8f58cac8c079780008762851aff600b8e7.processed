   Pliers cutting cord/cable.
   At first blush, this bit of legislation coming out of Sen. John
   McCain's office is [30]full of awesome:

     Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is working on legislation that would
     pressure cable and satellite TV providers to allow their customers
     to pick and choose the channels they pay for, his office confirmed
     on Wednesday [...]

     In addition to pressuring cable providers to offer channels a la
     carte, McCain's new bill would bar TV networks from bundling their
     broadcast stations with cable channels they own during negotiations
     with the cable companies, according to industry sources. So for
     example, the Disney Company, which owns both ABC and ESPN, could not
     force a cable provider to pay for ESPN in order to carry ABC.

     The industry officials said the bill would also end the sports
     blackout rule, which prohibits cable companies from carrying a
     sports event if the game is blacked out on local broadcast
     television stations.

   A la carte: As anyone trying to sign up for cable or satellite knows,
   you get stuck paying a bill for dozens (if not hundreds) of channels,
   when the vast majority of us really only watch a handful. In my perfect
   world, I'd pay for the four broadcast networks, Syfy, Comedy Central,
   ESPN, Bein Sports, NBC sports and BBC America. Heck, if it wasn't for
   sports, I'd ditch the broadcast networks and catch the best shows on
   Netflix, Amazon and/or iTunes.

   Instead, I have to subscribe to a billion godawful and irrelevant (to
   me) networks. And what's worse, I have to subscribe at a higher tier to
   get the handful of channels I do like. It's gotten to the point that if
   sports leagues offered their product direct to consumers (via online),
   I'd ditch satellite in a heartbeat. Let me pick a la carte, and I have
   less impetus to do so.

   Bundling: This is the practice of studios forcing cable and satellite
   operators to carry their shitty networks or they pull the stuff people
   actually want to see. So, for example, Disney may force a cable company
   to carry ABC Family, and if they don't, they threaten to pull ESPN.
   It's a shitty way to do business. Any legislation banning this practice
   would be fantastic.

   Sports blackouts: Being a Chicago fan living in the SF Bay Area, I
   don't have to deal with this scourge of sports broadcast rules. Get rid
   of it.

   The legislation would also bar broadcast networks from pulling their
   over-the-air broadcasts and moving them over to cable [31]in response
   to Aereo--a company that provides over-the-air TV via the internet by
   employing thousands of tiny antennas. Cable and satellite operators pay
   big bucks to carry the broadcast networks, and this small but clever
   company is upending that business model.

   The broadcast lobby is gearing up, of course, and they'll claim this
   legislation will "stifle innovation" and other such bullshit. But with
   over 1 million Americans "[32]cutting the cord" last year, and the
   trend accelerating, this legislation could very well rescue these
   broadcasters from their own myopic stupidity.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   When you can stream Netflix on nearly every entertainment device going,
   ala carte channel subscription via internet connectivity becomes
   extremely attractive, and that will make the cable companies internet
   content delivery companies and locally, internet providers.

 There's only so much bandwidth ([332]10+ / 0-)

       Just like Interstate 5 may be adequate most of the time, if even
       twice as many people as normal decide to drive from Los Angeles to
       San Francisco, it will clog. Never mind if EVERYONE decides to do
       it.
       I live in a rural area. In my small valley, we have three options -
       a cell provider, a local wireless provider, and satellite. I have
       the wireless, and I have the advantage of a pretty substantial
       connection. This is in part because I am the only major daytime
       user in my half of the valley. In the other half of the valley,
       there are several high needs users, and more density, and they have
       to keep users more tightly throttled so that no one person can
       overwhelm the network.
       So, if say the USDA is evaluating bandwidth, they see my
       connection, and they say, "See, this valley has broadband." What
       they don't see is that this valley has enough broadband for about 4
       connections like that in a community of maybe 800 households.
       The cell provider, again, says, "Hey, we got it covered, see, a

       The difference between cable TV and internet on demand is that
       cable TV is basically only working with 50 or 100 files (or even
       1000 on the most modern systems) that any users can request on the
       network, lending itself to sharing, caching, etc. If every user can
       request any video ever created at any time, those advantages go
       away; you need far far more data capacity.

       awkward failure to edit. This is what I meant to say:
       The cell provider, again, says, "Hey, we got it covered, see, a
       user on our network has plenty of access." And they use that, when
       USDA asks, to say that there's really no need for any subsidized
       access or competitors here, we're totally good, situation normal!
        But again, once you go from 30 occasional users to 800 full time

       by the cell provider is essentially a lie, a lie meant to buy them

   for internet and cable. We pay through the nose for internet because we
   don't buy their cable package, which doesn't cost much more than just
   internet. Other providers are all around us because of developments
   that have sprung up (we live out in the county), but no one else has
   come up the two roads that meet at the corner we live on (there's a
   phone company box right there, so it seems like they could easily offer
   their service, which is much cheaper, but what do I know?)

   I don't really feel deprived as far as what to watch because TV is such
   a time drain (but also welcome opiate at the end of long day), and we
   have access to more than enough even with glitchy streaming -- just
   feeling screwed because of what we have to pay to be on line.

 Comcast and Verizon and satellite are in our area ([377]0+ / 0-)
       and we have Verizon for phone/internet and Comcast for TV. I like
       it that way, even though it costs me more.
       I don't like the channels available on FIOS, and I don't want my
       internet impacted by the streaming users who I know are in the
       apartment building near me and most likely on cable.
       I say that because our cable quality can vary greatly, from great
       to kinda sucky, but my internet is always good.
       I get about 800 channels on Comcast, but in essence it's 100
       channels 3 times, a bunch of premium channels (HBO, Showtime, etc)
       that I don't get, a bunch of music channels that I don't listen to,
       a bunch of international channels that I don't subscribe to, adult
       channels I don't want, and a ton of pay sports stuff that I don't
       get.
       So in actuality I've got about 150 unique stations, including
       multiple ESPNs, religious channels, shopping channels, and the
       broadcast channels for our area and Philly.
       If I could pay for just what I want, I'd happily pay for a
       selection of 150 HD channels, pick the ones that we actually might
       want to watch, and forget the other 300+ that  are either
       duplicates or stuff I don't want and/or don't want to pay for.
       Hell, if I could get those 150 for a decent amount, I might even
       spring for HBO and Showtime.

   Claimed they didn't have anything like that there.

   Same thing with a neighbor. But when he told them he was cutting the

   Basically, ESPN says, all of your customers get ESPN, or none do.

   How valuable is ESPN to Disney?

       There was a report which stated that the fees for the NFL and the
       like are so high, that everyone who pays a cable bill are
       subsidizing sports whether they watch or not.  In that respect Ala
       carte would be good because subscribers would have to pay for the
       channels they want, and there would be no bleeding.
       OTOH, it is my impression that many cable subscribers only are
       interested in a particular channel, either ESPN or Fox.  These
       offer the live shows that people want to live and are not going to
       just look on the internet the next day, either because they don't
       know how or the content is not valuable enough.
       What no law is going to prevent is deals in which going a la cart
       for particular channels is much more expensive than just buying the
       channels in a package.  For instance, HBO with a package might be
       half as much as HBO a la carte.

 Conservatives disagree with ([492]0+ / 0-)
       all of your first paragraph, obviously; and sports enthusiasts
       would disagree with all of your second, or at least they would
       claim that they don't want to watch your channels, either, so why
       should they pay for yours? Structurally, the argument is the same,
       which is what I'm pointing out. Nobody needs entertainment
       (although psychologists and sociologists might argue vehemently
       against that statement, too) at all, but that's an irrelevance to
       my point.
       Why shouldn't we have the same type of fee structure for our
       entertainment as we do for our other societal goods and common
       services? Why can't we all be in that together, too?
       1) If the costs are too high, there's a market problem, but who's
       to say the costs are too high (microeconomic theoretically
       speaking) in the first place? 2) As Adam B and others point out
       throughout the diary, there is no evidence whatsoever that "a la
       carting" tv will actually lower the price of anything to the
       consumer . . .

   I pay $267/month for cable TV, my Internet connection, and VOIP phone.
   I get every cable channel possible. I watch like 10 of them. But I have
   to buy them all so I can get things like the History Channel 2. The
   Science Channel. All the ESPN channels.

   I'd give just about anything to pick and choose what I get.

       If I could get the half dozen channels I want for under $50 (beyond

   Netflix is the best $7.99 a month we spend.  Our kids seem to find an
   inexhaustible amount of entertainment from it and it can stream to
   their tablets, xbox, etc.  They never ask to watch the TV that has
   cable, even though they are allowed.  I think that I might cut the
   cable again if there was some sort of "netflix plus" for maybe $20 a
   month with expanded content.  I don't really care if I watch things as
   they are broadcast.  I usually record shows anyway.

   I think that is one of the biggest changes that the cable companies
   face.  We were raised watching broadcast and cable TV.  My kids don't
   understand the concept.  Like you said, they find stuff online and

   that's not really an option -- more and more sports are going the

   till probably the finals, NHL playoffs are cable till Game 3 of the
   Finals, and we're lucky if we get one Giants game a week on the
   over-air channel). About the only holdout is NFL, and I can't see that
   lasting much longer; someone is going to offer the league a boatload of
   money for exclusive access. And $200/month for TV and cable is cheaper
   than going to a sports bar to watch a game that you can't even hear

       Here in North Port, Fl. we can only get Comcast.  Verizon committed
       to build out FIOS some years ago, but is reneging on that promise.
        Embarq, or whatever it's called now is only in a small part of the
       city.  Comcast has made it cheaper to buy wireless and basic trash
       TV than wireless alone.  This, I conclude is an attempt to staunch
       the outflow of cable TV customers.  I wonder if Comcast is doing
       something for Verizon in order to keep them out of North Port.

   even though I'd had DSL for ages.

   They were upgrading the local area, and I hadn't responded to any of
   their 'upgrade now!' offers.

   So they sent a guy to my house, who made me an offer I couldn't refuse
   - free installation (inside and out), free router, lower monthly cost,
   faster internet.

   He practically begged me, because I was screwing up their upgrade
   process, since I still had an old copper connection.

   That offer I took. My phone/internet bill dropped $50, and I have more

   [906]Surowiecki:

     The simple argument for unbundling is: "If I pay sixty dollars for a
     hundred channels, I'd pay a fraction of that for sixteen channels."
     But that's not how à-la-carte pricing would work. Instead, the
     prices for individual channels would soar, and the providers, who
     wouldn't be facing any more competition than before, would tweak
     prices, perhaps on a customer-by-customer basis, to maintain their
     revenue. That doesn't necessarily mean that Bravo would suddenly
     cost fifteen dollars a month, but there's little evidence to suggest
     that à-la-carte packages would be generally cheaper than the current
     bundles. One recent paper on the subject, in fact, estimated the
     best-case gain to consumers at thirty-five cents a month. But even
     if it wasn't a boon to consumers an à-la-carte system would inject
     huge uncertainty into the cable business, and many cable networks
     wouldn't get enough subscribers to survive. That's a future that the
     industry would like to avoid.

     So far, the task hasn't been too difficult, in part because
     consumers haven't shown much unbundling fervor. If there were
     sizable demand for à la carte, you'd expect at least one of cable's
     competitors, like DirecTV, Dish Network, or Verizon's FiOS, to offer
     it, but none do. You'd also think that, as bundles have grown more
     expensive, and as building your own TV experience has become
     easier--by watching online, downloading from iTunes, and getting
     high-definition network broadcasts via antenna--cable and satellite
     would have got less popular. But subscriptions continue to grow.

     Some of this, presumably, is just inertia. But it's also true that
     consumers often find bundles appealing. Many popular consumer
     products, like the iPhone, are bundles, as are newspapers and
     magazines: you buy the whole thing, not only the articles you want
     to read. TV networks themselves are bundles: if you subscribe to HBO
     (a channel that cable systems do offer à la carte), you pay for all
     its shows. Consumers also seem to like another form of bundling;
     namely, flat-rate pricing. At Disneyland, people used to pay an
     admission fee and then buy tickets for individual rides. But in 1982
     Disney introduced all-in-one pricing, and attendance rose. Likewise,
     people buy gym memberships instead of paying by the visit, prefer
     all-in-one calling plans, and vehemently oppose the idea of metered
     Internet access.

     The appeal of bundling is partly that it reduces transaction costs:
     instead of having to figure out how much each part of a package is
     worth to you, you can make a blanket judgment. Bundling eliminates
     the problem of fretting about small expenditures, which may be one
     reason that flat-rate pricing is very common in the vacation
     industry (cruise ships, all-inclusive travel packages, and so on).
     It also offers what economists call option value: you may never
     watch those sixty other channels, but the fact that you could if you
     wanted to is worth something.

       [940]1-26-2013:

     Say you pay $60 a month for your cable package. Lots of channels
     come with the package, but you really only watch MSNBC, the Food
     Network, SyFy, Bravo, and USA. Sure, every once in a while you flip
     to Fox to see hilarious conservative coverage of Obama speaking, and
     every couple of years you watch a few Olympic events on other cable
     networks. And perhaps from time to time scrolling the channels you
     find yourself watching a Law & Order rerun on TNT. And, okay, you've
     seen a few reality shows here and there on other channels. But if
     you could keep getting the broadcast networks without needing to
     futz with an antenna and watch MSNBC, the Food Network, SyFy, Bravo,
     and USA you'd be happy. So why can't you ditch the sports networks
     and get a discount?

     Well, because the hypothesis here is that you're already paying $60
     a month for a cable package that really only offers five channels
     you watch. You would rather have access to those five channels than
     have $60. So since those channels are worth $60 to you, even if
     unbundling happens your cable provider is going to find a way to
     charge you approximately $60 for them. Because at the end of the
     day, you're paying your cable provider for access to the channels
     you do watch--not for access to the channels you don't watch. The
     channels you don't watch are just there. If the channels you do
     watch are worth $60 to you, then $60 is what you'll pay for them.
     What would change the game here isn't unbundling, it's competition.
     If a typical neighborhood was served by a dozen different cable
     providers, then consumers could get a much better deal. But that's
     the problem with the telecom market--there's very little
     competition, so you end up getting screwed. But the bundling isn't
     what's screwing you.

       Sadly, all the evidence I've seen suggests that the end result
       would be that each channel would be more expensive, and that we'd
       end up narrowing our choices without actually getting any price
       break. It would also make it much harder to get new channels off
       the ground, if they had to immediately get people to sign up for
       them.

       if it were to go a la carte - there is only so much the market
       could / would pay - at such point there are diminishing returns.
       Advertisers pay for viewers - if you don't have the numbers - you
       can't charge big $$$ for ad time.
       When Monday Night Football was moved from ABC to sister ESPN on
       cable was that ESPN had two revenue streams (ad and subscriber)
       where ABC only had ad.
       I could turn ALL TV to pay TV - who knows.
       I think small networks would still do OK - a la carte would kill of
       a bunch of channels - but ones that aren't sustainable.

     It would also make it much harder to get new channels off the
     ground, if they had to immediately get people to sign up for them.
       When I had a c-band satellite system (big dish), I was able to
       subscribe to individual channels on an a la carte basis.  When new
       channels became available, they would be offered free of cost for a
       limited period (six months to a year, typically) to allow me to
       sample that channel.  At the end of the free period, the channel
       would start charging and I would decide whether to pay for it or
       let that channel go blank.
       No reason why the same system couldn't work today.

   We've already shown we're willing to pay the all-in rate for the

   when, for example, you have just the networks you want a la carte, and
   then you go to the Internet for anything like what you just described -
   the Faux Noise lies, the occasional other channel, and your provider
   may just bill you on a per-episode basis, like after 5 minutes you're
   charged a buck like an iTunes selection that you purchase after you
   test a song for a few seconds.

   Commercials will probably be an option as well - pay something to have
   the content without commercials or pay nothing or a slight amount if
   you have the commercials transmitted.

   TV and watching patterns won't stay the same way they are now, but I'd
   be happy to have the option of unbundling.  I'd probably also watch
   less because currently I do channel surf and if I have less chance of
   finding an old episode, I'm more likely to turn off the box or come

       start a cable channel and on demand, pay-per-view and video stores
       were all hot commodities, there was much talk in the cable industry
       that cable would be dead within 10 years.
       Here we all are 20 years later having the same conversation.  While
       there are certain times where self programming is definitely the
       model for consumption and certain people don't want or need
       programmed channels - the reality is that the majority of people
       aren't willing to do that much work.
       Here's an example:  I don't read 20 political blogs a day, for
       instance.  I come here where there are a variety of topics and a
       fair amount of content and sometimes I go to a few others - but
       that's usually when I'm looking for something that hasn't been
       covered here.  It is your "programming" that makes this blog
       attractive to me.
       Some days I listen to music that I've selected and programmed and
       other times I want someone else to entertain me.
       I argued that cable was not dead 20 years ago and stand by the same
       assertion today.  It isn't that things haven't changed, but they
       actually haven't changed that much.
       Finally, for the real switch over to the internet a la carte model
       to happen if people want to watch anything other than reruns, there
       has to be a way for producers of content to make money - and that's
       still a shaky model at best.
       ...AND we have to get really high-speed and robust bandwidth that
       could handle the live streaming traffic that switch would represent
       into far more households in this country than is currently
       available.  We don't have that now.
       Even then, you'd end up with more successful outlets on the
       internet offering a programming line ups - because people don't
       want to have to think all the time.  It is just human nature.

 Almost everyone has 2 or 3 options already ([1097]0+ / 0-)

   ... at least.  Even if they don't cut the cord, almost everyone has the
   option of one cable company and DirecTV and/or Dish.

   Not everyone has the additional options of U-Verse or FiOS, but some do
   and more will within a few years.

   In my neighborhood, FiOS isn't an option yet, but the choices are TWC,
   DirecTV, Dish, and U-Verse.

   Why not have a system where all of those providers offer the
   alternative of subscribing to channels either unbundled or bundled with
   other channels, and then let the marketplace sort it out.  It won't be
   perfect, but it will be better.

       Tech TV was great. It got bought and dumbed down into G4 TV. Now G4

       Being forced to find other distribution and funding might help some

 Sorry, but this is nonsense ([1212]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1213]mariva

   Right now, the contracts that providers sign with the networks prevent
   them from unbundling and offering a la carte service.  So if, say,
   DISH, wished to compete by offering a la carte service, they are
   precluded from doing so by the handful of companies that own all of the
   major cable networks.

   The other weakness with this anti-a la carte argument is that it
   assumes that costs are static, which is just not the case.  While some
   costs are fixed, many are not -- notably, the rights fees that are paid
   for sporting events can go up or down.  If an a la carte world reduces
   revenue for sports networks substantially, one might reasonably expect
   that the rights fees paid to the sporting leagues would eventually
   drop.  Somehow, a la carte opponents always want to act like this won't
   happen, and that the same fixed costs would be spread amongst fewer
   viewers.

       cost closer to $60/month.
       You have to calculate losses including not being able to tell
       advertisers that they are in 85% of households guaranteed.  So, you
       have to factor in the ad revenue losses and consider the fact that
       none of their other production costs and licensing fees would have
       changed.
       Finally, there is the cable company's cut of the cost to consumer
       that has to be factored in - all of their call centers, billing
       operations, technicians, etc.  That cost would be an additional
       charge.
       And then there's the possibility that the cable companies could go
       to an entirely on demand pay-per-view model and that would be
       expensive beyond your wildest dreams.  Prohibitively so
       particularly for the elderly.
       So, the a la carte model could send cable tv prices sky-rocketingly
       high very quickly.

       right to force to consumers to rent a cable box - among other not

   bill - especially in this corporate-friendly Congress - will reduce
   what people pay for cable service.  It is much more likely that it will
   only reduce what people get in terms of channel selection for about the
   same cost.

   So... If you want to pay about the same amount for five or ten channels
   instead of 100, then have at it.  OR if you want to pay per view
   everything you watch, then there's that possibility, too.

       The one and only reason that I could argue in favor of the a la

       My desire to rid my channel list of the religious channels and the
       shopping networks is about actively rejecting those channels in a
       way that is recorded by the industry; not about whether or not I
       have to surf through them or see them on the general listings.
       In the old days before there were favorites lists, I would set them
       up to be blocked with the function meant to allow parents to shield
       their kids from programming they didn't want them to see.  I don't
       bother to do that now because I don't have to and because it isn't
       being tracked by the cable company - if they were recording that
       data, I'd totally be blocking all of those channels just to send my
       personal political message.

       Channels like ESPN would cost a lot more than people would ever

   The reason why cable companies don't want to move to a la carte is that
   they stand to lose billions, because by bundling the popular cable
   channels with other garbage, they are able to charge you tons of money
   because consumers have been willing to pay up.

   Now, that's changing as people just drop cable altogether.  MLB
   actually does offer games online already, and it's a great deal for the
   whole season.

   Though, don't think this will save you tons and tons of money per
   month.  Cable companies will just charge you $10/month for ESPN,
   $5/month for each of the 4 major networks, etc. etc., so that your bill
   will probably end up pretty much the same anyway.

       Streaming online will ultimately be the death of cable - it's just

       Cable companies where a necessary middle man for years because they
       provided the "hardware" to get the programming to the home.
       The internet - which is free - is now the "hardware".  Customers
       have their own "boxes" (their computers) and pay for the circuit
       (ISP) - all Disney has to provide is content - it's all they
       provide now - except through the cable / sat middleman.
       This will mean more revenue for Disney - less for Cablevision.
       AT&T and Verizon have strong positions since they are using their
       ISP as a middleman service which basically, won't be necessary if /
       when the content providers go direct....but at least Verizon and
       AT&T will still have the ISP business.

   technically, it's going to be a lot harder to just allow certain people
   certain channels.

   Right now, they just throw everything at you and your cable box makes
   the distinction. There are few options - you get this group, or this
   group + x, or this group + y.  It checks your account and you get x, y,
   or z.

   Allowing ala carte would mean that they'd have to do a lot more on the
   back end to make sure that you got the right grouping of channels. It's
   possible, but would require more setup all the way around.

   We dropped DirecTV a few years ago because of the expense and the
   annoyance of having to sort through hundreds of channels of garbage,
   trying to find something worth watching, while often not succeeding.
   There are a few shows we watch, and I am willing to pay for the content
   I want to see. Right now we buy about four TV series on iTunes to watch
   whenever we want, commercial free.

   This way we are paying far, far less per year than we did with a
   monthly bill to watch the same few shows. But it's not as easy (or
   reliable) as having cable and a DVR, and you have to be much more
   proactive in searching out new stuff that may be worthwhile. So I think
   I would be happy to pay about the same amount we're currently paying to
   get just the few channels on cable. I really disliked those extra
   hundreds of uwatched channels cluttering up my menus. I think the
   pay-for-what-you-want model would be an improvement. But not if it
   still costs a hundred dollars a month to get 5 channels. That would
   mean sticking with iTunes and Netflix.

   But it is also true that you could see people subscribing to more
   channels individually.  So if I pay $60 currently I may be still
   willing to pay the same $60 for a selected grouping that includes
   channels I don't have already.  The benefit to me - I don't have to set
   up favorites to ignore the 90% of the channels I will never watch.  And
   I probably will sacrifice a whole slew of channels for one that I don't
   have but would really like on it's own.

   That said, I am seeing more options today than previously.  I think I
   can add HBO alone - where I used to have to jump up in service and
   include others (I think).  But as it is I won't add HBO to the cost of
   my bundle.  I would probably sacrifice more than 1/2 my current
   channels to obtain HBO for the same price.

    I think requiring cable companies to go a la carte is not a great
   idea.  Ensuring that there is competition that will do the same thing.
    With competition you will get a la carte.  And if I am comfortable
   spending $60 I will probably pick and choose my channels to get to that
   $60.  But if I want vast array of choice to satisfy my surfing needs
   then I can bundle and "save" on a price per channel basis.

       I think that is the biggest impediment to a la carte programming in
       the short and long term.
       Content creators are the networks, and they are more than happy
       with the current system.  And they also hold all the leverage
       because they are creating the popular shows that customers demand.
       This is why you're seeing Netflix produce their own shows now, with
       House of Cards and picking up Arrested Development.  They are
       becoming their own content creator and giving subscribers a reason
       to keep subscribing even when costs go up because the networks are
       fucking them over with exorbitant license fees and all.
       If the networks were smart and innovative the past decade (and
       really 5 years), they would have all done their own streaming
       service so that you can watch their own shows a la carte.  But they
       must not have thought the market was there, which is why they all
       licensed TV shows and movies to netflix for dirt cheap in netflix's
       infancy.

   The biggest complaint I have is that there aren't enough choices in the
   bundles they offer, either in size or mix of channels - you are offered
   $XX for 13 channels, not including your favorite local sports team, or
   you have to pay $XXX for 250 channels including your sports team, plus
   way too much other garbage you couldn't care less about.  There is no
   package in between too few and way too much, and you don't get to
   choose which channels are in your package.

   What if there was an a la carte bundle you could build according to
   your price point and preferences?  A "basket" of a certain size, which
   you can fill up with whatever you want.  So I could choose a
   13-channel, 25-channel, 60-channel, 150-channel package, or whatever
   level I am willing to pay for, and then I can fill up my package with
   whatever channels I want, instead of a set list. Different channels
   could be weighted according to their expense.  So maybe in the
   13-channel package you get five expensive channels of your choice, five
   medium-expense, and 3 startup channels. Seems like this would cover the
   expensive ESPNs of the world, and also leave room for new channels to
   build a viewership.

       You could even have it where you got lineup A, plus 5 channels you
       choose. Or a larger package where you got lineup B, plus 10
       channels you choose.
       The channels you choose could include one premium channel at the

       This would give you SOME choices, and maybe please some people who

   Obviously it went nowhere.

   I've got a much better idea. Do to the cable companies what was done to
   Ma Bell. Make the cable lines public and allow telecom companies to
   compete for business. It would create the conditions for lower prices
   and better service.

   It's time for the cable monopolies to go.

       I have a cable box that uses archaic technology in my living room.
       My smart phone has exponentially more computing power and doesn't
       heat up to 130 degrees. And of course my saved shows are stored
       locally in my cable box. Why hasn't TWC discovered the concept of
       cloud computing? Why does it take 10 seconds for my cable box to
       respond to my remote and why do I have to stand directly in front
       of the box for it to work at all.
       Why does it take 30 minutes to reach a representative when I call
       TWC to complain about a (frequent) problem with my service? Why
       does it take three weeks to get a repairman to come to my house?

   For instance, mlb.com give the season pass (every game) for $129.  But

   If you're really into local sports that aren't on free tv (like seeing

   This is why the cable companies have me by the scrotum: 75% of what I
   watch is live sports, and 75% of that is live local sports. If NESN
   ever starts live streaming, I might be able to dump cable, but I'm not
   holding my breath, and I got to have my Red Sox and Bruins :).

   In fact, cable is about to tighten its grip on my scrotum. The English
   Premier League is switching in August from Fox Soccer (which I don't
   get) and the one measly game a week on ESPN (which I watch religiously)
   to the various NBC channels, all of which I get. So, now, besides the
   Red Sox and Bruins, I'll be tethered to my cable by Liverpool :D.

   And, yes, I agree with Adam B's comments above about how a la carte
   wouldn't work because they'd jack the prices up. One thing he didn't
   mention is how they spread these things out--and how NBC is going to do
   the Premier League (and how they currently do the NHL playoffs and
   especially the Olympics) is a good example. So, you want the soccer.
   So, you pay 10 bucks for your local NBC affiliate and 10 bucks for NBC
   Sports Channel. You're all set, right? Not so fast, my friend. Some of
   the games are going to be on CNBC. Or MSNBC. The NHL playoffs are,
   right now, using CNBC for some games--and the Olympics uses all those
   plus USA and Bravo. So, if I don't want to go broke, and Liverpool is
   on CNBC and NBC Sports is showing Wigan-Newcastle, I'm shit out of
   luck.

   ex-ballplayer buddy on the Peninsula, and we can all commiserate

       check out the #SFGiants hashtag during games -- there are so many
       fangirls with assorted players as their "husbands" you'd think the
       team played in Utah, and there are some fairly witty (and pithy)
       commenters who can get a lot in 140 characters.

   that the cable companies will do some nonsense like $20 for 1 channel,
   or $22 for 14 channels and then state the infrastructure requirements
   are the same no matter what and that's the bulk of the cost. It would
   end up being just as costly to have 5 a la carte channels as it would
   125 (albeit a lot easier on the remote thumb).

   Whatever, choices are still better than no choices. Let's break up

       things--the Olympics especially, but the Premier League might end
       up being close--they use six channels--NBC, NBC Sports, CNBC,

   I am a NY Mets fan and when they play the SF Giants whether in NY or

   Chicago Cubs games with SF Giants?

   This year I switched from getting the games on the TV to getting them
   on my computers, iPad and iPhone.  Cheaper in the end.  However, same

       blackout rules are the most annoying thing ever.  I believe every
       team claims a home area and one can only view those games on
       something other than the contracted channel if they live outside
       that area.
       There was an article somewhere, maybe fangraphs, that showed how
       ridiculous the rules were and that there was an area out in the
       mountain region that was claimed by a half dozen teams and because
       no local carrier any of the channels, was in a virtual permanent
       blackout.
       Furthermore I believe all games are blacked out on Saturday because
       of the contract with Fox regardless of whether Fox is carrying the
       game or not.  I'm also a Met fan and I remember a few years ago a
       game wasn't broadcast by anyone one saturday because Fox claimed it
       as one of their regional broadcasts and then ended up showing
       another game on the east coast.

       Yeah, I hate that because I live in Sacramento where Fox usually

 I thought about getting MLB Premium ([1864]0+ / 0-)
       this year, but the blackout rules killed me -- I'm not always at
       home and I'd love to be able to catch an inning or two of Giants or
       A's on my iPhone when Mr. Scribe and I are out running errands in
       the car or when we're visiting his mom but can't because of the
       blackout rule.
       The reason many teams have gone to playing evening games on
       Saturdays is to get around the "FOX Window" -- FOX has exclusive
       rights to televise games between, I think, noon and 3pm Pacific so
       any game that starts in that timeframe that's not on FOX is blacked
       out. By playing evening games, they get around that restriction so
       can have their own local broadcasts.

 How about doing something about Infomercials? ([1883]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1884]webranding, [1885]nellgwen

   The reason we got rid of cable was because I was tired of paying for
   commercials (and extra for HD).

   We live in an urban city, and we have an HD antenna.  On top of that,
   we have excellent broadband, so we can watch pretty much any tv show or
   movie or sports whenever we want.  And it only costs about $50 a month
   for high speed internet.

   Most people I know pay over $120 a month for tv/internet/home phone.
   But the future is moving away from that.

   I can't tell you how many times I'd flip thru the channels only to find
   infomercials everywhere.  Maybe I stay up late, but what am I paying
   for exactly if that's mostly all that's on?

       channels. But I do agree with others' comments that the content
       owners would jack up the prices so high that the effective bill
       would be the same or just barely under.

   so this is off the top of my head. I am a huge sports guy. But ESPN and
   the cost you might pay as a non-sports fan for me to get that channel,
   is mind blowing. Close to 15% of your cable bill.  A few channels, ESPN
   at the top, are the majority of your cable bill. Channels I like not so
   much, but I have to pay an arm and a leg to get them.

       For fuck's sake.  This is relatively ancient technology.  Even
       satellite TV is two decades old.  Not only is the infrastructure in
       place, it's been fully amortized for YEARS.
       As for content cost, that's just bullshit, too.
       I don't disagree with AdamB above, about costs staying high no
       matter whether ala carte or bundled.  But look.  It's trivially
       easy and inexpensive to put high-speed internet access in every
       home in the country, and it's fucking absurd that your
       communications bill (phone/internet/cable/mobile, whatever) winds
       up costing as much as your health insurance does.

   get local broadcasting because of the trees so I get the New York and

   I get a gazillion channels but fortunately can at least edit down my
   channel guide to the channels I actually watch. Fox "News" hasn't
   appeared in my guide for many years.

   Very expensive, but there are a few shows I do enjoy. I was going to
   cancel it a couple of years ago when my health insurance premium jumped
   $60 per month, but a friend has taken over the payments. He watches my
   TV more than I do anyway and he doesn't have electricity at his house

   Recommended by:
          [2131]nellgwen

   What happens to small marginal networks like Free Speech TV? If not
   enough people choose it, would it get dumped altogether? (Less of a
   problem now for PBS thanks to shows like Downton Abbey, though I wish
   our local outlets were still showing old Doctor Who -- just can't get
   into the shiny new stuff.)

   I'm probably like you, Markos -- I'd get mostly sports stuff (the
   ESPNs, NBC Sports, local Comcast sports channels, and MLB/NHL/NFL
   Networks; maybe add in NBA Network because I'm starting to get
   interested in round ball with the current run of the Warriors in the
   playoffs). Local stations for network coverage and local news (I worry
   that we spend so much time on what's going on around the world that we
   ignore to our peril what's going on around the corner). Probably MSNBC
   for breaking national stuff, and CNBC because NBC sticks a lot of
   sports stuff there they don't want cluttering the Mothership (like the
   NHL playoffs). And I'll keep my HBO and Showtime for their special
   stuff, though if we get our new SmartTV I'll likely watch entertainment
   shows even less since I'll be able to get Netflix and Hulu Plus via
   WiFi -- our old CRT is starting to flatline (literally -- gets a flat
   line on the screen and have to let it warm up a bit before it
   disappears).

   Maybe if networks put up better programming, they wouldn't have to
   worry about being dumped; I remember when Discovery Networks had actual
   informative programming rather than Real Housewives of Wherever and all
   the other crap shows. (Still miss "In A Fix" the most -- Sparky the
   electrician was smoking hot.)

 that's really not the case ([2205]0+ / 0-)

   There are newly broadcast shows that aren't available on Hulu (or Hulu
   Plus) and they won't be available on Netflix until at least the next
   season. I like Person of Interest and Mentalist, neither on Hulu last
   time I checked a few months ago. CBS doesn't even offer them on demand
   on cable like they do their other shows, although I believe they do
   offer them on their website. But why bother having a big screen TV and
   comfortable couch if you end up hunched over your computer at a desk to
   watch your favorite shows? Also, you can't watch Game of Thrones
   without cable. Of course you can download all this stuff illegally off
   the newsgroups, but I prefer the legal option.

   I hate watching sports on TV (it's fun to go to a game though) and
   would nix every sports channel if it was an option. ESPN is one of the
   most expensive channels subsidized in a cable bill. Verizon Fios even
   requires us to pay an extra approx $3 fee every month for some stupid
   regional sports channel requirement. It's an actual line item on the
   bill. We can get a package with no sports fee, but it only has the most
   basic of channels.

       these days, it's cheaper to pay the cable bill than to go to as
       many sporting events as we watch. Doesn't mean I'm tethered to the
       boob tube -- thanks to StubHub I've been able to score some fairly
       cheap tickets (especially on weekdays now that Mr. Scribe is
       retired), but when we have to bail due to unforeseen circumstances
       (like a couple of weeks ago when my mother-in-law ended up in the
       hospital after a mild stroke) it's nice to know that I've still got
       the game available on TV to watch. As for hockey, we're talking
       about $100 per game (tickets about $40 each, then $20 for parking).
       Plus watching at home means no annoying fans in front or behind us,
       cheaper beer and shorter bathroom lines. ;-)
       I can watch TV and still have a life -- the two are not mutually

   Don't have the exact info in front of me but there's a chart floating

   HGTV cost maybe .25.

   cursory search found this:

   [2229]ESPN Is The Biggest Reason Your Cable Bill Is So Expensive

     According to estimates obtained by Sam Schechner and Martin Peers of
     The Wall Street Journal, ESPN charges cable companies $4.69 per
     subscriber per month. That is the highest rate for any cable company
     and up 42 percent in the last five years. For comparison, the
     average cable channel charges just 26 cents per subscriber per
     month, up only 24 percent during the same period.

     An executive with the company that owns the Starz network recently
     called ESPN "a tax on every American household."

   Recommended by:
          [2269]pasadena beggar, [2270]nellgwen, [2271]Miggles

   Another reason to get rid of the old cable model with the changes
   proposed by McCain is all the damage being caused by subsidizing
   hundreds of cable channels  hardly anyone watches.

   I mean seriously, we all hate hate Fox, but if you have a cable or
   satellite TV subscription, you're paying Fox News money each month,
   even if you keep the channel blocked on your TV, you still pay them.

   How much money is there in those cable fees from tens and hundreds of
   millions of people who never watch your channel? Enough that at least 2
   broadcast channels were  ALREADY thinking before the Aereo case of
   switching to becoming a Cable channel. Because sure, they'll lose
   millions of viewers, but the cable fees from tens and hundreds of
   millions of people who NEVER watch your shows will more then make up
   for the losses.

   How does that make any sense? You get LESS customers, and therefore
   make LESS money for the commercials you show, yet you're STILL making
   more money?!?

   Such a business model can only be kept up for so long, it's inevitable
   that cable subscriptions are going to plummet VERY soon, just like
   Newspaper subscriptions did. For over a decade we were warned the
   newspapers are in trouble, but the papers were making more money then
   ever! Then almost over night papers started folding and going out of
   business one after the other, and now newspapers are making like 1/10th
   of what they used to make from ads in their papers.

   We don't get cable TV service at all, but we do get our internet

   As it happens, you can get online access to cable networks if you
   subscribe to them through the cable provider, so...
   we decided that we'd be willing to spend some money to get BBC America.
   We'd probably save a few dollars on Dr. Who, Sherlock, and Top Gear and
   gain access to other things as well.

   But, as it turns out, even thought the cable company reps told me I
   could do what I wanted to do (and I told them the tier I was looking at
   and the cable service that I received), by the time it came down to
   placing an actual order, there was nothing available for less than
   twice our current monthly fees.

   This affects me not a bit, since I "cut the cord" about two years ago
   and have never looked back.  I have an HD antenna plugged into an EyeTV
   USB dongle that allows me to use my computer as a DVR (I can even
   program it with an onscreen guide) and I stream over Netflix.

   That said, this is only going to squeeze out the smaller players in
   terms of channels and the studios that produce the content for the
   channels.  Where does it stop?  Today we're complaining that we have to
   pay for a bunch of channels we never watch.  Next, it will be
   complaining that we pay for a bunch of shows on those channels that we
   never watch.  So why not just buy the shows individually?

   Well, we can already do that, so I see no incentive to the cable cos to
   give the intermediary step.  And you may not watch ESPN even though you
   pay for it, but the people who watch ESPN pay for a bunch of channels
   they never watch.  Will MSNBC survive on a per-subscriber basis?  Will
   it have to shift to a more profitable ideology?

   Anything like Current TV will have no chance whatsoever, so forget
   about it.  Right now the blockbuster channels pay for the less-viewed
   ones, and I imagine that it's the channels more popular with the
   DailyKos crowd that will be the ones that go away the fastest.  TCM?
   Logo?  The History Channel?  I would not imagine they'd be long for an
   a la carte world.  ESPN?  Fox News?  Not going anywhere.

   And I highly doubt there will be much, if any, decrease in price.  You
   can only watch one thing at a time - so essentially you're not paying
   for channels, you're paying to have TV content in your home 24/7.
   Whether you select from 5 channels or 500, you're still getting 24
   hours of content per day, max.

   Like I said, I don't really have a horse in this race, except that I
   enjoy content that is quite obviously "subsidized" by cable packaging
   which I imagine will go away (most everything I enjoy has been canceled
   or is nearing the end of its run, anyway).  This is just a way for
   fewer people to make even more money, all under the guise of "consumer
   choice".

   We already pay for only the channels we watch.  Whether there are 5 you
   don't watch or 500 you don't watch, it's foolish to think that your
   overall price will come down at all.  All that will happen is that
   there will be fewer choices, and fewer things that are not "sure bets"
   will be made, and the already-successful entities will end up with an
   even bigger share of a shrinking market.

   It's no wonder at all John McCain supports it and it's disappointing to
   see he has support here.  No one will save any money on this deal - it
   will just continue to squeeze out the smaller players.

 Oh, and by the way, I don't WANT to ([2353]0+ / 0-)
       watch TV on my computer, I want to watch TV on my TV.
       This legislation should also have some hard language about customer
       service and the failure of Comcast, for one example, in that area.

 Congress...more of this ([2357]0+ / 0-)

   I wish more Congresscritters would focus on some of this sort of stuff.
    It seems small, but it makes a big difference in the cost of living
   for some people.  I say this even as someone that doesn't have cable at
   my house (I have internet).  I think people would have a much better
   opinion of Congress and govt if they see things that really help their
   lives.  I do hope some Dems join in this and it is bi-partisan.

   The other big missed opportunity that had bi-partisan support was the
   HomeStar program that would have provided home owners support for
   energy efficiency upgrades.  It would have helped cut utility bills,
   lowered energy usage, and provided decent jobs.  Not sure what happened
   to that one.  Again, it would have been something that provided
   immediate impact for a home owner and for those hired to do the work.

   The sequester is the new Republican immigration reform plan. Make
   things so bad here in the US that no one will want to live here.

 Part of the reason ([2360]0+ / 0-)

   I am about to cancel my cable, I ha e already cancelled wireless phone
   service, $100 per month is to rich for m blood, same for cable, being
   unemployed for over 1 months I am looking for as many savings as I can
   find.

 I totally agree. I have Comcast (in the North Bay) ([2363]0+ / 0-)

   And as a rabid SF Giants fan am forced to sign up for another tier in
   order to watch CSN Bay Area where most of the Giants games are
   broadcast. We used to like to watch Turner Classic Movies but realized
   we were paying $35.00 more for TCM and a bunch of Garbage (like
   religious programming); TCM was the only channel we watched in that
   "Bundle". We dropped it.
