[23]New York City fast food workers stage another, larger strike

   Strikers outside a New York City Burger King that was not able to open
   on April 4, 2013.
   Fast food workers in New York City are following up their [30]November
   action with another one-day strike, held on the anniversary of Martin
   Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. The November strike involved about
   200 workers across the city--a record--and today's is expected to be
   larger.

   "We'll have double the number of strikers, four or five hundred workers
   on strike, and double the locations too," Jonathan Westin, executive
   director of New York Communities for Change, one of the groups
   organizing the Fast Food Forward campaign, [31]told Sarah Jaffe. "We
   will have several stores where it will not just be minority strikes
   like it was last time, we will have the majority of workers at several
   stores out on strikes, making it hard for them to do business on this
   day." That prediction has held true at at least one restaurant:

   6am. All the workers are striking. It's still closed. #fastfoodfwd

   Workers, many making the minimum wage of $7.25 and few making more than
   $9.00, are fighting for a wage of $15.00. One worker, who [36]hasn't
   gotten a raise above minimum wage in four years of work, told Steven
   Greenhouse:

     "I'm behind on paying my cable and Con Ed bills," said Ms. Verges,
     whose Burger King is at 141st Street and Broadway. "I don't think
     $15 an hour is asking too much. I do it all. I do three or four
     jobs. I take orders, I make the orders. I work the cash register. I
     say, `Have a good day.' I do the inventory. I take out the trash. I
     get down and scrub the floor. I don't think $7.25 is nearly enough."

   Josh Eidelson spoke to [37]KFC worker Joe Barrera:

     Barrera, who's paid the $7.25 minimum wage, said that a decent raise
     would allow him to stop skipping meals and start pursuing college.
     "Maybe I could afford to have a girlfriend, take her out on a date
     ..." he added. "All of that money goes right now to just surviving."

   Some workers reported retaliation, including firing, after the November
   strike, but community groups, clergy, and politicians joined the
   workers to protest, getting a worker fired from Wendy's for striking
   quickly reinstated. Most retaliation the workers face is more subtle
   than immediate firing, but clearly this campaign has only gained steam
   since it became public in November.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [54]Tagging tips - [55]Search For Tags - [56]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       There is NO excuse for other overwhelmingly Democratic cities
       failing to follow suit.
       Now, that's not to excuse our Representatives from their
       responsibility to raise the Federal Minimum Wage, but think about
       how much easier that will be if tens of millions of Americans are
       already living in substantially higher wage states and cities?
       NY State just raised Minimum wage to 9.00, but it's not in effect
       yet.  NYC should be able to do much, much better since they don't
       have the skewed state senate to deal with.

       The excuse is all the neoliberal Democrats who can't conceive of
       real progress in economic justice because they agree with the
       Republicans that it would make the economy collapse.
       Republican or neoliberal Democrat, the only economic justice they

       I apologize for continuing a tangent, but since my bike was hit by

 There are two sets of inflation ([240]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [241]Roadbed Guy

   the first is the federal inflation numbers that keeps track of
   borrowing costs for TBTF and national banks leading to private.

   Those institutions have seen deflation and small "healthy" inflation.

   Then there is inflation below this, that sets a ratio of pay to goods
   purchased.

   This has been rising.  Why?  Not because goods are going up, but
   because over all pay is going down. (pay is deflating, which makes it
   appear goods are inflating).

   95% of all life forms that once existed on earth are now extinct. It is
   only a matter of time until the Republicans follow suit.

       purchases that I make (a cup of coffee from 7.11, gasoline,  and

       For example, the $1.29 24 ounce cup of coffee from 7.11 from 3 or 4
       years ago now costs $1.85.
       And the $5 footlong sub is now $6.50 at the cheapest.
       And the price of gasoline doesn't really need to be dwelt upon, I
       don't think.
       So to me, inflation is quite rampant.

 Food inflation is happening ([249]0+ / 0-)
       but, it is controllable.  for instance, used to order that $10
       pizza that is now $13?  Cook with fresh vegetables instead, or make
       your own.  You'd save money and spend less.
       So yes, food is going up in price, but it can be managed and you
       can survive.  Will it get to the point that you can not?  Probably
       in the future if wages do not increase.  But for right now, it is
       managable, and you can in fact, spend less money than you did 5
       years ago.
       Brew your own coffee to save money.
       Take public transit to save gass

     Hard numbers: The economy is worse than you know
     Ever since the 1960s, Washington has gulled its citizens and
     creditors by debasing official statistics, the vital instruments
     with which the vigor and muscle of the American economy are
     measured.

     The effect has been to create a false sense of economic achievement
     and rectitude, allowing us to maintain artificially low interest
     rates, massive government borrowing, and a dangerous reliance on
     mortgage and financial debt even as real economic growth has been
     slower than claimed.
     The corruption has tainted the very measures that most shape public
     perception of the economy:
     o The monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI), which serves as the chief
     bellwether of inflation;

 Some arguments for increased minimum... ([258]0+ / 0-)

   ...wage are valid.

   However, [259]this

     "If we started in 1960 and we said that as productivity goes up,
     that is as workers are producing more, then the minimum wage is
     going to go up the same. And if that were the case then the minimum
     wage today would be about $22 an hour,"

   is not one of them - unless one understands that the "if [...] we said"
   part is of course referring to something an analytical person would not
   say thereby making the rest of the argument not worth reading. It's
   kind of like saying "If the Earth were flat, we could get rid of
   expensive toxic waste dumps because we could just push the toxic waste
   off the edge of the Earth".

   Such arguments are simply non-starters and I'm surprised to see Senator
   Warren making arguments along this line.

   The minimum wage workers are not responsible for all, or in fact most,
   of this "productivity" gain. For example, in 1960 no retailer would
   have had computerized POS systems w/scanners. So, in 1960 each
   transaction a retail clerk made required more time and more skill -
   they had to enter each price on a cash register by hand and they had to
   make change. Now they scan barcodes and their "register" tells them how
   much change to give the customer (and, in a few stores, even dispense
   the loose change to the customer). As well, many transactions are now
   done via debit or credit card which takes less time than making change
   (as in a well organized checkstand, the checker can be bagging while
   the transaction is being approved). As a result, the clerk can process
   more transactions per hour. The minimum wage worker (or their
   predecessors) were NOT the driving force behind the development of
   transistors, computers, lasers, VLSI, scanners, software, efficient
   software development environments and the like that resulted in the
   productivity gain.

   Consider if a ditch digger in 1800 made (in inflation adjusted dollars)
   $3 an hour and could routinely dig out three cubic yards an hour of a
   certain type of material. Now, today, suppose that job is done by a Cat
   390D L Hydraulic Excavator digging out eight cubic yards of that
   material every 30 seconds (i.e., 960 cubic yards per hour - or 320
   times as much as the ditch digger). Since a single operator can now
   move 320 times as much per hour, should that operator now make $960 per
   hour? Of course not, even considering that the ditch digger is an
   unskilled job and the excavator operator is a skilled job. The increase
   in productivity did NOT come mostly from the operator working harder or
   smarter, it came mostly from technology and engineering and capital
   investment replacing 320 hideous unskilled ditch digging jobs with one
   skilled equipment operator job.

       when you make minimum wage, and 90% of the jobs available to you
       are minimum wage, what real incentive do you have to tow the
       company line?
       Besides, minimum wage jobs rarely check job references, they offer
       employment on the spot.  Get fired from McD's?  Go work at ANY
       OTHER fast food joint for the same pay and shitty hours.

   the only people who worked at mcdonalds were other teenagers and
   college kids.

   the managers were adults, obviously, and occasionally we had an older
   person worker who were retired and bored.

   Now though, if you go into any fastfood joint, more than half of the
   staff will be adults and middle aged folks.

   this is the changing dynamic we live in, with people trying to support
   their families on wages that were designed for "disposable incomes".

   If these are the only jobs available, then wages must be raised.

       the college kids tend to work in the sit-down restaurants.  So
       although they get a bit less than standard minimum wage (which

       you just need to rent another apartment, which includes first
       month, and a month's security deposit, and often the last month,
       too, since your credit sucks.  Then you have to set up utilities,
       with installation fees.
       Then you have two utility bills to pay (that's water, trash, heat,
       internet or phone, unless you have a big cell plan, which, on
       minimum wage, you don't), a second set of renter's insurance, a
       second set of groceries and household supplies (even if each apt
       uses less, it's less inefficient), and so on.
       If you could save up a few thousand bucks to do all that until you
       land a better job, sure.  But the thing about these jobs, which pay
       $15K a year, is that there aren't a few thousand bucks to spare.

 "If these are the only jobs available... ([418]0+ / 0-)

   ...then wages must be raised."

   ...resulting in even fewer jobs by increasing motivation for store
   owners to install kiosks and develop and urge use of smartphone apps
   for ordering and paying for your order instead of interacting with a
   front counter worker.

   (Actually, I wish they would do this anyway. I'd much rather order my
   food before I leave wherever I'm coming from or even from the parking
   lot without waiting in an "order taking" line and THEN waiting for the
   "food assembly" phase.)

   The ratio of jobs that are unskilled or low skill will steadily decline
   simply because they will continue to be replaced by technology based
   rather than mindless human labor solutions even if we don't increase
   the minimum wage. Increasing the minimum wage substantially will just
   increase the rate of decline resulting in the few lucky people who
   capture these jobs being happier, but those that now could not get a
   job being in an even more dire situation.

   Also, if we raise the minimum wage substantially (say to $22/hour or
   about $44K/year as a linked article up-thread hinted at), some people
   who would previously have increased their skills via education/training
   to get a better paying job will instead opt for the minimum wage jobs.
   These new entrants into the pool of minimum wage workers will, I
   suspect, be the most qualified and best workers (as they were the ones
   with motivation and intelligence to escape the minimum wage pool when
   the pay was bad) and will take many of the minimum wage jobs that they
   previously would not have applied for.

   Of course, obviously salaries up the entire range will increase
   dramatically if one institutes a minimum wage of such absurd
   proportions as $22/hour. Why would someone bother to spend the time,
   energy, and money to get training and certifications to work in a
   stressful IT job for slightly above what they could get in a minimum
   wage job? These rampant salary increases would, of course, increase
   inflation which would result in everyone with full time employment
   about where they were before the minimum wage increase -- but those
   that had their work hours cut or can't find a job (due to the increased
   rate of technology adoption replacing now more expensive minimum wage
   workers) will be in much worse shape.

       absolutely false.
       the majority of money spent in the economy is spent by those making
       the least.
       If you increase their pay, they spend more.
       This money makes up for cost of product raises.
       The business owner makes the same on ratio.
       What does happen though?  any DEBTS the business owes decrease per
       ratio.
       For example.  if I was making a profit of 3/1 and that profit was
       3k a month, and wages doubled, and prices doubled, i'd be bringing
       in 6k a month, but the ratio of profit would still be 3/1.  But now
       my debts which stay the same, are twice as easy to pay.
       This goes for any worker holding debt.
       Imagine if your pay doubled, but your mortgage stayed the same
       (while you paid twice as much for food, gas, etc).
       Your house would be the cheapest bill you have, your debt would
       decrease faster, and you would be debt free in half the time, even
       while paying twice as much for utilities and food.

       Over the past 12 months I have not bought anything except food, and
       gas, I have needed to pay my mortgage $2300 per month, but with
       zero income as I can't collect UI as I resigned, my sole source of
       income has been my 401k and life savings,
       My friend own a liquor store, he has 2 employees that he pay $10
       per hour, currently he doesn't offer them health insurance but he
       will soon need to.  He is open 14 hours per day, so he need to pay
       a minimum of $140 per day, plus his rankings, and his rent, and
       utilities, he stands to earn less then his employees, if the wage
       were to rise to $15+ per hour, he would go out of business, McD
       would be safe but John Doe would shut down.
       If folks like me with an MBA start asking low wage jobs to just
       stay employees what will happen to those without a degree, they
       would be shut out.

       fast food is the cheapest food.
       vegetables and soups are by far cheaper and healthier.
       As for people without jobs such as yourself living on 401ks, fixed
       incomes, etc, yes you would feel the brunt of the pain, if you hold
       no debts.
       but then again if you hold no debts you are already far ahead of
       the group that does hold debt, so it would balance out, would it
       not?
       As for your friend, as I said, and as many economists have said,
       the price of product would raise across the board to counteract the
       rise in wages.  So he would still be making the same profit ratio.

       you have no reason employing someone.  If business is slow you can

 Because it is not true that all work is done by ([598]0+ / 0-)

   the worker...in all industries.  The business owner takes the initial
   risk and puts up the capital to get the business started.  The owner
   often operates in the red for several years until the business is
   established and forgoes their own personal bills to put it all in the
   business....sometimes, at the this point, the workers might indeed even
   make more than the owner himself...it is actually common for this to
   occur.

   Once the business is established, the owner pays all the business
   taxes, fees, licensing, business insurance, advertisement, building
   upkeep, maintenance, security, IT costs, equipment cost (copiers, fax
   machines, water coolers, computers, machines, specialty equipment etc)
   supplies to run the office (paper, ink, pens, desks, chairs,
   refrigerators, post it notes, toilet paper, tissues etc)....you get the
   point.  The workers do not have to pay any of this....nor worry about
   where the money comes from if it is needed and that month runs short.
   If this occurs, it is up to the owner to secure a loan or sell personal
   property of whatever.

   Once the business is a success, I see no reason that a business owner
   would not make more than the workers...some who may be only entry level
   workers and who complete only one small part of the business model.
   They wouldn't have had a job in the first place, had it not been for
   the capital, drive and productivity of the business owner in the first
   place.

       business owner takes the initial risk, and if it fails, he fails.
       but if it succeeds, it is because of additional labor, and labor is
       required for it to grow.
       without the additional labor, the business owner remains small.

 True ([627]0+ / 0-)

     My bet is, not one in thirty engineers would pursue a career
     scrubbing grease out from under the fry-o-lator for a 10% pay bump.

   But if the grease trap cleaning job also included the average salary
   growth that the engineering job would, a lot more than one in thirty
   would - mostly because grease cleaning guys don't take their work home
   with them.

   Engineers would often rather play on their own time on stuff that
   intrigues them which is not necessarily what their employer needs
   doing. However, at least in software engineering, there's too often
   little time left over for that (that "eight hour a day" job often
   becomes 24 hours a day when a key customer's system is belly up and
   stinking and a 12 hour a day job for weeks or months if the schedule
   slips or the marketing guys insist that more functions are required in
   the release to make it viable).

   It's rare for the grease cleaning guy to get an emergency call on his
   mobile at 3AM that requires him to cancel/delay the vacation he was
   expecting to start the next day.

   What about laws requiring that all employees be paid at least in part
   on a profit or revenue-sharing basis (or both, with the latter
   guaranteeing some flow of additional income, and the latter making
   possible yet more)?

   Because no matter how high you make the minimum wage, the majority of
   profits, if any, still go to the owners, not the employees or even
   managers. Investment capital still makes much more than human capital,
   which is wrong, because on a day to day basis, it's the employees who
   generate those profits through their labor, not capital, which is the
   fruit of past (also exploited) labor.

   Is that socialism? Whatever, who cares, so long as workers get justly

       On super slow days (rare) They get minimum wage and i take a loss.
        I keep track of that loss.
       On great days, they can make up to $40 an hour.
       This incentive makes them better sales people as they are

       But I view them as equals.  without them I would need to work

       They are also two of my best customers, returning some of those
       wages to me (which are not counted as part of the days sales that
       return to them).  Similar to how Ford paid his workers.
       But if, imagine, mcdonalds, paid their workers equal profits,
       minimum wage at mcdonalds would be close to $50 an hour, turnover

 AP had this bizarre blurb today if I heard right. ([738]0+ / 0-)

   "McDonald's workers are bizarrely striking to downgrade their pay.
   While the workers protest for $15/hr, the average worker pay is $25."

 Just did research ([741]0+ / 0-)

   And saw an article where a McDs in Massachusetts is hiring new
   employees, and they are asking the prospective employee to have a
   college degree, what does this say for the HS kids of college kids,
   looking for work when you can't or are not qualified for a job at McDs

 A telling comment ([744]0+ / 0-)

     Maybe I could afford to have a girlfriend, take her out on a date
     ...

   No wonder why conservatives are against a minimum wage hike--- it might
   lead the poor to procreate!

   Conservatives need to realize that their Silent Moral Majority is
   neither silent, nor moral, nor a majority.
