[22]Abbreviated pundit round-up: The sequester, slapping babies and the 'N'
word, and guns

   [29]The Editorial Board of The New York Times states in Defense and the
   Sequester:

     After 9/11, the Pentagon was handed a virtual blank check and its
     base budget soared from $397 billion in 2001 to $557 billion in
     2013. Spending is expected to decline in real terms this year, but
     after that it will rise slightly, even if the sequester takes
     effect, experts say. By some calculations, President Obama will
     still spend more on defense than most postwar presidents. The
     Pentagon needs to focus on shaping the force for new threats. Now
     that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are ending, it also needs to
     make reforms and rein in spending.

   [30]Doyle McManus at the Los Angeles Times concludes in D.C. doubles
   down on the sequester that neither side wants it but each thinks it can
   benefit from it:

     In the end, there will be some kind of compromise, probably around
     March 27, when Congress has to pass a law to keep the government
     operating for the rest of the year. It will probably include
     spending cuts that approach what the sequester demands, but with
     more flexibility--and, if Democrats have their way, a longer delay
     before the cuts kick in.

   [31]Joshua Holland at Alternet writes 4 Bogus Right-Wing Theories About
   Poverty, and the Real Reason Americans Can't Make Ends Meet:

     Nearly four years after economists tell us the "recovery" began,
     almost half of all American households lack enough savings to stay
     above the poverty line for three months or more if they should find
     themselves out of work. Another third are living paycheck to
     paycheck, teetering on the brink with no savings at all.

     It would require a lengthy sociological treatise to fully explain
     why this isn't considered a huge national crisis. But one part of
     the equation is the existence of a long-standing and ideologically
     informed project by the right to portray the burden of living in or
     near poverty as a liberal delusion.

   More pundits can be found below the fold.

   [32]Leonard Pitts Jr. at the Miami Herald writes in A baby, the N word
   and a slap for Jonah Bennett:

     We are rightfully outraged that someone would call a baby by a
     racial slur and then strike him.

     But it is a matter of statistical fact that [the baby, Jonah
     Bennett], from the moment he was born, stood an excellent chance of
     being struck in other ways. Of being failed by his school. Of being
     steered into the criminal injustice system as if prison was his
     natural habitat. Of being denied housing. Of being denied
     healthcare. Of being denied loans. Of being denied work. Of being
     denied his very individuality. There is also an excellent chance --
     indeed, a virtual certainty -- most of us will respond to this with
     a collective shrug, assuming we see it at all; such things tend to
     become socio-cultural wallpaper when they are not happening to you.

     It's easier to get worked up about violence that is visceral and
     immediate, particularly when it is directed against a child. We will
     be a better country, though, when we are willing to expend some of
     that outrage upon the violence we commit against African-American
     children every day, systemic blows which are at once more subtle,
     more pervasive and more damaging.

   [33]Joel Bleifuss at In These Times writes in Before we can save the
   honeybees, we need to resuscitate the EPA that neonicotinoid
   pesticides--or "neonics"--are poisoning bees. One of the two most-sold
   of these pesticides is clothianidin:

     In 2003, Bayer asked EPA officials to allow clothianidin on the
     market--before tests on the pesticide's environmental impact had
     been completed. The EPA agreed. And thus began another chapter in
     the EPA's sad history of protecting not the environment, but
     corporate interests.

   [34]Jane Mayer at The New Yorker asks Is Senator Ted Cruz Our New
   McCarthy?

   [35]E.J. Dionne at the Washington Post writes The miracle on guns:

     A not-so-small miracle is unfolding before our eyes. After nearly
     two decades in which established opinion insisted that it would
     never again be possible to pass sensible regulations of firearms,
     the unthinkable is on the verge of happening.

   [36]James Ridgeway and Jean Casella at Mother Jones write at Big
   Labor's Lock 'Em Up Mentality--How otherwise progressive unions stand
   in the way of a more humane correctional system:

     [W]hether prisons are public or private, preserving jobs generally
     means locking away as many people as possible for as long as
     possible--contrary to the goal of reducing mass incarceration.
     California's prison guards union, for example, was one of the
     primary sponsors of the proposition that brought about Three Strikes
     in the 1990s. In the aughts, the union opposed parole reform and
     vigorously campaigned to defeat politicians it regarded as soft on
     crime. It has also supported the death penalty, despite the
     staggering cost to state taxpayers.

   [37]Dave Zirin, at The Progressive notes in Florida Atlantic's Folly:
   Why GEO Group Should Not Have Naming Rights that Florida Atlantic
   University had sold the naming rights to its football field GEO Group
   Stadium:

     Governments across the world, from South Africa to the United
     Kingdom to Australia, pay the GEO Group to take over their jails and
     run them as privatized, for-profit enterprises.

     In the United States, where the prison population has more than
     doubled since 1992 and is now the highest in the world, this is
     known as a growth industry. In many communities, where people of
     color are victimized by callously punitive laws (promoted by the
     lobbying arms of for-profit prisons), it's known as the New Jim
     Crow. The GEO group is the second largest for-profit prison company
     in the United States, behind only the Correctional Corporation of
     America.

   [38]Peggy Noonan, by relentlessly hammering the same point, is just
   like Paul Krugman--except that she is a dunce, as she proves once again
   at The Wall Street Journal (free link) in Government by Freakout:

     Mr. Obama thrives in chaos. He flourishes in unsettled circumstances
     and grooves on his own calm. He spins an air of calamity, points
     fingers and garners support. His only opponent is a hapless,
     hydra-headed House.

   [39]Jill Filipovic at The Guardian writes :

     It's hardly breaking news that junk food is bad for us. But just how
     bad - and just how much food companies know about the addictive
     components of certain foods, and just how much they deliberately
     target the most vulnerable consumers knowing they are doing damage -
     is still being discovered. [...]

     Nearly everything written about food in the mainstream media relies
     on the same narrative: Obesity is bad. That kind of reporting is
     part of what's keeping us sick.

   [40]S.E. Cupp at the New York Daily News says in that she got blasted
   by the "dittoheads" for criticizing Rush Limbaugh as being harmful to
   the Republican Party:

     Some demanded I apologize. Others implied I just committed career
     suicide. Others still politely suggested I commit actual suicide.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       ...don't have the interests of poor and middle-class people at
       heart except in the most relative terms--compared to a bunch of
       sociopaths.  The sequester is more progressive than whatever
       last-minute bullshit compromise they will come up with.  Not for
       the first time, I'm hoping that Republican nihilism wins out over

       Actually being able to take a major chunk out of defense spending
       is a good thing. The problem is taking a meat cleaver to federal
       spending right now is going to slow the whole economy down.
       Softening the blow of the spending cuts by decreasing them and
       increasing revenue else where is a better way. It just doesnt look
       like that is going to happen.

                Exit, [112]Amber6541, [113]zinger99, [114]codairem

       State of the Union speech, Jeffrey Sachs wrote on the HuffPo blog
       an entry titled [115]The Vision of the BudgetThe article compared
       Obama's vision for the future of the country as expressed in the
       speech and the reality of the budget he was proposing.

     By now, the non-defense discretionary budget of Obama is less than
     under Bush, measured relative to the size of the economy. It now
     stands at around 3.4 percent of GDP. (The stimulus package pushed it
     up temporarily, but then outlays on this budget category came right
     down again when the temporary stimulus expired). All of the great
     things that President Obama rightly would like to do are without
     budget funding. And that's because the Democrats have bought into
     the Republican tax model in order to win elections.

     Now here's the rub. President Obama seems intent now on a fiscal
     deal within the next few weeks that will make all of this permanent.
     All of the great vision and dreams will come to nothing if there is
     no budget to support them. And yet what is the White House
     championing?
     I kid you not: the White House is touting a budget based on a
     baseline in which the non-defense discretionary budget will fall
     sharply in the coming years, to just 2.4 percent of GDP by 2022.
     That would be the lowest level in decades. It would make impossible
     the realization of the vision in yesterday's great speech.
     And the truth is even worse. The 2.4 percent that would be left for
     all of the uplifting investments in his inaugural address also
     includes national security spending such as homeland security. If
     you strip out the national security spending from the 2.4 percent of
     GDP, we'd have just 1.7 percent of GDP available for all federal
     discretionary programs not related to national security and defense.
     We need more revenues. Period.
       I used to try to reason with people who claimed Obama was a liberal
       socialist who just kept thinking up ways to spend more money.  Now
       I just point and jeer at those people.  But I'm crying on the
       inside for the country described in the soaring rhetoric of Obama's
       speeches and the reality of what he's actually doing.
       "In this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be
       thankful for; as for me, I rejoice that I am not a Republican." -

   While I'm not sure much more than background checks and some lip

   If there was any doubt that the right in this country has never gotten
   over the 4 decade masturbation session of the cold war, Ted Cruz has
   proved it once and for all.  Is this what our national politics have
   been reduced to? Allen West and Ted Cruz claiming to have lists of
   communist infiltrators? It's like a that episode of the Twilight Zone
   "He's Alive" about the spirit of Hitler living on, except this time
   it's Joe McCarthy. Rod Serling's closing monologue pretty much sums up
   our politics right now.

     Where will he go next, this phantom from another time, this
     resurrected ghost of a previous nightmare - Chicago? Los Angeles?
     Miami? Florida; Vincennes, Indiana; Syracuse, New York? Anyplace,
     everyplace, where there's hate, where there's prejudice, where
     there's bigotry. He's alive. He's alive so long as these evils
     exist. Remember that when he comes to your town. Remember it when
     you hear his voice speaking out through others. Remember it when you
     hear a name called, a minority attacked, any blind, unreasoning
     assault on a people or any human being. He's alive because through
     these things we keep him alive

   About

     On December 14, 2012 our town was traumatized by one of the worst
     mass murders in American history. In the wake of the tragedy at
     Sandy Hook Elementary School, over 100 doctors from Newtown, CT have
     united as a professional voice for our grieving town. Although our
     specialties differ, our goal is the same--to stop this national
     epidemic that has taken our children. We believe this is a major
     public health issue and can be successfully addressed as with other
     previous United States epidemics including tobacco, alcohol and
     motor vehicle safety

       The public health approach seems like a promising one to me.  In my
       lifetime I've seen it work with smoking and also driving while
       impaired (alcohol or other drugs).
       There has definitely been a swing towards an obsession with guns in
       the past couple of decades.  Part of a calculated PR campaign IMHO.
        In which case, putting that into reverse ought to work, given
       time, effort and money.

       The ad is good, but the best part is the target and the timing.  By
       getting out early and defining the terms of the campaign in ways
       that turn one of his perceived positives into a negative, it puts
       down a foundation on which a Democratic nominee can build.  It

   poll, commented on in National Sentinel (article mostly on another
   anti-voter inititative (Republicans don't seem to like all amendments-
   esp. 17th):
   ===============
   ...the timing of the move is interesting. Coincidentally, on the same
   day that the Sentinel reported on the Republicans' repeal plans, Public
   Policy Polling released a new poll showing that the GOP is in real
   danger of losing another Senate seat in 2014.

   Despite the fact that Democrats have not won a major election in
   Georgia in 13 years, PPP finds that the race for the seat currently
   held by retiring Republican Saxby Chambliss is a complete toss-up.
   Democratic congressman John Barrow trails five likely Republican
   candidates -- U.S. Representatives Paul Broun, Phil Gingrey, Tom Price,
   and Jack Kingston, and right-wing activist Karen Handel -- by an
   average of just 0.4 percent.

   If former senator Max Cleland (D) jumped into the race, he'd start out
   with a lead over all five Republicans.

   Republicans should be deeply troubled by their weak numbers in Georgia,
   ostensibly a deep-red state. If they lose Chambliss' seat, it would all
   but end their hopes of capturing a Senate majority in 2014. The six
   Georgia lawmakers' solution to the problem appears to be taking the
   decision out of voters' hands, which fits a broad pattern of Republican
   behavior since the 2012 election. Once again, the party's prevailing
   strategy appears to be "If you can't beat them, change the rules."

   There are many more generals than needed, each with his/her own staff

   The Old Truck is turning 18 and has 245000+ miles on it and, honestly,
   has seen better days. It's continued reliablity is legitiamately in

   So that means time to buy another vehicle so I can continue to arrive
   at work and earn my paycheck which lets me buy a car to get to work and
   a home where I can stay in between times I am at work.

   Terrified of buying another car because of the economy: I remain
   shell-shocked by the number of times I have been laid off in the past
   12 years.

   Oh, yeah - and we JUST got our cards for our new BC/BS insurance that
   we are paying for entirely out of our pockets. $450 a month with a
   $7000 deductible for the two of us combined. Like buying a BMW or
   worse. But we are now actually covered and if one of us does lose a

       I expect the same will happen to our governor next year, when he
       realizes all the tax cuts he passed in 2011 are going to bankrupt
       the state if he doesn't do something.
       People are already pissed at him for trying to eliminate very
       popular deductions to raise revenues, and for backing off the
       "temporary" sales tax hike (decided that he likes that extra

   The phrase is used by the right along with "union boss" and "union

   institutions that give ordinary working people any voice in their
   work/economic lives.

   There is no "big" labor any more. With less than 7% of the private
   sector organized and the public sector under vicious attack from the
   Walkers, Snyders, Brownbacks, Kasichs, etc....the Labor Movement is on
   life support.

   Unions aren't perfect. No institutions are. They make tactical mistakes
   and are sometimes wrong on policy. The "uniforms" tend to be more
   conservative than most unions. But they have a right to their own
   voice. By all means, Mother Jones, disagree with them, but leave the
   right's terminology to the union busters.
