   The shooting in Newtown got a lot of pro-gun activists like the NRA
   talking about preventing gun deaths by empowering civilians to carry
   weapons in public places such as schools.

   But in Oakland, California, where community members have been watching
   the gun violence epidemic claiming lives for many long years, a group
   of local activists has banded together for a different kind of
   empowerment. Instead of meeting guns with more guns, the [38]People's
   Community Medics are training citizens in basic first aid techniques to
   treat gunshot wound victims. Their effort were recently documented in
   the [39]East Bay Express.

   Sharena Thomas and Lesley Phillips founded the group in 2012. Both have
   CPR and other basic medical training. In a post on the blog
   [40]Northbay Uprising, they wrote about how their project was catalyzed
   after an unarmed man named Oscar Grant was shot in the back by a BART
   officer and died in 2009, a case that prompted widespread protests and
   riots after the officer in question was [41]convicted of involuntary
   manslaughter but acquitted of murder:

     While members of the Oscar Grant Committee we learned that the BART
     police refused to call an ambulance for 20 minutes for fatally
     wounded Oscar Grant, despite the passionate pleas for medical help
     from his friends who were detained at the Fruitvale station by the
     police. That experience as well as our knowledge that 911 calls
     often do not result in an ambulance arriving in a timely manner to
     Black neighborhoods largely inspired us to teach our people basic
     emergency first aid so that we can help one another until an
     ambulance arrives.

   The group's efforts come in a context of rising violent crime and
   falling police staffing in Oakland. According to an article in the
   [42]Wall Street Journal, budget cuts have cut the number of officers
   from 820 four years ago to just 630 today. At the same time, homicides
   have been on the rise - 126 in 2012, compared to 103 in 2011. Other
   violent crimes, including rape and assault, have also been climbing
   steeply. To respond, the department [43]just hired William Bratton,
   former police chief of New York City, as a consultant - a move that
   drew protest from some Oakland residents who are concerned about
   Bratton's history of using controversial "stop and frisk" tactics.

   The relationship between Oakland police and people in minority
   neighborhoods is badly strained. In December 2012, after a [44]decade
   of struggling to comply with a consent decree instituted in response to
   a case in which four officers were convicted of planting evidence and
   using excessive force, the city [45]handed over control of the
   department to a court-appointed official.

   As crime has continued to rise, residents frequently complain that
   [46]police response to 911 calls can be slow. The [47]East Bay
   Express piece details just how bad the problem is, using the
   department's own figures:

     According to data obtained from the Oakland Police Department, there
     were 36,236 high-priority 911 calls made in 2012 -- most of which
     were for violent crimes. But it took the understaffed police
     department between ten and thirty minutes to arrive at 36 percent of
     those calls. In 13 percent of the cases, OPD showed up more than
     thirty minutes after the initial call for service.

   According to a training video [48]posted on YouTube, People's Community
   Medics has adopted Public Enemy's 1990 classic "911 Is a Joke" as its
   theme song.

   When the cops do show up, they sometimes prioritize securing and
   investigating the crime scene over giving medical attention to the
   wounded. And paramedics, who in Oakland often reach the site of a
   violent crime before the police, [49]have for several years now been
   following a policy increasingly common in the United States -- one that
   requires them to wait several blocks from a shooting scene until they
   are given the go-ahead to come in and administer medical assistance to
   the victims, even if people are critically wounded.

   That approach was instituted to protect paramedics, but it has caused a
   lot of anger in the city, particularly in minority neighborhoods.

   Thomas and Phillips emphasize that they don't see paramedics as the
   problem. "We have a good relationship with them," said Thomas [50]in a
   segment that aired on Yahoo! News. "All we're doing is adding a cushion
   between the time they get there, that's all. We're assisting them to
   add life to our people."

   At a People's Community Medics training in an Oakland park last
   September, a young woman stepped forward to speak about an incident
   that had occurred there four days earlier and just a couple of hundred
   yards away. Her account, which is on the above video (starting just
   before the 6-minute mark), gives some idea of the extreme situations
   people in Oakland's toughest neighborhoods are dealing with every day.

   She was hanging out in the park when she heard rapid, repeated
   gunshots, she said, and she was sure that someone must have been hit.
   So while others were running away, she ran across the grass and the
   parking lot toward the victim, who had been shot four times, in the
   head, leg, and torso.

   She stuck her thumb in one of the wounds, and applied pressure to two
   of the others by lying on top of him. The fourth wound, she couldn't
   reach. She estimated that it was 25-30 minutes before official help
   arrived. In the meantime, she lay in that awkward position, stopping
   the bleeding as best she could. Some other bystanders suggested putting
   the man on a mattress and driving him to the hospital in a pickup
   truck, but she argued that could shift the bullets and make his
   condition even worse. In the end she prevailed, and the man survived.

   "If I wouldn't have did the things that I did, he could have laid there
   and died," she said. "I just thank God for giving me the opportunity,
   that experience, to know what to do, because most people, when those
   shots were going off they were just leaving, just running.... My
   instinct was not to leave him, was to help him. When something like
   that happens, we got to come together as a community."

   officers who were killed while on duty in Oakland, California, March
   24, 2009. An Oakland, California man killed four police officers
   Saturday in two separate shootings that began with a traffic stop and
   ended with a gun battle, police said. (Kimberly White/Reuters)
