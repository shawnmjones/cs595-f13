[24]Moron Rep. Gary Miller was apparently an immigrant too. From Arkansas

   Cardboard box
   No, you don't understand immigrants because you moved that one time.
   [30]Idiot.

     California Republican Rep. Gary Miller has earned a reputation as an
     immigration hardliner, but when confronted by a group of young
     immigrants Friday at a public event in Rancho Cucamonga (which had a
     $12 entry fee), Miller told them he understands their plight because
     he, too, is an immigrant, of sorts, moving with his family from
     Arkansas to California as a young child.

   Can Miller be deported back to Arkansas?

   Does California bar benefits for people from Arkansas?

   Is he forbidden from visiting Arkansas, lest he not be allowed back
   into California?

   Does he get pulled over and asked for papers for looking like he's from
   Arkansas?

   Is he or his children blocked from going to college or joining the
   military because his parents were from Arkansas?

   Does California have an entire political party dedicated to making life
   miserable for people from Arkansas?

   Is his ability to emerge from the shadows in California dependent on
   whether assholess like Rep. Gary Miller decide to be a little less
   assholish for at least one vote?

   No? Then he should shut the fuck up. Even I, having lived a bona fide
   immigrant experience, have no clue what it must be like for our
   undocumented. But Miller moved once, so he totally feels them even
   though he votes consistently against them? Jackass.

   On the plus side, Miller is a political fluke, the beneficiary of
   California's new (and ridiculous) jungle primary in which all
   candidates, from all parties, run together in a primary, with the top
   two going into the general. Too many Democrats split the vote in this
   17-point Obama district, and Miller squeaked through. He's the lowest
   of low-hanging fruit for Democrats. He won't be around much longer.

   Lucky for him, he can always go back to his motherland, Arkansas.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [48]Tagging tips - [49]Search For Tags - [50]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   his past websites eschewing hate against immigrants.  Now that he is in
   a district with mnay Latinos, he is trying to pretend to be something
   different from what he always has been, but he simply is not good at
   changing spots.   Latinos know what he is and will vote accordingly.

       [367]White House scolded at Inland Empire summit with Latinos

     San Bernardino, a city where Latinos account for 6 of every 10
     residents, has the second-highest poverty rate among the nation's
     major cities. A U.S. Census report released in September showed that
     34.7% of city residents live below the poverty line.

     UC Riverside political science professor Armando Navarro, a vocal
     immigrant rights activist, didn't let the president off so easy.
     Navarro said Obama made a serious miscalculation pushing his
     healthcare legislation through Congress early in his term, depleting
     precious political capital that would have been better used for
     initiatives to create jobs and save homes from foreclosure.
       Perhaps we can join forces with the Latinos in his district.

       [388]Redlands mayor Pete Aguilar is the main Democrat running.  He
       ran in 2012 but failed to make it to the runoff because of split
       Dem votes (a GOP state senator managed to make spot #2 behind Gary
       Miller).  This is because California changed how they do elections,
       no longer having primaries by party, but rather everyone on the
       same ballot on primary day, and the top two advance to a runoff
       regardless of party (similar to Louisiana).  This time Miller
       should be the only prominent Republican, so Aguilar (or another
       Democrat) should be assured of making it to the runoff, and almost
       certainly beating Miller in November 2014.
       Also running are former Congressman (and conservaDem) [389]Joe
       Baca, and attorney [390]Eloise Reyes.

   And who's brilliant idea was it to have free-for-all primaries, anyway?
   Does it make any sense? A primary is a way for the party to choose it's
   candidate for the general, it's not for independents or opposition
   party members to decide.
   If they want to run this kind of, as you say,"Jungle Primary", it
   should be IRV so that it becomes the general election, de facto and
   saves the state the cost of a two-stage election.
   California used to be smart. Something died when Prop 13 went in and
   even with Gerry Brown back in the saddle, it hasn't recovered yet.

       was extending Prop 13 protections to corporations. If that hadn't
       been part of it, sooner or later it would have been self-correcting
       as the seniors died out and the family home left the family and
       went back on the open market, subject to re-assessment and taxation
       at the going rate. Prop 13 enabled both my mother and my in-laws to
       remain in their homes well into their senior years. It's the
       corporate property tax that's been the killer -- and I believe may
       have been the ultimate goal of Jarvis and Gann, but they tossed in
       the homeowner protections solely to use the "seniors being tossed

 Does it make any sense? ([438]0+ / 0-)

   The "Jungle Primary" makes sense if the goal is political parties that
   wish to appeal to broad masses of voters instead of to an increasingly
   narrow base.  I would argue that it also promotes organization over
   advertising.  If a candidate can pull enough people in behind her or
   him, then there's a spot open in the general election.  It behooves a
   party's would-be "King makers" to back one candidate early in the
   process, settling whatever differences they may have amongst
   themselves, in preference to each one backing their own candidate --
   only to see them all go down to defeat.  As happened in this district.
    But, it's a learning process.  And while we're all waiting to see if
   Miller gets shown the door in the next round, go back and study up on
   what [439]George Washington Plunkitt said about how to go about
   becoming a politician....

   "There is no way to give to honest toil its just reward--its full share
   of all wealth produced--but by the full application of the single tax.
   And righteousness and justice require it to be done." --A. Moll, 1897

   Sadly no.  Must work on that.

   Does California bar benefits for people from Arkansas?

   Again no, but to be fair California does a better than average job of
   getting benefits to all.

   Is he forbidden from visiting Arkansas, lest he not be allowed back
   into California?

   No but this should be reasonably easy to implement by blocking all
   flights from Arkansasstan.

   Does he get pulled over and asked for papers for looking
   like he's from Arkansas?

   No but also easy to implement.  We could do it by tooth count - say
   below 15 - or by looking for "Sooooooweeeeeeee Pig" t-shirts.

   Is he or his children blocked from going to college or joining the
   military because his parents were from Arkansas?

   Lets be honest, do we really need to BLOCK Arkansans from going to
   college?  Arnt they self selecting out?

   Does California have an entire political party dedicated to making life
   miserable for people from Arkansas?

   No but I will form one NOW!

     Do Re Mi
     Words and Music by Woody Guthrie

     Lots of folks back East, they say, is leavin' home every day,
     Beatin' the hot old dusty way to the California line.
     'Cross the desert sands they roll, gettin' out of that old dust
     bowl,
     They think they're goin' to a sugar bowl, but here's what they find
     Now, the police at the port of entry say,
     "You're number fourteen thousand for today."
     Oh, if you ain't got the do re mi, folks, you ain't got the do re
     mi,
     Why, you better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas,
     Georgia, Tennessee.
     California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see;
     But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
     If you ain't got the do re mi.
     You want to buy you a home or a farm, that can't deal nobody harm,
     Or take your vacation by the mountains or sea.
     Don't swap your old cow for a car, you better stay right where you
     are,
     Better take this little tip from me.
     'Cause I look through the want ads every day
     But the headlines on the papers always say:
     If you ain't got the do re mi, boys, you ain't got the do re mi,
     Why, you better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas,

     California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see;

   was designed by the California Republicans for just such a scenario,
   typical Republicans can't win in a fair fight so they have to change
   the rules. As it turns out though the open primary law handed the State
   Congress over to a Democratic supermajority. And the outlook for the
   state has never been brighter.

 Pelosi was the primary target of that, IIRC ([657]1+ / 0-)

                [658]Gentle Giant

       The only way Pelosi can realistically lose re-election is to
       another Democrat, so the Republicans pushed for (and got) an open
       primary in an attempt to get Pelosi out of office via another
       Democrat defeating her in a general election.
       That didn't work for them, at least in 2012: she drew a Republican
       opponent in the general election, which she overwhelmingly
       defeated.

   There's a book out there, "One of Our 50 Is Missing."  It's a
   compilation of various experiences people from New Mexico have with
   other people of the United States who don't quite seem to realize that
   yes, New Mexico is part of the United States.

   From the student starting at Harvard who had his financial aid
   application rejected because he was a "foreign student" and thus only
   eligible for their aid to foreign students to the time Senator Pete
   Domenici was asked to leave the floor of the Senate because a vote was
   about to take place and "foreign dignitaries" were not allowed on the
   floor, New Mexicans have often had to handle the shock of the rest of
   the country as they realize that Arizona doesn't border Texas.

   I've had people comment upon how good my English is and how you could
   hardly detect my accent.

   When the state updated the license plate back in the 90s, it was
   updated a second time soon after.  It used to say simply, "New Mexico,"
   on the bottom.  The second revision was to have it say, "New Mexico,
   USA."  People kept getting pulled over by cops who thought we were
   illegals.
