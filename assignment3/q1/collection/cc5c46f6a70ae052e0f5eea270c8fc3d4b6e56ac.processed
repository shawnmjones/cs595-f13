[22]Open thread for night owls: Everyday violence gets ignored

   Steven Rosenfeld writes [29]America's Focus on Terrorism Blinds Us To
   Everyday Violence and Suffering:

   The Boston Marathon bombing and shootouts with the suspects frightened
    millions of Americans and turned into one of the biggest media events
     of the 21st century. But beyond lingering questions of whether the
     government went too far by shutting down an entire city and whether
     that might encourage future terrorism, a deeper and darker question
         remains: why is America's obsession with evil so selective?

   There are all kinds of violent events in America that go unheeded. The
    British-based Guardian newspaper reported that on the same day as the
    bombing, 11 people were killed by guns across the U.S. That sad list
   included a pregnant woman in Dallas allegedly shot by her boyfriend; a
   13-year-old who took his own life after being bullied at school; and an
   off-duty New York City policewoman who killed her husband, her year-old
      baby, and then committed suicide with her police-issued handgun.

   The lists of most violent American trends reveal the mundane shades of
   evil. There are the most violent cities. There are the murder capitals.
    There's domestic violence primarily against women. There are the most
    dangerous jobs, where injury is common and death far more widespread
     than from bomb-wielding terrorists--such as at the Texas fertilizer
    plant that blew up last week and killed at least 14 people and where
   270 tons of ammonium nitrate was illegally stored in violation of state
                              and federal law.

     What is it about the nature of one form of evil versus another that
   grips America's attention, whipping mainstream media into a frenzy and
      pushing government to pull out the stops in one moment but not in
        another? Do we respond more to the unexpected rather than to
               senselessness that continues day by day? [...]

    Humanity certainly has dark sides that are expressed in violent rage.
      But there's also something very wrong and dark about disregarding
    everyday violence, just because it's the rule and not the exception.
            _____________________________________________________

   [30]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2008--He's with
   us on everything but ... everything:

    Here's my rule -- and you can take it or leave it -- on referring to
     "the bloggers." You must keep in mind that blogs are communications
    tools, and that the people who use them aren't some new species from
     outer space. People who use blogs to communicate about politics are
    saying exactly the same things that they used to say, and that other
   people still say, to each other over the telephone, at the office water
       cooler, and over long lunches. This is just the first time that
          politicians and media types have ever had access to those
   conversations, because the tool we use puts them out there for them to
   see. (Yes, we are granting the media access to the minds of the voters.
     Where's the gratitude and groveling that politicians get when they
                               grant access?)

   So the bottom line is this: bloggers are just people who leave "paper"
      trails of their thoughts. If you have something to say about "the
      bloggers," try this simple exercise first to see if you might be
    talking out your ass: Substitute the word "telephone" for "blog." If
   your sentence still makes sense, you're onto something. If not, you're
                                talking shit.

                "The telephoners want us to get rid of him."

    Well, that sounds a little dumb, really. But in this particular case,
      Senator [DEL: Schumer :DEL] Anonymous is probably onto something.
      Democrats who own or use telephones really do want to get rid of
                      Lieberman, and in large numbers.

   On today's [36]Kagro in the Morning show, seems the meme is spreading
   that there were some magical things the President could have done to
   erase entrenched obstructionism & pass the gun bill. Greg Dworkin
   joined us on that subject at the top of the show, and Armando comes
   thundering in on it at the end. In between, we run down the day's
   headlines from The Hill,: filibuster reform, sequestration & the
   complicated politics surrounding both. Turns out the catalyst for
   sequester frustration finally breaking through is ... airport delays.
   And, Congress reverts to form with the emergence of a new kind of
   earmark: sequester exemptions.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [49]Tagging tips - [50]Search For Tags - [51]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       We've added [96]a whopping 1,965 more users in the last 24 hours.
       This is a continuation going back to May where we've been
       absolutely flooded with new users.  I'm pretty sure almost all of
       these new users are spammers or bots.  While the rate had been
       getting faster, it seems they suddenly started slowing down right
       when Hurricane Sandy hit.  It slowed down to under 1,000 new users
       in a 24-hour period, and we were back down to somewhat over 100 new
       users every 24 hours or so, until about January 30th, when it
       exploded again.  What are they [97]planning?

   ...Cal Thomas--remember him? I was his syndicate editor or the editor
   of his editor for five years--personally and telephonically harangued
   hundreds of newspaper opinion editors about their supposed lack of
   conservative columnists--as if William F. Buckley Jr., George Will, Pat
   Buchanan, all of whom appeared in more than a thousand newspapers at
   the time, were liberals. And lots of those editors went for the
   intimidation and stuck Cal on their pages twice a week, and he
   eventually became No. 1. What did he do? A little self-interested
   community organizing. Everywhere he spoke professionally, which was
   often, he urged everyone who showed up to hear him to call or write
   their local editor and demand that the paper run Cal's column. If only
   25 did so, that could be enough to push an editor to do it.

   He had taken a right-wing myth and theme and transformed it into a
   marketing tool that eventually made him the leading political columnist
   in the country measured by the number of newspapers that decided to buy
   his words.

   Not that it was ever true that the majority of newspaper op-ed's were
   liberal. And those that did lean liberal kept it to a curtailed
   liberalness, with, for example, pro-union pundits being as rare as
   democratic socialists on those pages. Such views are still seen as
   improper today by almost all the so-called liberal media. So the only
   socialist anybody knows is Bernie Sanders. What do you suppose is the
   latest count on namable right-wing columnists?

       Social Democrats are a political party in Germany, or were, I

       Democratic Socialist may very well be ideologically different than
       Social Democrat.
       Admittedly, I'm unclear on that. Interesting, though. I'll be

   Wonder what he calls Harry Reid's failure to use the nuclear option? If
   we're going to get anything accomplished, we're going to have to call
   everybody out.
   In a large sense, this has become a republic where representatives of
   both parties, overwhelmingly the Republicans, are dead sure that we
   elected them to not pay any attention to us. As I said before in
   Government and Polls: "Is this thing on?" They don't seem to be able
   to, or want to, hear what the hell we're saying.
   What to do about it? They are already in, and that may have been be our
   self inflicted wound. We believed in them.
   Again.
   Shall we continue to send petitions that seem to have no effect? Shall
   we continue to threaten them with 2014? Perhaps, that. But in a
   devestating way.
   The only idea I can come up with is the most massive grassroots
   mobilization in history. This time, however, each candidate should be
   vetted to within an inch of his/her life. And it should be demonstrably
   proven during the primaries that we mean exactly what we say.

   My guess is that there is something in us that must believe that there

   overlook the everyday evils.

   I don't offer this by way of excuse. I offer it as a reason to keep

   There's also the cynical answer that bombs and blood attract eyeballs

     Evil. Her thesis is that the great evils in history generally, and
     the Holocaust in particular, were not executed by fanatics or
     sociopaths, but by ordinary people who accepted the premises of
     their state and therefore participated with the view that their
     actions were normal.

       soldiers and cops who performed the initial round-ups, all of that

       But the actual camps themselves were run by a group of individuals
       selected specifically for their psychopathic and sadistic
       tendencies.
       It was discovered that when it came to the killing, ordinary men
       would break down, become hopeless drunks, or kill themselves.  The
       Soviet secret police also discovered this during Stalin's purges.

   How we can manage to completely ignore the will of the people in
   regards to background checks as countless people keep getting
   killed/injured by guns, deploy an army to catch a 19 year old kid and
   cede our civil rights out of fear, ignore our crumbling society here at
   home while nation-building elsewhere, and pollute the earth while
   denying we're causing any changes because of it.

   Will we ever learn?

 Two items for you ([765]0+ / 0-)

   I was gone for a while but now I'm back. Computer trouble.
   Now on to the items.

     Today I was on the bus and sitting next to me was a young lady and on
   her lap she had a book titled London. It was a traveling book.
       "Are you going to London?" I asked.
       "Yes." She replied.
       "Have you ever been there before?"
       "No."
       "Well." I said. "Blah, blah, blah...Tate Gallery, Blah, blah, blah,
   Covent Gardens."
        She said that she was 24 and was going to be there for a month and
   a half, but didn't seem to know much about it."
         I said, "And don't miss Windsor Castle."
         "Oh, I love castles." She said.
         See what I mean.
         "If you can get out of London take a trip up to Liverpool." I
   said.
         "What's that?" She asked, and I'm not kidding.
         "Liverpool, where the Beatles were from. You can take a Beatles
   tour."
         "I don't know much about London or England." She said.
         I let it roll off my back until I said, "And you can't leave
   London without going to Herrods to go shopping."
         "What's that, where is it?"
         I smiled and asked, "How did you decide to go to London, close
   your eyes and stick a pin on a map?" But in a nice way.
         I wished her well and have a great trip as I got off the bus, but
   honestly, my son at age 10 knew more about England.

    In an unrelated story:

         It All Started on a Snow Day.

         A very special, fateful snow day in upstate New York. At the
   residence of the Abbey's...

         Spencer Abbey was an air traffic controller, but he was at work,
   stuck there because of all the snow. This kind of thing happens often
   so no big deal. Anyway he doesn't really enter into the story much
   except he named their eldest son.
         They lived in a nice, quiet, bucolic, suburban neighborhood. With
   nice, quiet, bucolic, suburban people. Spencer promised his wife one
   day he would show her the world.
         Cherry Blossom was his wife. She was not Japanese, or Chinese nor
   did she come from Washington D.C. Her parents were hippies, so she was
   a librarian. She went by the name of Cherry. But isn't that cool, her
   name was Cherry Blossom Abbey. They had an Irish Setter named Goldie,
   after Goldilocks because it took her forever to get comfortable
   anywhere when she was a puppy. She was four then.
           Their oldest son was named Richard after Keith Richards. His
   friends called him Keef or Abbey Road depending on how loud it was in
   the room. Keef sort of gets lost in the shuffle of a loud party but not
   Abbey Road. He was 16 and a good kid, he got good grades but liked to
   see how much trouble he could get into without getting caught. He was
   the outdoors guy. He was a surfer stuck in up state New York but he
   well made up for it by improvising.
          He had a girlfriend named Cindy and they did everything but
   that. Cindy played the drums and Richard thought that was cool. Cindy
   called Richard Ricky and so did his mom.
          Next comes Allen age 10, named after Edgar Allen Poe, Cherry
   Blossom's favorite author.
   He was also a good kid and curious about everything, especially how
   things work. He shared Cherry Blossom's sense of fun and love of all
   things Halloween.
          Both kids seemed to possess a higher than average I.Q. Richard
   preferred Risk over D&D.
   Allen liked Pictionary.
          After breakfast Cherry Blossom decided to take advantage of a
   day at home and take care of some overdue laundry.
          She went to collect the cloths then stopped in at the kitchen to
   announce things before she headed down to the basement.
          "Ricky I want you to stop over at Miss Robbie's to see if she's
   O.K. Ask her if she needs anything, and offer to shovel her walk. Then
   shovel ours. See if your friend can come over with the thing to do the
   drive way, I'll pay him. Allen, go outside for a while and get cold,
   build a snowman, or get your friends together to build a fort. Or have
   a snowball war, or something. When you come in I'll make cocoa, we're
   going to have homemade soup tonight."
           RING, RING, RINGY, RING...
           "That's your father, go, get."
           Miss Robbie was a 75 year old neighbor of theirs that always
   brought over cookies and watched the dog when they went away.
           Richard understood a long time ago that if just did certain
   things without a grievance, or without too much of one he got special
   privileges, and this was a Friday. So he bundled up and went outside.
   Anyway he knew his friends would be around with some good smoke.

           A few hours later...

          Allen came home, he was all done in.
          Cherry Blossom looked at him and smiled, "Come here honey, let
   me help you."
         Then she proceeded to help him off with his boots, and gloves,
   and coat.
         "Go get these wet cloths off you and I'll make you some cocoa."
         "Afterwards you can watch some movies."
         "Did you see your brother around?"
         "Yes." Said Allen. "His friends came by and they went towards the
   woods."
         "Did he do Miss Robbies walk?"
         "Yes. But I was at Mark's house.
         "Well he better get home soon, it's getting dark outside."
         "Come on lets get you warmed up."

          Well sometime after Richard cleared Miss Robbie's walk and
   before he was done with his, his friends came over with some really
   good smoke.
          "Hey." He said as they came up to him.
          "Keef!" They responded.
          "What's up Doc?"
          "Well I got to finish this. Do you have anything green on you?"
           He stopped shoveling and really looked at his buddies then
   shook his head and said. "Stupid question."
           "Come on, one of his friends said, I've got some Heinekens in
   here take a break and lets go somewhere else.",
           "No I want to finish this, I'm almost done. If I do this maybe
   my mom will let Cindy stay over."
           "Well no beer for you until you finish."
           "It would go a lot faster if you help, there's more shovels in
   the garage."
           "No, I'm fine just watching you." said the other friend.
            Richard finally finished and all three of them trudged through
   the snow, about a football field away to their favorite wooded spot to
   drink and get high.
            They stayed long enough to drink a few beers and get toasty.

            "Well it's getting late and I'm beat said Richard, I'm going
   to go home. Wanna come over later, after dinner? We'll play."
             "Cool, I'll call you."
             "Hey, give me a little bud for the walk home."
             "You're lucky I'm so cool." Said Richard's friend.
              As Richard trudged back home he decided to save that bud and
   enjoy it in the garage.
              Inside the house Cherry Blossom put on The Wizard of Oz for
   Allen as she was making the soup. Every 15 minutes she would stop and
   look out the windows and doors for Richard.
   Finally she saw him walk up to the house and was relieved.
               Richard grabbed the shovels and work gloves and proceeded
   to take them into the garage. Great this is the perfect opportunity to
   hit the pipe one last time for a while, just to top everything off.
               Richard came in the back door and immediately sat down at
   the dinner table.
               "I Was getting worried a bit." Said Cherry Blossom.
               "Mom, I was O.K. But now I'm tired."
               "Well go change cloths, I'll make you some cocoa and a
   sandwich."
               "Great." Said Richard.
                From the kitchen Richard could hear the TV.
                "The Wizard of Oz. "Richard said.
                "Yeah I put it on for your brother." Cherry Blossom said.
                Richard peeked in and saw Allen curled up on the couch
   fast asleep. He smiled and left to go into his room.
                "He went back into the kitchen and said, "The guys want to
   come over later after dinner and play."
                 "Risk?" Asked Cherry Blossom.
                 "Yes."
                 "Oh, can't you play a peaceful game for once?"
                 "What game is that? I'll be right back, I'm going to go
   change."
                 Now it's a curious thing the way the house is situated.
   If you're in the back of the hallway you can look down and see the TV.
                  Richard went into his room to change and as soon as he
   did he turned on his music. Maybe because he was so tired from
   shoveling snow, and the grade of pot, he was in a certain mood so he
   put on Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon.
                  He put the music on then laid down on his bed for a time
   to let the pot really hit him.
                  Eventually he got up, changed, and went into the
   kitchen, but kept his music on.
                  As he was walking down the hall he thought he noticed
   something.
                  "Hum." He thought.
                  He went into the kitchen to get a root beer.
                 "I'll be right back I want to listen to the side of the
   album."
                  He went over to the TV and turned down the volume Allen
   was so out of it there was no chance for a protest.
                  He walked backwards down the hall, looking at the TV and
   listening to the music.
                 "This is freaky." He said to himself. He went into his
   bedroom and turned up the music and stood in the hallway just looking.
                  He was so engrossed he forgot he was holding a glass of
   root beer.
                  He just stood there as The Great Gig in the Sky ended.
                  Then suddenly he sort of woke up, anyway Cherry Blossom
   was on her way to get him, his cocoa was getting cold.
                  As he walked into the kitchen he thought the guys are
   going to trip all over this.
   We are so going to do this when they get here.
                  If dad gets home we'll just go down in the basement.
                  And that's how it all started.

                  The Wizard of Oz came on AMC yesterday and I remembered
   this story.
                  I had Linux Mint installed and took Windows off. Anybody
   else use it?

   To me the every day violence perpetrated by a system that allows so
   many, even those who aren't considered at poverty level but see their
   chances of a better life disappearing, while a small oligarchy takes
   and takes leaving less for the rest, is the crime that is at the root
   of most violence in society.

   When people are well paid and can see a better future on the horizon
   there is much less disagreement between differing groups of people.
   Groups that probably would have much less to argue over if they weren't
   in a constant rat race to to make ends meet.

   But we're not supposed to look at that.

   It's no wonder that republicans like Lindsey Graham and others are
   pushing about the latest bombing.
     Pointing their finger, as they nearly always do at "foreigners" or
   Muslims or "the others" to blame.
   It's what they do, when the tax code, or hazardous work places, (an
   endless list of wrongs to people and the environment)  is a way bigger
   enemy to way more people.

 The Joker nailed it. ([802]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [803]Dogs are fuzzy

   In The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger's Joker explains very elegantly what I
   think Rosenfeld is getting at:

     You know what I've noticed? Nobody panics when things go "according
     to plan." Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the
     press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of
     soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it's all "part of
     the plan." But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well,
     then everyone loses their minds!

   This line stuck in my mind and ever since, I've seen example after
   example.  Suffering, loss, and death, on their own and in roughly
   equivalent measure, do not guide the degree of attention paid; it's all
   about the context...and whether the events are "part of the plan - even
   if the plan is horrifying."  So, for some nothing little town on the
   outskirts of El Paso to get partially leveled by a reckless corporation
   thanks in part to lax oversight and pretty much nonexistent public
   safety protection (you'd think Texas [804]would remember a thing or two
   about ammonium nitrate explosions!!), nobody panics.  But if a couple
   of wound-up punks blow up a crowded recreational event in a fairly
   affluent city, well, everyone loses their minds!

   Don't believe me?  Senator Lindsey Graham wants Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to be
   charged as an "enemy combatant" - have his constitutional rights
   canceled.  I see where people are calling to have him publicly hanged.
    But the West, TX explosion is just some random industrial accident -
   except [805]it's not.

 I thought more or less the same thing ([808]0+ / 0-)

   Surrounded by information about this absolutely surreal "manhunt" I
   thought - "Yes, this is a bad event and yes the cops/FBi should be
   chasing the guy" but - like this?  Were they really dangerous to the
   extent of a military lockdown and search canvas pulling some clearly
   innocent families out of houses at gun point shouting at them?" and I
   thought - haven't there been other really bad mass murderers and really
   bad criminals sought, found and apprehended without looking like a
   really scary dystopian film?   And what about all of the crimes that
   aren't quite as bad but pretty bad?  What if this was the common
   reaction of law enforcement.

   Of course my answer was what it is - this is something different.
   Something wrong.  Something bad.   Something that redefined the
   landscape in my eyes - a lot.

 Guns trained on clear innocents forced out of home ([818]0+ / 0-)
       Won't go there and say it's OK.
       Have you seen the first person video of the agents in full body
       armor with trained assault rifles shouting at a scrawny, blonde
       young teen who clearly has no possible resemblance to the suspect -
       the part where the gun is trained on him and the agent screams "Get
       your hands on your head" as they force him and his family out of
       their home?
       [819]https://www.youtube.com/...
       If you actually watch it I am guessing you will be freaked out.  If
       you're not freaked out, all I have to say is - Sorry - this is NOT
       the way to deal with this.   The clear message here is "everyone is
       a suspect" - and how do you argue against that with this video
       evidence?
       I will say that I have been OK with being a "suspect" every time I
       get on a plane.   In that world I have been OK with proving my
       innocence.
       If I was this family in that video I wouldn't feel my life was made
       safer by this violation of my home and I would most likely need
       therapy - not caused by the bomber or his proximity to my house -
       but as a result of how I was 'perp walked' (because that is what
       you see here) for no reason that I would ever be explained.
       Are you OK with this?  Are you OK with your son being the blonde
       kid in the video?   Do you think that moment won't mess with his
       life for the rest of it?  Do you think that the value proposition
       that somehow this act made the country safer so it was OK for the
       law enforcement to act like this is a valid one?  I don't, won't
       and never will.
       Watch the video.  Tell me you are OK with that.

   not only do i know the victim (she was campaign manager for [928]Jane
   Dyer's run for congress which i volunteered for) but her alleged
   attacker, involved w/ the campaign, is a family friend - and my friend.
    i am shocked and saddened....  (i wonder if any kind of medication
   that has adverse reactions would make a person do this to his friends.
   does anyone know if a med would turn a normally wonderful person into a
   psychotic person who wants to kill friends??)

 You are guilty of wanting to have it both ways. ([932]0+ / 0-)

   Do you really want people to pay attention to their local crime
   stories? Seriously?  It's best to suppress those stories for the sake
   of harmony in the cities.

   But we are also supposed to believe that crime is dropping too.  So
   what do you want? Wall to wall national coverage of home invasions, gun
   battles at the hang outs, gang rapes? or the national news covering the
   occassional man bites dog story and not much else. I don't think your
   like the results of 24 /7 episodes of Cops. The state and social
   consensus would collapse.

   Ann Coulter has a really [942]fucktarded understanding of the First
   Amendment.

     Appearing on Fox News Republican talk show "Hannity" Monday night,
     right-wing columnist Ann Coulter said she's sad that not only does
     she think the Boston bombing should shut down the nation's
     immigration reform debate, she would like to see the alleged
     bomber's widow in jail too, not for committing a crime but for
     "wearing a hijab."

     "I don't care if she knew about this," Coulter said. "She ought to
     be in prison for wearing a hijab. This immigration policy of us, you
     know, assimilating immigrants into our culture isn't really working.
     They're assimilating us into their culture. Did she get a
     clitorectomy too?"

     Hannity seemed momentarily puzzled at the sudden citation of female
     genital mutilation, stammering his reply. "I, uh, I don't know the
     answer to that," he said before confidently adding: "But your point
     is well taken."

 Guardian has video of a 1962 Beatles appearance ([957]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [958]JeffW

   [959]here. From the article, by Ed Vulliamy::

     Around this time, in Britain in 1962, a young Russian speaker from
     Yorkshire called Leslie Woodhead joined Granada TV in Manchester as
     a junior researcher, whose job included "persuading ... local
     officials or champion knitters" to appear on a programme called
     People and Places. One week, a show featuring a brass band needed a
     further item. "There are these kids making a lot of noise in a
     cellar in Liverpool," advised a fellow researcher. "They haven't
     made any records yet."

     Woodhead duly met them for a drink, and shot the first film of them
     playing - a lunchtime gig at the Cavern - but transmission was
     delayed because of a problem with the brass band's union fees.
     Instead, Woodhead urged his producers to allow the Beatles into
     Granada's studio, and play on live TV for the first time. They sang
     Love Me Do and Some Other Guy. Four months later, they reached No 1
     with Please Please Me.

   In particular the article describes the impact of the Beatles in
   Russia, with one person saying, "Beatlemania washed away the
   foundations of Soviet society."
