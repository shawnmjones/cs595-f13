3rd person dies from Asiana crash; another victim was hit by fire truck

   By Greg Botelho and Amanda Watts, CNN
   updated 9:28 PM EDT, Fri July 12, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: All four runways at San Francisco's airport are now
       operational, airport says
     * A girl, who'd been in critical condition, died Friday morning at a
       San Francisco hospital
     * A teen who died earlier was hit by fire truck, police say
     * Her body was believed to be covered in foam sprayed by
       firefighters, spokesman says

   (CNN) -- A third person -- identified only as a girl -- has died from
   injuries sustained in last week's crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214,
   officials at the San Francisco hospital where she was being treated
   said Friday.

   San Francisco General spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said the "minor girl"
   had been in critical condition at the Bay Area hospital since last
   Saturday's incident. The hospital didn't release any information about
   the girl -- including her name, age or ethnicity -- who died Friday
   morning, according to Dr. Margaret Knudson, the hospital's chief of
   surgery.

   "It's a very, very sad day today at San Francisco General Hospital,"
   said Dr. Geoffrey Manley, chief of neurosurgery. "We have all done
   everything we could."

   Two other people -- both 16-year-old girls from China -- were reported
   dead soon after the Boeing 777 crash-landed at San Francisco
   International Airport.

   Plane crash-lands in San Francisco Plane crash-lands in San Francisco

   One of those teenagers was hit on the runway by a fire truck, though
   it's not clear whether she was already dead when she was struck, San
   Francisco police spokesman Albie Esparza told CNN on Friday.

   At the time, firefighters were using flame retardant that ended up
   surrounding areas immediately around the plane with foam, Esparza said.

   "When the truck repositioned itself to get a better aim of the
   fuselage, they discovered the body of the victim in the fresh track
   from the path of the truck," he added.

   The foam was thick enough to cover a body, Esparza noted. Moreover, it
   is difficult for those in the "industrial-size" fire trucks that
   responded to crash to see things on the ground, the police spokesman
   said.

   "Right now, we are waiting results from the coroner to determine if she
   died from the crash or the fire engine going over her," the police
   spokesman said. "And that will be part of our investigations, like any
   other case, by our hit-and-run and major accidents investigations
   teams."

   Of the passengers and crew on board, 304 people survived -- 123 of whom
   walked away relatively unscathed and the remainder sent to hospitals.

   A handful of them remained hospitalized, including six patients at San
   Francisco General as of 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) Friday. That hospital's
   figure include two adults in critical condition with spinal cord
   injuries, abdominal injuries, internal bleeding, road rash and
   fractures.

   Besides the passengers and crew members' physical recovery, San
   Francisco International Airport is working to get back to normal as
   well.

   The airport was shut down to incoming and departing traffic for several
   hours after the Asiana crash, which occurred around 11:30 a.m.
   Saturday. Two of its four runways reopened later that day, though the
   charred remnants of the downed 777 remained -- a visible reminder of
   the horror that had unfolded.

   Early Friday morning, that airline's fuselage was hauled away on
   flatbed trucks to a remote section of the airport, said San Francisco
   International Airport in a press release.

   By 5:05 p.m., a Southwest Airlines jet landed on the runway where the
   crash occurred -- signifying that, for the first time in six days, all
   four of the airport's runways were operational.

   "The tremendous efforts and around-the-clock work of airport staff,
   government agencies, airline tenants and contractors allowed us to
   complete all repairs and safety certifications for Runway 28L in a
   timely and efficient manner," said airport director John L. Martin.

   While the wreckage has been hauled away, investigators still have not
   pinpointed exactly why Flight 214 crashed, or who was to blame.
   NTSB: Pilot sees light before crash
   Asiana attendants return home
   New details emerge in plane crash

   An in-depth review of the cockpit voice recorder shows two pilots
   called for the landing to be aborted before the plane hit a seawall and
   crashed onto the runway, the head of the National Transportation Safety
   Board said Thursday.

   The first internal call by one of the three pilots in the cockpit to
   abort the landing came three seconds before the crash and a second was
   made by another pilot 1.5 seconds before impact, NTSB chief Deborah
   Hersman said.

   The agency has begun wrapping up its investigation at the airport and
   crews are cleaning up the debris left by the crash. Investigators
   turned the runway back over to the airport. The runway has been closed
   since Saturday's crash.

   The investigation is shifting back to NTSB headquarters in Washington,
   where authorities will work to find a more definitive answer about what
   led to the crash.

   The passenger jet's main landing gear slammed into the seawall between
   the airport and San Francisco Bay, spinning the aircraft 360 degrees as
   it broke into pieces and eventually caught fire.

   CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Augie Martin and Ed Payne contributed to this
   report.
