Gay marriage issue reaches Court (UPDATED)

   UPDATED Tuesday 7/3 at 3:55 p.m.    For those who wish to start
   following this case, it has now been docketed as 12-13.   The Court
   switched to new OT 12 numbers on the docket last week.

   ----------------

   Placing before the Supreme Court another huge cultural controversy, the
   House of Representatives' Republican leaders on Friday afternoon asked
   the Justices to uphold the constitutionality of the 1996 federal law
   that limits all federal programs and benefits for marriage to legal
   unions of a man and a woman.   This could set the stage for the
   Justices to take up the issue of same-sex marriage in their next Term,
   opening October 1.   The new petition is [30]here; the case does not
   yet have a docket number assigned.

   "This case calls out for the Court's review," the petition argued.  The
   First Circuit Court, it added, applied "an entirely novel form of
   scrutiny that cannot be reconciled with the approach of this Court and
   that of ten other circuits.  Thus, the decision below invalidates an
   act of Congress, conflicts with the decisions of this Court and
   numerous other courts of appeals, and embraces an entirely novel
   approach to constitutional equal protection analysis.  It is hard to
   imagine a stronger candidate for this Court's review."

   This is the first same-sex marriage case to reach the Court in a new
   round of lawsuits from coast to coast, with many of the cases focused
   on the law at issue in the new House GOP petition: the Defense of
   Marriage Act, passed with overwhelming majorities in the House and
   Senate and signed into law by President Clinton in 1996.   Soon to be
   filed at the Court is a case from California, testing the
   constitutionality of "Proposition 8," the voter-approved ban on
   marriage for gays and lesbians in that state.

   "Proposition 8'' has been struck down by a federal appeals court, as
   has DOMA in the case newly filed at the Supreme Court.  The California
   measure is a flat ban on same-sex marriage, but it is restricted to one
   state.   DOMA applies nationwide, and its section at issue in the new
   appeal does not seek to ban such marriages, but, when they are allowed
   under a state's own laws, denies all federal benefits to such couples.

   The GOP leaders of the House have taken up the defense of DOMA, in the
   wake of a decision last year by the Obama Administration to stop
   defending its constitutionality in court.   The Democratic leaders of
   the House have not joined in the defense of the Act, but courts have
   allowed the GOP leaders to take on the task and the Administration has
   encouraged them to get involved.   While not defending the law any
   more, the Administration insists that, since it is still on the books,
   it will enforce it while the court tests go on.

   The new petition sharply criticized the Administration for its actions
   on DOMA.   The GOP leaders, in fact, used that stance as a further
   argument why the Supreme Court should accept this case for review.

   They argued: "Separation of powers considerations strongly counsel in
   favor of this Court's review.  The executive branch has not only
   abdicated its traditional role of defending the constitutionality of
   duly-enacted statutes, but has simultaneously announced that it will
   continue to enforce DOMA.  As a result, the House has been forced into
   the position of defending numerous lawsuits challenging DOMA across the
   Nation.  That is a role for which the Justice Department -- not the
   House -- is institutionally designed.  Only this Court can settle this
   matter definitively."

   In the meantime, it said, the Administration will continue to attack
   DOMA in court, while also enforcing it, "thus creating more potential
   litigation for the House to defend."

   The First Circuit on May 31 struck down DOMA's Section 3, defining
   marriage for purposes of all federal laws and programs as "only a legal
   union between one man and one woman as husband and wife."   (Another
   part of DOMA, not at issue in this case, seeks to assure states that do
   not recognize same-sex marriages that they will not have to recognize
   such legal unions performed in other states.)

   In the House GOP petition, the First Circuit was attacked as having
   "invented a new standard of equal protection review that it described
   as involving `intensified scrutiny' and `closer than usual
   review.'...The court said that, under this newly minted form of
   judicial review, the `deference ordinarily accorded' to an Act of
   Congress is `diminished.' "

   This new standard, the leaders went on, was presented by the Circuit
   Court "as a fusion of federalism and equal protection concerns."  The
   standard it used, the petition added, "was outcome-determinative in
   this case, since the court acknowledged that DOMA satisfies rational
   basis review" (the lowest test of constitutionality of a law).

   The House GOP could have waited as much as three months before pressing
   its appeal to the Supreme Court.  By filing its challenge there in just
   a single month, it apparently sought to add urgency to the case.  Under
   normal procedures, the Court would not even consider whether to grant
   or deny the review until it holds its first Conference of the new Term
   in the week of September 24, ahead of the official opening of the new
   Term.

   The DOMA provision at issue in the case is also under review now in the
   Ninth Circuit Court.  Two federal District judges in California have
   ruled against it, and those cases are now on appeal.

   The Ninth Circuit is the appeals court that has struck down
   California's "Proposition 8," but it did on quite narrow grounds,
   largely limited to California.  That has raised the question whether
   the dispute in that case is broad enough to assure review by the
   Supreme Court.   The case was considerably broader when it was first
   filed by prominent attorneys Theodore B. Olson and David Boies, and
   when it was ruled upon by a federal District judge in California, who
   found it unconstitutional in a broad ruling.

   Proponents of the California ban have been expected to file a petition
   in the Supreme Court early this summer.

   The House GOP petition was filed at the Court Friday by Paul D.
   Clement, the prominent Washington, D.C., lawyer and former U.S.
   Solicitor General, who was a key lawyer in the Court's major cases this
   Term on the new federal health care law and Arizona's tough new
   immigration law.   Clement represented the 26 states challenging the
   health care law, and the state of Arizona in its defense of its
   immigrant-control law.  The Court did not strike down any of the new
   Affordable Care Act, but did strike down three of the four provisions
   of the Arizona immigration law at stake.
