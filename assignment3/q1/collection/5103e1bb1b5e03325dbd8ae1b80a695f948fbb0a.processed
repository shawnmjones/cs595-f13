   Max Foster on Prince William interview

   For now, he will focus on his royal duties. He will also expand on his
   conservation work, dealing particularly with endangered species.

   Kensington Palace announced he will become president of a new
   collaboration among seven environmental groups. The group, United for
   Wildlife, will focus on fighting the illegal wildlife trade.

   William will also focus on charities that deal with children, veterans
   and service members.

   William's final search and rescue duty was Tuesday. "He and his crew
   had an uneventful 24 hour shift," the defense ministry said.

   "Throughout his tour his airmanship, often in the most demanding of
   conditions, has contributed directly to saving lives in the mountains
   of North Wales and from the ravages of the Irish Sea. He has earned the
   respect of all who have worked with him as a highly professional and
   competent pilot," the ministry said.

   Last year, he helped save a teenage girl who was in danger of drowning
   off the coast of Wales.

   The 16-year-old girl was caught in a rip current and rapidly losing
   strength. William, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, had just landed
   a Sea King helicopter nearby, after going out on a routine exercise,
   when the alert was radioed through.

   In less than a minute, he and the crew had reached the scene and a
   paramedic was winched down into the sea to assist the exhausted girl,
   who had just gone under water.

   Prince William talks fatherhood

   There's no suggestion that William, 31, would ever drop out of public
   life, but he does crave normality. The prince gets some of that from
   his role in the military where he's treated as "one of the guys," but
   he also gets it from Africa.

   Dreaming of Africa is one way that William escapes from the stresses he
   faces, he said.

   "I regularly daydream," The Duke of Cambridge reveals in the CNN
   documentary, "Prince William's Passion: New Hope, New Father," which
   airs later this month.
