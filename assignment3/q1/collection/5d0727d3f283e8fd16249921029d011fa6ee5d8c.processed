   benton-harbor-city-hall.JPG Jonathan Oosting | MLive.comThe Benton
   Harbor City Hall is pretty quiet nowadays, after an emergency manager
   took over the finances.

   Editor's note: Michigan Decides 2012 is a six-week series in which
   MLive will explore the half dozen proposals facing Michigan voters on
   the Nov. 6 ballot. We kick it off with Proposal 1, a referendum on
   Public Act 4.

   Local representation is on hold in Benton Harbor, where a City Hall
   once populated by elected officials sits mostly empty. Where a phone
   full of unheard messages blinks behind a locked office door on the
   unlit second floor.

   It's been nearly three years since the state sent Joe Harris to Benton
   Harbor and tasked him with resolving the city's financial emergency.
   And it's been 18 months since Harris, using new power afforded by
   Michigan's so-called emergency manager law, stripped elected officials
   of all say in city government.

   Local leaders acknowledge Benton Harbor's ongoing struggles, but
   Harris' broad powers -- both exercised and understood - have elicited
   high-profile protests and public outcry.

PROPOSAL 1 WORDING

   A REFERENDUM ON PUBLIC ACT 4 OF 2011 -
   THE EMERGENCY MANAGER LAW

   Public Act 4 of 2011 would:

   o Establish criteria to assess the financial condition of local
   government units, including school districts.

   o Authorize Governor to appoint an emergency manager (EM) upon state
   finding of a financial emergency, and allow the EM to act in place of
   local government officials.

   o Require EM to develop financial and operating plans, which may
   include modification or termination of contracts, reorganization of
   government, and determination of expenditures, services, and use of
   assets until the emergency is resolved.

   o Alternatively, authorize state-appointed review team to enter into a
   local government approved consent decree.

   Should this law be approved?

   YES ___ NO ____

   "Public Act 4, from the beginning to the end, strikes at the heart of
   democracy," said
   Commissioner Marcus Muhammad, who earlier this month met with Harris
   for the first time in more than a year. "Under my view, it is
   absolutely in conflict with the core principles the nation was founded
   on."

   Critics say the law, updated and emboldened last year by Michigan's
   Republican-led legislature, raises big questions about representative
   government. But supporters say it is a working answer to a similarly
   large question: How should the state respond when local officials can't
   fix fiscal emergencies in cities and school districts?

   Harris has plenty of critics in Benton Harbor, and an independent audit
   of the city's 2011 fiscal year revealed persistent problems. But
   retired resident Rob McLaughlin said he prefers an emergency manager to
   an ineffective city commission.

   "The problem is that all people want to do is bitch and find the
   negative," he said. "But obviously the commission can't run the city.
   That's the bottom line."

   Michigan voters will decide the fate of the emergency manager law in
   November, when Proposal 1 will appear on ballots across the state. A
   "yes" vote will re-establish PA 4, which was temporarily suspended
   ahead of the referendum. A "no" vote will strike PA 4 from the books
   and, according to an opinion from the attorney general, result in
   reimplementation of PA 72, the state's previous law that provided
   emergency financial managers with fewer powers.

   OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW

   Individuals appointed by the state currently oversee the cities of
   Benton Harbor, Flint, Pontiac, and Ecorse along with public school
   districts in Detroit, Muskegon Heights and Highland Park. Appointment
   has been recommended in Allen Park. Three cities -- Detroit, Inkster
   and River Rouge -- are operating under consent agreements that extend
   some emergency powers to local officials.

   Financial struggles are nothing new for Michigan municipalities and
   school districts stretched thin by bloated pension costs, reduced
   revenue sharing, lost population and property taxes. The state has
   responded by adopting a series of increasingly tough laws, beginning
   with PA 101 of 1988, PA 72 of 1990 and now PA 4 of 2011.

   "I don't think anybody doubts that some process needs to be available
   for the state to intervene," said Bettie Buss, a senior research
   associate for the Citizens Research Council of Michigan. "The question
   is just how strong that process should be. Public Act 4 was the result
   of a widespread opinion that Public Act 72 wasn't strong enough."

   The new law built on the old in three key ways. First, it added
   early-detection mechanisms intended to help cities and school districts
   recognize and avoid potential emergencies.
   Second, it extended an emergency manager's role beyond finances. And
   third, it gave managers broader authority, including the ability to
   dissolve local bodies of government, make academic decisions in school
   districts and terminate or impose contracts on city workers.

   "We've seen emergency managers in some communities for a very long
   time, and the governor felt that with just a couple additional tools,
   some of these situations could be addressed sooner and more
   holistically," said Sara Wurfel, a spokesperson for Gov. Rick Snyder.
   "An emergency manager could get in, deal with the situation faster, and
   turn it back to the local community."

   Until it was temporarily suspended in August, PA 4 was on the books for
   nearly 17 months, providing emergency managers with multiple
   opportunities to exercise their new powers as they saw fit. But it's
   not clear whether those powers sped up the return to local control as
   intended.

   In Benton Harbor, Harris already had negotiated new union contracts
   under PA 72. But he used the new law to strip power from elected
   officials -- several of whom had fought his every move -- and continued
   to sell city assets in an attempt to balance the books.

   Harris did not respond to phone messages and emails requesting comment,
   but Mayor James Hightower and Commissioner Muhammad said the city
   remains in debt, owing vendors approximately $1.3 million.

   To speed up the city's recovery, Harris and a select group of
   cooperative commissioners are preparing to request a $7 million loan
   from the state, which recently raised the cap on emergency lending to
   municipalities and school districts in receivership.

   If the loan is approved, Hightower said the city could return to local
   control by the end of 2013. If not, the commission is looking at a
   five-year plan.

   "We've cut back to the bone," said the mayor, who has worked as a
   bridge between Harris and commissioners. "We can solve it, but by and
   large it would take a number of years to get there. Securing an
   emergency loan would put us in a huge position to correct the
   problems."

   Pontiac, run by state appointees since 2009, is in a similar situation.
   Current Emergency Manager Louis Schimmel and his predecessor Michael
   Stampfler used their powers under PA4 to eliminate pay for elected
   officials, sell various assets, turn over management of the city's
   wastewater plant to the county, and outsource fire and police service
   to neighboring communities.

   Despite those aggressive cuts and resulting savings, the city still
   faces a $5 million structural deficit. And so Schimmel placed on the
   November ballot a proposed millage increase for local property owners.

   "If we got the millage, the city's structural imbalance would be
   corrected and we would be that much closer to getting rid of the
   emergency manager and being back under home rule," said Mayor Leon
   Jukowski, who Schimmel brought back to City Hall as a paid consultant.
   "If we do not get the millage, nobody can predict how long we're going
   to be under emergency management."

   Emergency managers have broad powers to cut spending, but like elected
   officials before them, they face the challenging task of stabilizing
   revenues or finding new sources.

   "Just balancing the budget is addressing a symptom, but the underlying
   problem is what's happened to the economic base of these cities," said
   Buss. "Neither Public Act 72 or Public Act 4 really does anything to
   address that deeper problem of economic base erosion."
   THE BIG B WORD

   If a structural deficit is a symptom of municipal sickness, the state
   believes that the worst-case prognosis is Chapter 9 Bankruptcy.

   By empowering emergency managers to break contracts, Public Act 4 acts
   as "almost a quasi-bankruptcy process" designed to prevent the real
   thing, according to Eric Scorsone, a Michigan State University policy
   expert who helped write the law and train state appointees.

   Courts have yet to rule whether that power -- typically reserved for
   federal bankruptcy judges -- violates the contract clause of the U.S.
   Constitution, and several pending legal challenges are expected to move
   forward should voters approve the law.

   Bankruptcy offers struggling municipalities a chance to renegotiate or
   eliminate bonded debt, but a federal judge would decide the extent of
   that relief, and many observers believe the process would jeopardize
   credit ratings in surrounding communities and state government.

   "This is referred to as moral contagion," said Terry Stanton, a
   spokesperson for Treasurer Andy Dillon's office. "In addition, units of
   local government in other states which have filed for bankruptcy have
   found the process to be very lengthy and costly."

   This "contagion" is starting to be seen in California, according to
   Scorsone, where the city of Stockton filed for municipal bankruptcy in
   July. "But it's not huge. I think it's somewhat of an open question as
   to how much of an impact it would have."

   Republican Rep. Al Pscholka, who sponsored the bill that became Public
   Act 4, believes many residents outside of effected communities don't
   understand that repeal could impact the entire state.

   "Bankruptcy and bailout is really not where we want to go," said
   Pscholka, whose district includes Benton Harbor. "I mean, this is about
   fiscal responsibility. The worst thing that could happen is to have
   some of our larger cities that have been struggling go into municipal
   bankruptcy. It will affect everybody."

   But critics contend that the law is designed to protect outside
   bondholders at the expense of residents in struggling cities.

   "It's just patently obvious that the only winners under Public Act 4
   are the municipal bond market and the finance industry," said Greg
   Bowens, spokesman for the union-backed coalition that helped collect
   signatures to place the referendum on the ballot. "It's not just the
   bonds themselves, but the repayment terms. They are simply
   unsustainable for many cities.

   "The alternative is municipal finance reform. Providing a path to
   bankruptcy -- not that cities want to run there -- is a negotiation
   tool. It's leverage to try to get better rates on Wall Street and
   better repayment terms for those bonds that are out there."

   If voters do decide to repeal Public Act 4, the state is expected to
   continue its fight against municipal bankruptcy by revisiting the old
   law or promoting replacement legislation.

   "The question is how much they could enhance Public Act 72 without
   violating the will of the voters," said Buss. "Obviously there is a
   continuum of intrusiveness in terms of the state's participation in
   local government. The cap is a political cap. At what point do you set
   off the opposition again?"
