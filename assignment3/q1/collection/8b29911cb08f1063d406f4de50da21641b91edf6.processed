Intervention seems likely

   A young Free Syrian Army fighter is seen with his weapon in old Aleppo,
   August 25, 2013.
   Indications are growing that the United States, perhaps together with
   one or more other nations, will soon launch a limited military strike
   on Syria. What "soon" means is anybody's guess. Secretary of State John
   Kerry has cut his vacation short and will make a [30]statement at 2 PM
   ET that is likely to include stepped-up criticism of the Bashir Assad
   regime.

   The rationale behind a possible attack is the alleged government use of
   chemical weapons--specifically nerve gas--against the rebels. The
   regime denies this and is allowing U.N. inspectors to check out the
   site of an alleged chemical attack outside Damascus. The inspection
   team was said to be taking [31]sniper fire today as it carries out its
   mission. The administration says it is convinced chemical weapons
   [32]have been used. Nearly a year ago, President Obama called such use
   the crossing of a "red line" that would spur intervention if proved.

     "There is no doubt that when you start seeing chemical weapons used
     on a large scale," Obama told CNN Friday, "then that starts getting
     to some core national interests that the United States has, both in
     terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not
     proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases
     in the region."

   Support for and opposition to any military intervention [33]has crossed
   the lines of party and the political spectrum. Some opponents argue
   that President Obama must seek advance approval for any attack. But
   Congress is not scheduled to go into session again until Sept. 9. And
   the president did not seek such approval for the intervention in Libya.

   A civil war between the regime and rebels has been raging since March
   2011. The United Nations has reported that more than 100,000 lives have
   been lost, with no end in sight. More than four million Syrians are
   displaced inside the country and another estimated 1.8 million have
   fled to other nations.

   The United States has provided training, small arms and some funding
   for the rebels. Critics charge that this is risky because members of al
   Qaeda and other extremists are involved in the rebel ranks.

   U.S. warships are now in place in the Mediterranean and could provide
   platforms for launching cruise missiles or fighter-bomber attacks
   against Syria. Foreign Policy magazine [34]has posted a map of possible
   targets:

     On Friday, Anthony Cordesman of the influential Center for Strategic
     and International Studies said that anything less than (a pretty
     darn expensive) no-fly zone that totally grounds Assad's air force
     would be a "half-pregnant" solution similar to "supplying too few
     arms of too few lethality," as the U.S. and other nations have been
     said to be doing secretly for months without giving the rebels
     enough of an advantage to overthrow Assad.

     A full-on no-fly zone would involve the U.S. and any other nations
     launching a high end assault with everything from B-2 stealth
     bombers to submarine and ship-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles
     aimed at destroying Assad's radars, missile sites and air defense
     control networks. It'd be similar to what was done at the start of
     Operation Odyssey Dawn, only bigger due to the fact that Syria has a
     much better air defense network than Libya did. Once these
     door-kickers have taken out the most dangerous elements of Syria's
     air defenses, other strike fighters such as U.S. Air Force F-15E
     Strike Eagles, F-16 Vipers--some of which are already in neighboring
     Jordan--and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and
     F/A-18 Hornets would then be relatively free to hunt down and
     destroy Assad's aircraft on the ground or in the air.

   Please read below the fold for more about possible intervention in
   Syria.

     Sen. Bob Corker, R.-Tenn, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign
     Relations Committee, told Fox News Sunday that he expected a
     "surgical" response.

     "And I hope the president, as soon as we get back to Washington,
     will ask for authorization from Congress to do something in a very
     surgical and proportional way, something that gets [Assad's]
     attention, that causes them to understand that we are not going to
     put up with this kind of activity," Corker said.

   Go slow is the advice of others:

     Gen. Colin Powell, a former secretary of state and chairman of the
     Joint Chiefs of Staff, senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services
     Committee Jack Reed, D-R.I., and, to a lesser extent, Rep. Mike
     McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee,
     pleading to wait out the probe into the chemical weapons attack.

     Assad is a "pathological liar," Powell, who has dealt with the
     Syrian president in the past, said Sunday on "Face the Nation." But,
     he qualified, the rebels fighting against him might not be any
     better: "I have no affection for Mr. Assad," he said. "But at the
     same time, I am less sure of the resistance. What do they represent?
     And is it becoming even more radicalized with more al Qaeda coming
     in? And what would it look like if they prevailed and Assad went? I
     don't know."

   Kerry's statement may or may not provide clarity about whether and when
   the U.S. will strike.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   it wouldn't be happening in the first place if we hadn't sponsored it.
    It's like Iraq . . . where Saddam's worst was child's play compared to
   the devastation that we brought.  For all of Assad's sins Syria was
   better off before we started this thing to "get rid" of him, and it
   will be a long time before they get back to where they were before our
   intervention.  And if they do get back what they had we'll start
   another revolution or bomb them again.

   that over a million Iraqi refugees fled to Syria, because it was better
   there than in American dominated Iraq (and nothing even remotely like
   that had happened when Saddam was running the place)?

   And now hundreds of thousands of Syrians are fleeing into Turkey (and
   back into Iraq) because it's better there than getting killed in this
   newest American "humanitarian intervention"?

   That's the "facts on the ground", and yes, it's "obscene".  And it's
   not "conspiracy claptrap" to point out another fact . . . that we're up
   to our neck in causing it.

       see proof that we caused what was effectively the Syrian
       incarnation of the Arab Spring.  Are you trying to make an argument
       that if these refugees from Iraq weren't there, then the middle
       class uprising that took place in spring 2011 either would not have
       happened (which makes zero sense) or would have been more easily
       suppressed by Assad?
       Other than that, I don't where you're going.  Iraq refugees to

       that the killing and car bombing and general armed terror and
       destruction in Syria is not a "middle class uprising" but rather
       the co-option of otherwise peaceful protest by American and Saudi
       trained, armed and funded forces.  And you "fail to see" that it
       was not done for either "humanitarian" reasons or for the benefit
       of the Syrian people.
       There were, and are, lots of ways we could have supported that
       "middle class uprising" without destroying the Syrian middle class
       by killing them and/or driving them out of the country as refugees.
        Just as there would have been a lot of ways to support the Iraqi
       middle class without killing them and destroying their wealth and
       country.  But no . . .

   at the hands of Assad, that brutal, evil, tin-horn, psychopathic SOB.

   Consider this. There is little doubt that Qaddafi would have subjected
   his nation to the same kind of bloodletting, had we not intervened in
   Libya. We and our allies provided a limited support role and the people
   rose up to take control of their country. Of course, things are not
   perfect in Libya now either. That's how revolutions work. There are no
   guarantees people will always do things we like. But, it's their
   country. They get to decide. And if anyone thinks keeping Qaddafi in
   power because "No More War" then they are out of effing minds.

   We took the opposite approach in Syria as we did in Libya and it has
   had tragic, disgusting, shameful results. The question is not whether
   we should intervene now. It is: How can we sleep at night for not
   having acted sooner?

   IMNSHO, any direct military intervention in Syria was always highly
   problematic, still is, and most likely always will be. Nevertheless, it
   seems that at some point, quite possibly sooner than later, President
   Obama will decide that a certain course of direct interventionist
   action will be better than basically continuing as the US has been
   doing, because the situation there just continues to get worse and
   worse while the US maintains its current policies. It seems abundantly
   clear (at least to me) that Assad is quite willing to visit an
   unimaginable disaster on Syria in general in order to maintain his
   present position. The US may well be faced with the necessity of
   choosing what seems to be the least terrible option.

 Where's the evidence that Assad used the weapons ([450]0+ / 0-)
       His regime is despicable, no doubt, but the al-Nusrah rebels are
       al-Qaida guided and are themselves committing horrible atrocities
       esp against Shiites, Kurds, Christians and other minorities in
       Syria. As bad as Assad's regime has been, he isn't actively wiping
       out villages of despised ethnic groups, and for that matter, many
       of the rebels seem to be foreign fighters shuttled in by Turkey,
       Saudi Arabia and others. It makes no sense to basically support
       al-Qaida in Syria when they're still launching operations against
       US forces in Afghanistan!
       Besides again, where's the evidence that the regime was the one
       using the weapons? Almost all the comments on the NYT for example
       are strongly against intervention, and a good number of them have
       pointed out that experts in chemical weapons either doubt their use
       or suspect that rebels might have used them themselves-
       [451]http://www.dailykos.com/...
       Not saying this should make the decision for us, but it would be
       wise to wait until we have more information and confirmation before
       getting drawn into what could become a regional conflict that would
       benefit only the neocons and arms makers. This is why the vast
       majority of Americans are opposed to intervention here, and rightly
       so. This would be an ample opportunity to apply the painful lessons
       from Iraq.

   bombing those sites might just release a poisonous gas cloud.

   Chemical weapons are used to terrorize.  They are not very effective in
   terms of tactical use.  They are very effective in controlling civilian
   populations - as Iraq learned in 1988.  But getting rid of them?
   Surgically?  Very difficult.

   But... I agree with you. Using them is not acceptable. The most likely
   response will be to make it much harder for the Syrian regime to use
   helicopters, which seem to have been used in these last attacks.  (Jets
   are not very accurate or effective, other means of delivery seem not to
   be used by the Syrian government.)

   does not mean that Assad has none - especially since the UN, which
   could not find them in Iraq, has found them in Syria. One of these
   things is NOT like the other.

   Denying that Assad has chemical weapons is going to make you look
   silly. If you want to oppose intervention, base it on some different
   argument.

       And I am willing to entertain the idea that the rebels captured
       some sarin, or it was brought over by defectors.
       The wholesale use, however, seems to be unique to Assad. Deployment
       of these weapons in large scale generally requires planes or
       artillery, both of which are found more on the government side.

     That's because extremist groups, some identified with Al Qaeda, have

       It's an honest question, not saying you're wrong but I just don't
       understand strategically how it would unfold. Wars have a way of
       confounding those who think they can keep it under control, as
       World War I notoriously showed (Guns of August) and of course
       Vietnam and Iraq more recently.
       Syria is very different from Libya, in that both Iran and Russia
       have a strong interest in opposing a US intervention there. On top
       of that, Iraqi Shiites (whom we empowered next door) are far more
       likely to support the Assad regime against us.
       I guess one could make the case that cruise missile strikes could
       be "limited and punitive" but I don't really see how even that
       would work. What if for example it turns that the chemical weapons
       were used by the al-Nusrah rebels (who are al-Qaida guided,
       well-trained and armed), and we were duped into launching cruise
       missiles against Assad? What if our intervention emboldens
       al-Nusrah to carry out genocidal attacks on Kurds, Alawites and
       Christians (they're often Wahhabi extremists and this is already
       occurring)?
       I don't see any way that intervention at this point would lead to
       anything other than an utter disaster, which is probably why the
       vast majority of Americans in polls strongly oppose going in there.

       the [813]facts on the ground in Libya...

     A report from Amnesty International this week warns the country is
     in the `stranglehold' of hundreds of militias acting above the law.
     The organisation says widespread human rights violations - arbitrary
     arrests, detention, torture (sometimes to death), unlawful killings
     and forcible displacement of families - are rife in the country.

     The levels of repression are reaching those that sparked the
     revolution against Gaddafi in the first place, and, according to the
     charity, methods of torture include `suspension in contorted
     positions and prolonged beatings with various objects, including
     metal bars and chains, electric cables, wooden sticks, plastic
     hoses, water pipes and rifle-butts'.

     TRIPOLI, Libya, May 14 (UPI) -- Eighteen months after the downfall

     created a security crisis that's driving off desperately needed

     The energy-rich North African state is in a constant state of uproar
     and anxiety, riven by ideological, religious and tribal rivalries.
     Egypt and Tunisia, where pro-democracy uprisings overthrew longtime
     dictators earlier in 2011, are also in turmoil but Libya is armed

       The suffering already was in full-blown mode when Gaddafi's troops
       were headed for Benghazi, where shelling Misrata, and subjugating
       Zawia to pure terror.  In fact, it's not even close to comparable
       to that right now, no matter what you may choose to believe.
       But hey, feel free to think that it is all so much worse now than
       when the "benevolent" Gaddafi was slaughtering his people, if
       that's what floats your boat.
       That you would try and make that point based on the back of a Saudi
       "analyst" who is close the Saudi Royal Family is very telling, in
       an ironic sort of way.

 Legit concerns but who's committing the gneocide? ([850]0+ / 0-)

   Assad is awful, but the al-Nusrah rebels, backed by al-Qaida, have been
   specifically targeting Kurds, Christians, Alawites and other minorities
   with the intent of imposing a theocratic regime in Syria, which for all
   its flaws has been more religiously tolerant than its neighbors,
   certainly more than our "allies" like Saudi Arabia.

   Still I agree with you overall, haven't come to any conclusions on what
   we should do. Best to wait this out and try to sort things out in the

   But I will give an answer.  Chemical weapons use against civilians is
   unacceptable.  The regime has been using them in a more limited way
   since April, with no response.  This probably crossed the line.  If
   there is no international response, the use of chemical weapons will
   almost certainly increase - it is a bad time to be a resident of a
   densely populated, low-income opposition neighborhood right now,
   because you stand an increasingly good chance of being sprayed like an
   aphid on a rosebush.

   We face this problem:  For the last five decades, we've weakened the
   international structures to address issues like this.  We don't have an
   effective UN to confront the use of chemical weapons. The UK and France
   are more hawkish than the Obama Administration, but it remains to be
   seen whether they are able or willing to respond, since the US has
   taken on way too exclusive a role in responding to crises like this.
   But here is where we are in 2013: No effective UN, terrible timing
   (Iran diplomacy will suffer and Russian relations are at their wost in
   30 years), and the UK and France not being able to take the lead.

   But doing nothing seems to me not an option.  Do you have a sense of
   what an effective response might be to control use of chemical weapons
   against civilians?  Or is there no responsibility to control the use of
   these weapons?

 Again, where is the evidence? ([948]0+ / 0-)

   No doubt the Assad regime is repugnant, but where is the evidence that
   they have used the weapons? Again it doesn't add up, the regime's been
   heavily defeating the rebels with conventional weapons, so why use chem
   weapons right now, just as the UN inspection team has arrived, and
   right near where they're staying? There were prior accusations of
   chemical attacks that pretty much flamed out.

   And I'm sorry, but I don't buy into the "limited intervention" claim
   either. Especially given the interests of Iran, Iraq and Russia in
   Syria, if we go in even with a limited cruise missile attack, it'll be
   very hard to extricate ourselves from the conflict. The harshest lesson
   of the Iraq conflict is that once we get sucked in, it's very hard to
   pull back out, and extremely costly either way. We really need to get
   the intelligence absolutely right on this.

       Russia currently supplies much of europe with gas, this give Russia
       huge leverage on the world stage. Qatar is trying to put a new

       Assad is an ally of Russia and will not let the pipeline in syria

       Why would Iran need Syria for a pipeline to Turkey?  That doesn't

   around this.

   We don't really want Assad to win; and we don't really want the rebels
   to win because they are dominated by Al-Queda.  Reminds me a little of
   the Iran/Iraq war of the 80s.

   I read an article in the NY Times yesterday (an opinion article) nthat
   suggested the US national interest is that the war just continue with
   no party strong enough to prevail.   Found the analysis interesting.

   The use of chemical weapons intorduces another factor.

   My expectation is cruise missles that damage Assad, but do not weaken
   him so much that rebels prevail.   We'll see.

   are doing most of the fighting, but they're not going to be able to
   rule Syria.  The problem over the longer term is that this plays into
   the wider tendency toward ethnosectarian conflict, with the Syrian
   government seen as "Shia" (not exactly accurate - dominated by Alawis,
   which is different), and the opposition as Sunni.  The conflict is
   already intensifying ethnosectarian fighting in eastern Syria and
   western Iraq.  Kurdish forces (mostly Syrian, but almost certainly with
   some Iraqi KDP pesh merga) have started to engage "al Qaeda of Iraq and
   Syria" forces near Raqqa and south of Sinjar, which has resulted in
   40,000 people fleeing to Iraqi Kurdistan over the last two weeks.
   Along the easter border of Syria, it's hard to distinguish between the
   ongoing low-level conflict in Iraq, and the Syrian civil war.  The two
   conflicts are merging.  And it's not exactly the same conflict as in
   Western Syria.  The Kurds don't care for Assad, but they see their main
   threat as coming from Sunni fundamentalists.  So it is more accurately
   a smaller war within a larger one.

       It's a hard call to say we'd refrain on that basis (prolonging the

       advantages out of. A replacement might not be so amenable to

       Most Syrians more obvious reasons are tired of the civil war and

   Is that a good thing? Maybe yes, maybe no. The problem is that the
   Assad regime is a minority government that lost legitimacy long ago for
   most Syrians. They could hold on, but sooner or later it will all come
   crashing down - and sometimes delay makes the ultimate explosion worse.
   Iraq would likely not have descended into such chaos had the regime
   fallen after the first Gulf War. But you add another decade of extreme
   repression, especially of the Shia' community, and a decade of
   containment/sanctions, and then you see an ethnosectarian conflict that
   is arguably worse and which is still not finished.  It may be that
   Assad will remain in power, but the bill will come due eventually, and
   perhaps at even greater cost.

       Assad is Alawite, associated with the Shia community, if anything
       the accusations of repression have been of the Sunni community. In
       any case there are polls showing that the Syrian people
       understandably are war-weary and sick and tired of the fighting,
       and ironically are supporting the Assad regime here since so many
       al-Qaida fighters are among the rebels, so this may ironically be

   the U.S. foreign-policy establishment, including the "serious people"
   of both parties, overthrowing the Assad regime would deprive Iran of
   its major regional ally. Israel has been trying to goad the U.S. into
   intervention for more than a year now. The reason why we'd intervene on
   the side of Islamic extremists is simple: proxy war with Iran. Toward
   the Iranians the U.S. has the same basic mindset that it had toward the
   U.S.S.R.

   One upshot of an attack on Syria is that it would effectively foreclose
   any possibility of a negotiated settlement with Iran over the nuclear
   issue. Which is precisely what the Democratic & Republican war hawks
   want.

 Should Assad win, do you really think ([1494]0+ / 0-)

   he's going to run the country peaceably?  Of course he's going to keep
   on hunting and killing purported rebels, sympathizers, supporters.  The
   murdering and terrorizing of the Sunni populace is going to continue.
   Until the next rebellion, and the next, and the next, until one finally
   succeeds.

   If the rebels win it will be the opposition running the place.  Now,
   they might well be horrible and hunt, kill, and expel Assad
   sympathizers.  But in some sense it's inevitable that at some point
   they gain power and do these thing.

   So there's no "everybody pick up their things and go home" peaceful
   solution.  We're at the beginning of an evolution in Syria and the best
   way to maximize the body count is probably to keep/leave Assad in power
   for as long as possible.  There's no guarantee that toppling him
   quickly will minimize the total body count, but it's plausible.

       a secret false-flag operation would have,  it is utterly crucial
       to know without doubt.
       Hard-core al Qaeda operatives, given what we've seen of their
       dedication and depravity, can easily be imagined doing this to put
       Assad on the spot.  In a heartbeat, if they could.   If there is
       any chance that this could be the scenario,  we need to be extra
       careful or we could be very skillfully played.
       There are many unknowns beyond the 3500 exposures to and 350
       fatalities from suspected Sarin nerve agent confirmed by MSF and a
       thorough forensic scientific study of the crime is going to take
       some time if we want to find out what happened and whodunnit.

   Assad & Al Qaeda. There's no reason to be simplistic.

   In fact, I suspect we have already been doing this.  The problem is too
   many civilians have been dying. Unfortunately, we don't have evidence
   that any action we take will stop the targeting of civilians.

   There's no easy answer.

   Obama as cited

     "There is no doubt that when you start seeing chemical weapons used
     on a large scale," Obama told CNN Friday, "then that starts getting
     to some core national interests that the United States has, both in
     terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not
     proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases
     in the region."

   The use of such weapons isnt proliferation is it? If it were
   nonproliferation anyone would be after, then they would have to help
   Assad suppress the rebellion because its been a track record that that
   regime dont go around and sell them on local flea markets.

   "protect our bases and allies" ?? In Syria?? that is on the face
   unbelievable, or twisted. Its like blaming someone who you have hit
   with a fist that they put their face in your fists way.

   when it is quite clear that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons
   on civilians. I think the Obama Administration is especially reluctant
   to act right now because of the diplomatic opening with the new Iranian
   president, and because it's hard to see any single limited action that
   would be particularly effective. I think Pres Obama is looking at a
   limited attack, probably on airfields or air radar installations, but
   not much more than that.

   The UK and France have both had confirmatory evidence of chemical
   weapons attacks since April.  I've seen the videos of the individuals
   in the hospitals in Syria, and it seems pretty clear to me that this is
   not fabricated.  MSF also put out a press release saying that they had
   treated hundreds of persons with injuries consistent with nerve agents.

   Of course, we once again are undermined by our history.  Foreign Policy
   just published an article on recently declassified CIA documents that
   show that the Reagan Administration knew perfectly well that Saddam
   would use chemical weapons, and provided intelligence allowing them to
   target those weapons more effectively.

   [1821]http://www.foreignpolicy.com/...

   I don't think we will ever be done with the foreign policy disaster
   we've inherited from the Reagan Administration.  The roots of so much
   we are facing today date from that decade... in Iraq (and thus the rest
   of the Middle East), Congo, Central America, Afghanistan.  What a
   nightmare... what a disaster.

 Well, in my opinion ([1906]0+ / 0-)

   it all goes back to the Civil War.  Every generation since 1865 has
   fought military conflict in a new part of the world.  And the end
   result, whatever the wars were "about" per se, was bleeding out and/or
   destruction of some anti-democratic force(s).   And the germination of
   liberal democracy there.

   These days Western North America, the Atlantic/Pacific/Caribbean
   islands, Western Europe, East Asia, and Eastern Europe have pretty much
   become liberal democratic and without serious anti-democratic menaces.
    And have quite probably fought their last nation-state wars.

   This present generation of wars and warlets and such- since 1990/91- is
   against the dictators and authoritarians and warlords and such of West
   Asia.

   It would great if it were all over after that.  But the next arena will
   fairly inevitably be in Africa- the last continent to be purged.  The
   Arab Spring has greatly diminished the problem on the continent's
   northern edge.  South Africa has seen to forming a relative haven of
   peace and democratization in the southern end of the continent, though
   that has stalled at Zimbabwe.  That leaves the equatorial part with all
   its dictators and violence.

       Even my mother. And since it's a "rebel controlled" area that the
       convoy was driving into, they would be the first to know about the
       convoy's route, for several reasons. One being that rebel groups
       are our/UN's primary contacts in all parts of Syria(not to go too
       overboard in stating the obvious or anything).
       Another obvious point being the Syrian army is in stand down mode
       in that immediate area, so anyone unscrupulous playing about in the
       buffer zone may have an advantage. There are several other players
       who would stand to lose, if the chem attack were proven to be
       opposition related, or even if this were all some horrible accident
       e.g. some insecticide stockpile being hit during a pitched battle
       with the Syrian army.
       I for one can't trust this evidence they claim to have
       acquired...how? Before the UN team even arrived. This leaves the
       only possibility as something being spirited out by a jihadi merc

   And to be clear my opinion is based on no knowledge or skill

   war has weakened Asad to the point that US and European planners think
   they can pull off something similar to Libya.  That is, with a little
   bit of bombing and logistical support, they can create the conditions
   where Asad is overthrown.

   To be clear, I have no idea if this is true, and even if it was, I'm
   not saying its a good idea.

   There does seem to be a serious difference in that Russia is still
   supporting Asad...and there are going to be serious ripples into
   Turkey, lebanon, Egypt, Israel, Iran and the gulf states.

       The side of intervention. No matter which party controls the White

       is always toward intervention. Both parties espouse notions of
       American "exceptionalism", the belief that the U.S. is such a
       uniquely righteous country that it need not feel bound by
       international law or the rules of war, need not respect other
       countries' sovereignty. Both parties believe in using U.S. military
       power to achieve their foreign-policy goals. Both believe that the
       use of military power, in & of itself, is always right & just -
       doesn't matter which side we're on. The goal here is to deprive
       Iran of its crucial regional ally; if that means aligning with al

       First, it is generally accepted that the use of chemical weapons is
       unlawful/wrong.  This is not the case with artillery.  If you want
       to have a concept of international law there needs to be
       consequences for violation.
       Second, unlike artillery, chemical weapons are particularly useful
       against civilian populations.
       Third, I suspect unprepared civilian populations will have an
       easier time surviving artillery strikes at the level that the
       Syrians can generate.

   I see a lot of headlines saying (in the all-revealing passive voice)
   "chemical weapons were used." I see very little to verify who used
   them. Each side accuses the other.

   As in Afghanistan, as in Iraq, as in Egypt, as in a thousand other
   places, sending the US military (or NATO military) into a confused
   multi-party civil war seems to me a recipe for killing the wrong people

   is a phrase I would love to see eliminated from the English language
   altogether.

   There is no such thing. There is no easy intervention in Syria. Once
   the USA decides to go to war there (and make no mistake, a missile
   strike means war), then the USA is either committed to seeing what
   could be a very long war through all the way to the end, or risks
   simply pouring more gasoline on the conflagration and leaving it behind
   to burn.

   There are no easy answers, and the notion of standing by as the
   horrific slaughter continues seems unbearable. But we also must
   remember the lesson of Afghanistan -- "freedom fighters" opposing the
   Soviet invasion turned into our worst nightmare.

   a situation where the Syrians have resorted to chemical weapons as
   their munitions supplies have dwindled

     On Friday, Anthony Cordesman of the influential Center for Strategic
     and International Studies said that anything less than (a pretty
     darn expensive) no-fly zone that totally grounds Assad's air force
     would be a "half-pregnant" solution similar to "supplying too few

     said to be doing secretly for months without giving the rebels
     enough of an advantage to overthrow Assad.

       though I sympathize with your larger point about the problems of a

       IMHO, waging war without conscription in a functioning democracy is
       morally wrong. Democracies by their very definition should be
       expected to be the very last nations to ever go to war precisely
       because we govern ourselves and bear the weight of the decision. As
       it turns out, the military-industrial-neocon complex figured out a
       whole bunch of ways to work around that problem in the
       US---including ripping war powers away from the people's
       representatives in Congress.
       Frankly, historians might just as realistically point to that
       unconstitutionality as the beginning of the end of our democracy,
       if we eventually manage to fail in it.

       Well, in Egypt the popular uprising hasn't quite wrested back
       control yet since the military still is in control, but most
       Egyptians actually would agree with your theory that The Obama
       Administration is supporting the MB.  I don't think that's the
       case, but I understand the frustration of Egyptians with shoddy
       coverage about the situation there in western media and also their
       frustration with western governments not fully understanding what
       happened there.
       The Feb. 17th Brigade, although Islamist, wasn't an Al Qaeda
       affiliate.  I think you're confusing them with Ansar Al Sharia.
       The reason why Feb. 17th were guarding the embassy is because they
       were one of the Benghazi brigades that was officially working with
       the Libyan Govt. in the transition stage that is lasting until
       official police and army forces can be built by the Libyan state.
       I agree with you that the rebellion in Syria has been, in parts,
       co-opted by extremist Islamist forces.  That doesn't mean that all
       the rebels are the same, though.  There is still quite a variety
       there.

     The United States has been consulting with its allies about possible
     responses, and on Monday the foreign ministers of Britain, France
     and Turkey said in separate radio interviews that they would be
     prepared to back U.S. action outside the parameters of a United
     Nations mandate

     Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the Turkish Milliyet
     daily newspaper that more than 35 nations are considering joining
     the United States in taking action against Syria, and that Turkey
     was among them.

       I'm not saying there isn't, but how is choosing not to intervene
       evidence of hypocrisy?
       And incidentally, there is a huge irony that after three decades of
       US foreign policy decisions that have been rife with hypocrisy,
       that any citizen of this country could comment with a clear
       conscience on the hypocrisy of other nations.

       Im actually a German citizen. course you cant know this. I said
       hypocrisy because I know well enough that just before an election,
       noone will want to waken the troubles of having a german military
       involved in soemthing that could be seen as an adventure. Theyll
       be content to let others do it and given like Merkel is Im sure
       shed rather pay to be left out of it. (A model with tradition).
       She could only lose by this. Just maybe, if it goes through NATO,
       they might agree to support roles in hte wider mediterranean. But
       nowhere near where its hot and where a german soldier could get
       killed or could actually kill someone inconvenient.
       if it turns out different I would be very surprised (and not
       necessarily pleased).

   Germany could deploy special vehicles that can detect chemical weapons.

   They also have jet fighters who can help to fill up other fighter jets

   I doubt that Merkel would resist demands from the US and other NATO
   nations to engage and help in the mission.  They will muddle along with

       But the problem with the UN is Russia, who back Syria.
       Basically, the question comes down to how large the coalition is.
       Is it the bullshit Iraq war coalition, or the more broad based
       Libya coalition.
       I don't know, but I suspect Obama ain't gonna do shit without a

       I will not support anything without that broad coalition, and I
       might not even support if he does get that coalition, but I will

   the problem is that sides there cant really win over each other

   not even the Serbs could subdue the Bosniaks, who were the last ones
   even wanting a fight.

   one could say ... satnd back, grind your teeth, watch it burn out ...
   unless ... after some time of that burning wont there be more dead as
   if when someone really had walked in and wiped the floor?

   but even if one did, what then? Back to mandate administration? Not

   were prepared to do in their colonies.

 You know, you're probably more or less right ([2412]0+ / 0-)

   about this.

   The only time for a relatively "painless" liberal intervention would,
   indeed, have been at the very beginning, before it turned into a
   civil/sectarian style war.

   This was my great fear in the beginning and Russia should hang its head
   in shame for propping up Assad instead of putting heavy-duty pressure
   on him to reform.

   At this point, I'm not really sure what could or should be done
   anymore, other than supporting refugees, arming the Kurds to stave off
   Al Qaeda-linked Al Nusra, and, possibly, arming the most moderate
   elements of the FSA.

   British lost at Saratoga before France went to the outright aid of the

   Franklin that long, it's no easier today. He was the personification of

   Given that Assad is a bastard and Al Qaeda his likely successor,

   It is disappointing to see that your diary simply reports facts and
   takes a neutral stance on the issue.  I know from our comment exchanges
   with you yesterday that you oppose the intervention but you did not
   write it clearly  here today in this diary that has a lot of exposure.

   Why do you want to appear neutral on the issue?  This is not the time
   for "neutrality".   An attack on Syria would be pure insanity and may
   have unpredictable consequences and inflamme the whole middle east.
   If Russia gets involved, the outcome would be horrifying.

   Any attack is also not justified.  There is not proof that Assad used
   the chemicals.  In fact, it would have been against his own interests
   to do so because he is winning over the jihadist rebels using
   conventional weapons.  To me it is much more likely that the rebels use
   the chemicals to provoke an intervention.

   The fact that the Obama administration is getting ready to attack
   another country without even having the facts straight is scary.   It
   shows that Obama was unable to stand up to the neocons and that the
   hawks won the internal debate in the white house.

   Thinking people and liberals should oppose such an attack,
   independently of the fact that a democratic administration is in power.
     Bombing a dense city like Damascus with cruise missiles will
   undoubtedly result in heavy civilian casualties and it will be a crime.
    Really scary to see that this may really happen.

   1949 when the "Department of War" became the "Department of Defense."

   By simply changing the name, Americans were deluded to think that ANY
   time the United States took military action, it was in the "defense of
   our national interests."

   No.  Any time the United States takes military action, it's an act of
   war.  We should demand that the name be changed back to the War
   Department.  Then, any time a politician felt it necessary to intervene
   in a foreign conflict, there would be no question about it, we are
   going to war.  It's not "defense," it's not "policing," it. is. war.

   I maintain that more lives are lost with a "Defense Department" than
   with a "War Department."  Perhaps if we had called it what it really
   was, several costly "defenses" could have been avoided, and thousands
   of dead Americans would still be with us, not to mention hundreds of
   thousands of foreign civilians.

   I see no upside to intervening in another civil war.  History tells us
   that no matter how noble the reason, the result is massive human
   carnage.

   When Syria threatens the United States with chemical weapons, then by
   all means take them out.  Until then, chill.

 John Kerry's Statement - Transcript: (excerpts) ([2887]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [2888]NYFM

     KERRY: .... And today, I want to provide an update on our efforts as
     we consider our response to the use of chemical weapons. What we saw
     in Syria last week should shock the conscience of the world. It
     defies any code of morality. Let me be clear: The indiscriminate
     slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children and
     innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity. By any
     standard, it is inexcusable and -- despite the excuses and
     equivocations that some have manufactured -- it is undeniable.

     The meaning of this attack goes beyond the conflict in Syria itself,
     and that conflict has already brought so much terrible suffering.
     This is about the large-scale, indiscriminate use of weapons that
     the civilized world long ago decided must never be used at all, a
     conviction shared even by countries that agree on little else.
     ...

     So I also want to underscore that while investigators are gathering
     additional evidence on the ground, our understanding of what has
     already happened in Syria is grounded in facts, informed by
     conscience, and guided by common sense.
     ...

     Moreover, we know that the Syrian regime maintains custody of these
     chemical weapons. We know that the Syrian regime has the capacity to
     do this with rockets. ...

     I spoke on Thursday with Syrian Foreign Minister Muallem, and I made
     it very clear to him that if the regime, as he argued, had nothing
     to hide, then their response should be immediate, immediate
     transparency, immediate access, not shelling. Their response needed
     to be unrestricted and immediate access. Failure to permit that, I
     told him, would tell its own story.

     Instead, for five days, the Syrian regime refused to allow the U.N.
     investigators access to the site of the attack that would allegedly
     exonerate them. Instead, it attacked the area further, shelling it
     and systemically destroying evidence. That is not the behavior of a
     government that has nothing to hide. That is not the action of a
     regime eager to prove to the world that it had not used chemical
     weapons.

     In fact, the regime's belated decision to allow access is too late,
     and it's too late to be credible. Today's reports of an attack on
     the U.N. investigators -- together with the continued shelling of
     these very neighborhoods -- only further weakens the regime's
     credibility.

     At President Obama's direction, I've spent many hours over the last
     few days on the phone with foreign ministers and other leaders. The
     administration is actively consulting with members of Congress, and
     we will continue to have these conversations in the days ahead.
     President Obama has also been in close touch with leaders of our key
     allies, and the president will be making an informed decision about
     how to respond to this indiscriminate use of chemical weapons.

     But make no mistake: President Obama believes there must be
     accountability for those who would use the world's most heinous
     weapons against the world's most vulnerable people. Nothing today is
     more serious, and nothing is receiving more serious scrutiny.

     Thank you.

   Now in how many days will the bombings start? Our office starts taking
   bets about it. My boss thinks within one and a half weeks.

   I think I'll take vacations.

   Just doing my part to piss off right wing nuts, one smart ass comment

   I truly don't know what should be done.  I don't really want to get
   involved in Syria, but at the same time Assad shouldn't be allowed to
   use chemical weapons on his own people with impunity.  The situation in
   Syria is tragic.
