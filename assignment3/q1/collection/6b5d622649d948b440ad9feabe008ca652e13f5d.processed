[22]Can we stop an object from hitting the earth?

   The recent event in Siberia has given new urgency to a decades old
   question: Can we stop one of these things or not? The answer depends on
   several variables ranked in the following order of importance: how much
   lead time we have, how massive it is, and how it's put
   together--asteroids and comets vary a lot in composition. Some are icy,
   some are rocky and/or metallic, there are conglomerates like a cosmic
   fruitcake, some are self-gravitating piles of rubble.

   Given decades of lead time, using existing technology or technology
   that could be easily developed in 10 years, we could probably divert a
   [29]dino killer. But not by blowing it up or shoving it somehow--that
   could simply turn one dino killer into several thousand [30]meteor
   craters. The more we learn about these fascinating objects, the more we
   appreciate how incredibly fragile they are. Even the so-called solid
   ones are likely to be cracked and fissured into hundreds of shards.
   Some are best described as dust bunnies concealing trainloads of small
   debris. Shove an asteroid or a comet, even a little, and we might be
   back to several thousand meteor craters.

   Astronomers believe the best way to divert an object, whole and in one
   piece, given enough lead time, is an idea called a gravity tractor.
   Planetary astronomer and impact expert [31]Dr. Phil Plait explains:

     A gravity tractor is a way of cajoling a hazardous rock into a safe
     orbit. Instead of landing on the asteroid or pushing it with
     rockets, you put a massive probe near it. The gravity of the probe
     pulls on the asteroid, and you can use that as a "virtual tether".
     The probe has very low thrust rockets that can balance the force of
     gravity, and the net result is a tractor that never has to touch the
     asteroid. This is an incredibly weak force, so it takes a long time
     to nudge the rock into a safe orbit, but if you have a few years
     lead time, this is a very precise and elegant way of saving the
     planet.

   Obviously the resources of every space-faring nation on earth would be
   engaged if we detected a dino-killer-sized object heading our way. Play
   around with this [32]impact simulator and you'll see why: It would be
   the bloody end of civilization as we know it. But the one that hit
   Siberia this week was tiny by those standards, about [33]15 to 20
   meters across. Not only would the gravity tractor work great on
   that--less mass for the tractor to have to attract--there are at least
   two private companies that might be able to do it at little or no cost
   to the U.S. taxpayer.

   [34]Planetary Resources and [35]Deep Space Industries have announced
   big plans for mining asteroids. And they told me the first step in that
   process is finding and determining the exact composition of candidate
   Near Earth Objects. That's not to say that NASA or some other nation's
   space agency couldn't do it alone. In fact NASA or ESA asteroid and
   comet experts would be calling the shots, in much the same way CDC
   specialists might manage commercial production and distribution of a
   vaccine to a new, deadly disease.

   But frankly, if your business is detecting and mining these objects,
   given years of lead time, you damn well better have the specialized
   hardware on hand to detect, analyze, and divert a smallish NEO, even
   one substantially larger than the bad boy that hit Siberia. And if you
   plan on making a profit at this, you ought to be able to do it faster
   and cheaper than an underfunded government agency acting completely
   alone, starting from scratch, which is too often controlled or
   influenced by elected imbeciles who do not "believe in" government,
   along with evolution, thermometers or the Big Bang.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health

   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       I know it wouldn't be easy, but you have such a wonderful platform
       at Daily Kos and your other outlets that gives you a head start
       over most other people when it comes to getting the word out and
       marketing any book you write.
       Even if you don't find a publisher, there's always the Amazon
       Kindle store, Createspace, and other self-publishing venues to
       consider.

 I used createspace and amazon kindle.. ([125]0+ / 0-)
       ...and I would highly recommend them!
       Their self-publishing step by step approach is very easy to
       navigate and quite intuitive.  They allow for republishing and
       re-editing, with only a couple of days' downtime, if you need to
       make changes once you are up and running on amazon.
       As I navigated the process, I kept expecting the next page to be
       the one where the hidden fees have to be paid.  I really expected a
       fat fee for the paperback publishing aspect, but there were none!
       Incredible!  The only fee was a 25. expanded distribution fee,
       which was neither excessive nor hidden (nor required to publish).
       (Even createspace's preformed book covers are pretty nice.)

 asteroids rotate ([139]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [140]antirove

   Every scheme I've heard totally ignores that asteroids rotate.
   Sometimes fast, around an axis that is unknowable in advance.  Tumble
   is another word.

   Trying to attach something to a spinning, tumbling object is
   impossible.

   Laser beams have the problem that they cannot hit the same spot again.
    So the energy is spread out over the surface, with little effect.

   A gravitational attractor might work, but any scheme that ignores the
   asterioid's spin, tumble, angular momentum is
   doomed.

       doesn't attach to the asteroid but just flies along side it
       maintaining a relatively constant distance.  Remember, that soda

 The problem is the energy required, not the spin ([155]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [156]Sneelock

       You don't have to hit the same spot. You don't have to attach
       anything.  For example, nuclear weapons are like hand grenades:
       close counts. F still equals ma.  Laser beams don't have to hit the
       same spot to push the orbit away from the earth. They simply need
       to add momentum in the same direction.
       The problem with any solution is that large amounts of energy are
       required to change the momentum of a large object moving at a high
       speed.

       Isn't that what we are already kinda good at here on Earth with
       nuclear weapons?
       How about a large enough nuclear device exploded near the asteroid
       to nudge it into a safe orbit, but not so close as to explode it
       into dangerous fragments?
       I kind of prefer this route as it would combine brute strength with
       precision aiming and timing, all of which we should be able to
       achieve now or in the near future.
       Obviously it would be preferable to engage the asteroid at a great
       distance from Earth, the farther out the better, just in case we
       need to do another take or go to a Plan B.

       because whenever I think about future astronauts doing things like
       that, I think of a friend of mine, who is about as genetically
       perfect for space travel as humans can be. But this person is
       perfect because she is not a lantern jawed athletic superman, quite
       the opposite.
       She is about 4'2" and weighs like 65 lbs. She grew up in the
       mountains of Ecuador, she's factory equipped with a set of super
       lungs that are acclimated to dry cold thin air, her skin is adapted
       for intense UV, she comes from a culture with a minimalist
       lifestyle, and she happens to come from a group of people with some
       of the longest lifespans on earth. The perfect astronaut-colonist
       is not a superman, it's a teensy-tiny Tibetan or Andean female who
       can live on a quarter of the calories it takes to power my body and
       thrive in low partial pressure, UV rich dry environments that would
       probably weaken or kill superman almost as fast as Kryptonite.

       We only need to slow it's arrival by 7 minutes or so and we'll be
       out of the way when it gets here.
       But my problem is, it seems under current technology, we don't have
       years lead times.  It doesn't do any good to predict a 50% chance
       of hitting.  If we slow that object down by 7 minutes, we might

   which during the Apollo program returned to the public sector about

   of our GDP for part of the 60's until dropping later in that decade).
   The microprocessor chip and a slew of electronic miniaturization may

   Yeah, that's a source of government funding we should be slashing right

   heavy booster platform which could be adapted for deep space asteroid

       Diverting an incoming asteroid is orders of magnitude easier to do
       than establishing a self-sustaining colony on another world.
       In fact, we'll have solved the asteroid problem centuries before
       we're ready to permanently slip the surly bonds of Earth --
       probably within the next few decades, in fact.
       We've already detected an estimated 31% of all asteroids over 100m
       in size (IAU figures) and we've barely even started. We've a long
       way to go yet, especially to find those between 40m and 100m (just
       3% so far) that can still cause serious damage, but the threat of
       an unexpected asteroid strike wiping us out is already receding.
       And I have little doubt that given enough warning, even if we
       detected an inbound monster killer tomorrow, we'd pull together and
       find a way to stop it from hitting.

   someone else will. Let's hope they have a friendly agenda.

   I believe some space based telescopes would be an essential early part
   of a program to specifically look for even small objects coming out of
   the deep solar system. The further away an object is the easier it will
   be to divert it. Only a 5 degree shift could keep a planet killer
   permanently in a safe orbit.

   And for bonus points,  a few centuries hence a big one like that might
   make a nice interstellar generational ship if it can be hollowed out
   and propelled somehow to one of our nearest stellar neighbors.
   Especially if hibernation, artificial biospheres and radical life

   And the answer is, yup, and it would be fairly easy with existing

   slight gravitational tug to pull it onto the right course, and then,

       It takes more h-bombs than we have, to destroy all microbial life
       on earth.  Furthermore, there are tight watches kept on nuclear
       materials and nuclear testing.  And a bomb on a freighter (as Jeff
       describes elsewhere) would target one city and start a war we would
       ultimately win.  They would be destroyed, although we wouldn't
       particularly like losing the city.
       It seems easier to me to send small probes out close to NEO
       asteroids and leave them out there making scientific
       "observations."  The implicit threat wouldn't need to be stated,
       and the effectiveness of the threat wouldn't even have to be
       verifiably real to be of defensive value.
       A good question then is this: If some other country we don't trust,
       like China or Iran or Pakistan, were to begin sending such probes
       up for "scientific" purposes, would we try to prevent it?
       Or, what if some other country we didn't trust were to send up
       alleged asteroid deflection probes with the purpose of PROTECTING

       asteroids, and they all have different orbits with different
       potential impact appointments.  The Chicxalub meteor that wiped out
       the Cretaceous was a whopping  6 miles in diameter, but that's
       actually kind of puny when you think about it, isn't it?  Because
       there are bigger ones out there.  Ones that are bigger that could
       incinerate the planet to molten lava or smaller ones that could
       just wipe out most of a continent, if targeted correctly.
       A much, much smaller asteroid could be tweaked so it doesn't hit
       the continent at all, but, instead, targets the ocean and causes
       massive tidal coastal waves, wiping out major industrial centers on
       the east coast, for example.  A country that is mostly land-locked
       and/or that has no Atlantic coastal presence might face a much
       smaller environmental risk from this.
       It seems to me that as a privatized space industry makes the
       technology for such things off-the-shelf, the cost of R&D for
       implementing such a thing will decline.
       Thinking about this some more, there's also the possibility of some
       country deciding to "mine" the asteroids, for instance by finding
       some metal-heavy asteroid and bringing it back to earth orbit for
       "safe" orbital mining and zero-gravity construction.  I've heard
       plenty of talk about how we need to beat the Chinese to do this if
       we want to maintain our technological and industrial (not military)
       edge in the future.  In this case, we would be essentially turning
       asteroids that AREN'T in close earth orbits into near earth orbits
       for industrial purposes.  We aren't anywhere near that, but it's
       worth considering that if and when we ever do have to consider
       this, that we're also talking about exterminating all life on
       earth.
       Suppose a multinational like Halliburton decided to mine the
       asteroids this way.  Who would tell them not to do it?  The

       You would be telegraphing your punch way in advance by doing so
       because it would take many minutes from pulling the trigger to
       hitting the target, time in which the target may be moving and your
       bullet is moving too fast to adjust.
       It seems to me it would be easier and faster to just use a laser.

 You keep an inventory of weapons in orbit ([448]0+ / 0-)

       It is very difficult to see the de-orbit burn, especially during
       daylight hours.
       Yes, it would be very difficult to hit a moving object. Aircraft
       carriers do not move very fast and maybe just hitting the water
       near it may be enough to sink it.
       The only military laser that I know of with the capabilities that
       you mention was the size of a Boeing 707 and could only be fired
       once without refueling.

 Okay, reality check ([452]2+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [453]Dumbo, [454]Calamity Jean

       Dropping things from orbit is an incredibly stupid weapons systems,
       for several reasons.
       1. It's a system that everyone can see, all the time, and know
       exactly where it is. And if you know where it is, you know what it
       could hit, and when, at any given time.
       2. It's a weapon that everyone and their dog can see coming. You
       can't hide it. If you do a powerful de-orbiting burn, that makes it
       easy to detect and determine it's probable impact point. If you do
       a low power burn to try and make it less noticeable, that means an
       enormous lead time to track separation...and determine the probable
       impact point.
       3. If you're using kinetic energy, that means the object is coming
       in fast, but because it's coming in fast that means it's surrounded
       by a plasma sheathe that prevents communications or sensors from
       adjusting it's course other than what it was programmed. You know
       those few minutes of silence during the Apollo re-entries when they
       lost the data feed and communications? Same thing. Which means for
       the last few minutes of its flight the projectile can't change it's
       target.
       Oh, and that plasma sheathe? Reflects radio waves like you wouldn't
       believe, which means you get a track on it almost immediately.
       At 30 knots (aircraft carrier cruising speeds), an carrier is
       moving over 50 feet a second, which means that if you have a three
       minute blackout window, the carrier will have moved almost two
       miles, or it might have altered course and be somewhere else.
       Basically, it's a stupid ass weapons system.

       It also is terribly expensive in terms of energy.
       We think of "dropping" thigs from orbit. We detach them from our
       satelite and they just drop to Earth. Reallu, anything we detach
       from our satelite will just follow along with it. Verne, wh got so
       much wrong in From the Earth to the Moon, got that right.
       What you have to do to hit simething is fire a braking rocket to
       cut it's velocity to the point that it enters the Earth's
       atmosphere. Then, the atmosphere brakes it further, and that makes
       its trtajectory somewhat unpredictable. Hitting Texas by dropping
       something from orbit woulldn't be hard. Hitting Dallas would take a
       lot of practice. Hitting a single building would be impossible.
       The artillery and rockets we have on Earth are much more practical.

 Hit is much more difficult. ([467]0+ / 0-)

   A hit is much more difficult than a miss.

   A lot of the responses to this seem to think of the Earth as this big
   target.

   The earth is a tiny point in the Solar System. To hit it you have to
   manouvre something into an orbit that comes within 4,000 miles of the
   orbit of Earth.
   If you're not in any hurry, that's enough. It will hit sooner or later,
   maybe in 10,000,000 years. If you want to destroy the earth within the
   next century, then you have to not only have the orbit intersect
   Earth's orbit, you have to have it intersect it at just the right time.

       If we did detect an inbound killer asteroid, it would not

       Think about it -- nothing would concentrate the mind better than an

       NASA and the space industry, and would likely foster a much closer
       working relationship between the major powers as they all faced
       down a common threat.
       Of course, we would have to succeed, but I suspect the prospect of

   Too many issues with this concept to make it actually work. The size of
   the object you would need would have to be pretty large. Too large for
   us to simply put into a high orbit. And putting that aside for a
   moment, the energy output we would have to use to move the large object
   would be equally immense. And that is if we could even change its orbit
   far enough to get into position in time. You might as well put rockets
   on the moon's surface and move it instead!

   This is just not possible given today's rocketry and engineering.

 Explain then... ([626]0+ / 0-)
       How to put a massive enough object into high orbit to have even a
       minor level of gravity to create this tractor? Hmmm? And how much
       fuel would it take to get this object into orbit? We have tons and
       tons of rocket fuel expended already just getting a piece of light
       aluminum into space. Yes, those pesky satellites aren't made of
       iron and steel ya know. They have their weight cut down by the
       ounce so it can achieve orbit and stay there.
       Then you can go about explaining to the rest of the class about how
       to alter the trajectory of your massive gravity tractor from it's
       current orbit which is likely on an equatorial orbit and intercept
       an object coming in over the poles. Hmm? There is a lot of science
       to orbital mechanics and it's not just a simple case of putting
       your massive object into "reverse" and backing it up. It's flying
       at thousands of miles per hour just to maintain itself in orbit.
       Altering that orbit by even a fraction costs a lot of fuel due to
       it's large mass. Then there is the problem of not hitting every one
       of a million other satellites currently in orbit. It's a damn
       traffic jam up there now.
       All in all. It's a cute idea. But far from feasible. We would need
       to make leaps in engine technology far exceeding where we are now
       with solid and liquid rockets. You are talking somewhere beyond
       "nuclear fission" to create the thrust necessary to move something
       like this object. By that time we would be able to fly to Mars in
       less than a week and commute to the Moon.
       We are talking very large leaps.

       Follow the links and let the big brains that spend their life's

       drives is all that's needed to do the trick. BTW, I work with
       satellites and I assure you a payload of a couple tons is routinely
       lifted. Even using very light materials. NASA should be upping the
       ante shortly with a heavy lifter rocket now in development.
       Those with the plan are the ones you want to argue with. And it's
       all using current technology.

 By the way this doesn't happen in orbit ([637]0+ / 0-)
       The tugs are not used around the Earth to 'grab' the object. You go
       out an meet the object on its trajectory as far away as possible.
       If we have the option to do so, we might put it later in an orbit.
       It won't be in a geosynchronous one around the planet. It would be
       further out or perhaps to sit at a Lagrange point or such. Or send
       it away for good if nothing else.

 Interesting... ([641]0+ / 0-)
       But I still have a great many doubts that this would be feasible
       unless we knew the precise trajectory of an incoming object a
       decade ahead of time. And so far I haven't heard of any
       planet-killers predicted. (probably wouldn't be a good idea to make
       that public I suppose)
       But let's say that it can be built, placed into a trajectory to
       intercept and divert the planet killer that is heading our way. Now
       given all that...
       How are we going to convince everyone to fund this large project
       years in advance? We can't even get these guys to agree that
       climate change is real. People in this world are very obstinate
       when it comes to long term problems that aren't tangible. They need
       to be convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt and even then you will
       have the "Jesus will save us" crowd trying to pray away the
       problem. The human race is really a pitiful group. We are our own
       worst enemy.

   The asteroids that we'd really need to deflect are huge.  And we
   wouldn't just have to get our gravity tractor into high orbit.  We'd
   have to maneuver it to where the asteroid is, then change its
   trajectory and get it to track very accurately a path close to the path
   of the target asteroid -- for a long time.  That would take a huge
   amount of energy.

   Seems to me we'd have a better chance trying to blow it up.  If we
   could catch up with it a few years before impact and split it into
   smaller pieces, the odds seem small that all of those would follow the
   exact path that the whole thing would have for several years.

   "but if you have a few years lead time"

   With near space filled with objects waiting to be pulled into the
   Earth's gravity well, there will never be a "few years lead time".  The
   resources you would have to put into tracking EVERY near earth object
   while people are starving on the planet from lack of food would be
   simply unrealistic and inhumane for the probabilities involved.

   It's just simple ballistics: You can't beat the clock when you have a
   ballistic trajectory you are trying to intercept.  It gets there when
   it gets there, not when YOU want it to get there.

   People think we can just instantly teleport something to get it into
   position where it can do the dirty deed on an asteroid to save the
   planet.  But that only happens in the movies.  It can be done, but it
   takes painstaking time and mathematical planning.  The farther out from
   Earth it is, the longer it takes to send something to it.  By the time
   you get to it, it's that much closer.  The closer it is, the less time
   we have to react and plan.  The only way they are able to dock with the
   Space Station is through meticulous planning and again,,, MATHEMATICS.

   This is why Star Wars satellite warfare is fundamentally flawed: unless
   you have something like phasers that can instantly target and fry
   (which we don't), it won't work with our current ballistic based
   weaponry.  The Patriot missile system was a farce, didn't hit any of
   Saddam's scuds, I don't care WHAT you saw on TEE VEE.  By the time you
   spend gazillions on a missile defense system that doesn't work, it
   might just cost less to get hit by the missile that might never get
   fired.

   We don't live in a Star Trek world, folks.  The laws of physics are
   against us.

     With near space filled with objects waiting to be pulled into the
     Earth's gravity well, there will never be a "few years lead time".
       We're talking about actual asteroid orbits, not debris clusters
       just sort of floating there like in Star Wars. It is quite possible
       to know more or less where everything will be many years in the
       future -- the catch is to get enough data to reduce the "more or
       less" to an uncertainty less than the (relatively tiny) size of the
       planet.

   And if we were able to tow an asteroid completely out of our planet's

       are chaotic, as illustrated by a classic physics conundrum called
       the three body problem and we know planets move all over the place
       in other solar systems. We see them in strange places where they
       were unlikely to form sometimes. How exactly this happens is a
       topic of intense research and debate among planetary astronomers
       right now.
       Decay is a slightly different deal, the earth's atmosphere actually
       extends for a thousand or more miles into space but it's incredibly
       tenuous. It's just thick enough that, over time, it can slow an
       object down that's orbiting inside that super thin envelope, which
       causes the object to drop in its orbit, where the atmosphere is
       ever so slightly thicker and slows it down ever so slightly faster,
       etc, and eventually it comes streaking in like skylab.
