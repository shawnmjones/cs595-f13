   Leading Off:

   o MA-Sen: Well, we've certainly reached a state of proper confusion.
   Since Wednesday night, two more polls of the Massachusetts Senate
   special election have emerged, and they each paint a different picture
   from PPP's survey last week. Here are all the results pitting Rep. Ed
   Markey versus businessman Gabriel Gomez in a single chart:
    Pollster    Field Dates   Markey (D)   Gomez (R)   Margin
   [32]MassINC 5/5-6         46           38          8
   [33]Suffolk 5/4-7         52           35          17
   [34]PPP     5/1-2         44           40          4
   That's an awfully wide range of results, though certainly Suffolk's
   looks the most outlier-ish. And it'll be forever tempting to question
   Suffolk's results out of hand, in the wake of polling director David
   Paleologos's epically embarrassing "[35]painted those red" debacle last
   year. But it is worth noting that Suffolk used a very tight screen,
   eliminating "voters who weren't certain to vote or who couldn't name
   when the special general election would be held." Meanwhile, MassINC
   provided two sets of results. Those above include leaners; without
   leaners, Markey had a smaller 41-35 lead. PPP, meanwhile, doesn't push
   leaners at all, and both they and MassINC describe their sample as
   consisting of ordinary "likely" voters.

   So if there is some consistency to these results, it seems like the
   tighter you screen and the more you push, the bigger the lead for
   Markey. That makes a certain amount of sense, since in an election in a
   blue state, you'd typically figure that the smaller the voter pool, the
   more likely it is to contain Democratic partisans (and vice versa in a
   red state). That obviously is not always going to be the case, and
   special candidates (like, say, Scott Brown... or Mark Sanford) can
   change things in unexpected ways. But whatever his flaws, Markey is a
   pretty standard Dem, and Gomez certainly hasn't shown himself to be
   particularly unusual.

   Still, there's a world of difference between a 4 point race and a 17
   point one. Even under PPP's scenario, Markey was still the favorite,
   but I'd certainly rather be over 50 percent rather than well below it.
   All we can really do, though, is wait for more polling to see if a more
   consistent trend emerges.

   Gubernatorial:

   o MI-Gov: It looks like Michigan Democrats [36]are rallying around
   ex-Rep. Mark Schauer as their gubernatorial nominee--including two men
   who might otherwise run themselves. Both ex-Rep. Bart Stupak and
   Michigan Board of Education member John Austin more or less say they
   won't run if Schauer does, sentiments that may be inspired both be a
   desire for unity and a sense that Schauer would be the dominant
   favorite in a Democratic primary. (In a statement emailed later, Stupak
   sounded [37]downright effusive about a Schauer candidacy and really
   seems to be part of Democratic efforts to recruit him into the race.)

   However, [38]the same article notes that State Rep. Vicki Barnett is
   also considering a bid, and she doesn't sound so easily deterred.
   Barnett says she's in regular touch with Schauer, but adds that "it's
   early, I'm pursuing a run and gathering momentum and will continue to
   do so."

   House:

   o CA-31: It seems that attorney Eloise Reyes managed to enter the race
   for California's 31st Congressional District without making much of a
   splash in the press. We wrote about her interest [39]in early April,
   but hadn't heard anything since. And that was despite some major
   upheaval, with ex-Rep. Joe Baca announcing he'd run even though
   establishment Democrats had already coalesced around Redlands Mayor
   Pete Aguilar. None of that deterred Reyes, who joined the fray [40]late
   last month, though you'd be hard pressed to find anything on Google
   News or Nexis. (Thanks to eagle-eyed reader MR for the catch.) That
   makes her the fourth Democrat to get involved, including San Bernardino
   school board member Danny Tillman.

   o FL-26, -13, -09: If you're a regular reader of the Digest, you'll
   have encountered most of the Republican names Abby Livingston cites as
   potential House candidates in Florida next year, though there are a few
   that are new to us. In FL-26, currently held by freshman Dem Rep. Joe
   Garcia, Livingston tacks on the name of state Sen. Rene Garcia as a
   potential candidate. And in FL-13, where octogenarian GOP Rep. Bill
   Young is always a threat to retire, she runs through a list of several
   possible replacements: state Sen. Jack Latvala, former St. Petersburg
   Mayor Rick Baker, and former Pinellas County Commissioner Neil
   Brickfield.

   There's also a little bit of Republican cloud talk about unseating
   another freshman Dem, Alan Grayson in FL-09, but at [41]62-37 Obama,
   that district is virtually out of reach for the GOP, even with
   Grayson's penchant for causing problems for himself. Indeed, the
   president's vote share was higher in the 9th in 2012 versus 2008, even
   as it moved in the opposite direction in Florida as a whole. I think
   Grayson is much more likely to lose a Democratic primary than a general
   election.

   Other Races:

   o LA Mayor: [42]A new poll of the L.A. mayoral race from the Pat Brown
   Institute at Cal State Los Angeles shows City Controller Wendy Greuel
   narrowly edging City Councilman Eric Garcetti, 46-45. That's the second
   poll in a row to show Greuel ahead, following those unexpected
   [43]SurveyUSA numbers that featured a hard-to-believe 12-point
   turnaround that put her up 45-42. One thing we really haven't seen in
   this race is much internal polling, but I'm wondering if either side is
   thinking about releasing any, to either confirm or refute the notion
   that Greuel might have a slight advantage.

   Grab Bag:

   o DCCC: The DCCC has rolled out [44]yet another program-type program,
   this time called "Jumpstart," which seems like a pre-Red to Blue
   listing (and another excuse to send out a press release). None of the
   eight names on it are surprising, except perhaps that of Michael
   Eggman, a bee farmer who recently announced he'd run against GOP Rep.
   Jeff Denham in CA-10. Eggman has kind of a Some Dude profile, though
   his sister is Assemblywoman Susan Eggman. (Last year's nominee,
   astronaut Jose Hernandez, is [45]still considering a rematch.)

   Redlands Mayor Pete Aguilar is also on the list, but that's not really
   a surprise, since the DCCC has made it amply clear they prefer him to
   ex-Rep. Joe Baca, and, I guess, to attorney Eloise Reyes, who recently
   joined the race. (See our CA-31 bullet above.)

   o Massachusetts: Not a whole lot doing in PPP's [46]Massachusetts
   miscellany, though freshman Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren starts off
   with a 44-39 job approval rating.

   o PA Redistricting: In the wake of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's
   ruling that upheld the legislature's most recent maps for the state
   House and Senate, Keegan Gibson takes a look at how the new lines might
   [47]mash together various incumbents. Most involve various Dem-on-Dem
   matchups, though a couple of seats could feature one Republican and one
   Democratic lawmaker duking it out.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [98]Civil
   Rights, [99]Community, [100]Congress, [101]Culture, [102]Economy,
   [103]Education, [104]Elections, [105]Energy, [106]Environment,

   [112]Meta, [113]National Security, [114]Science, [115]Transportation,
   or [116]White House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider
   adding the state ([117]California, [118]Texas, etc). Keep in mind,
   though, that there are many wonderful and important diaries that don't
   fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Markey is certainly the more well-known candidate, so if pushed,
       one would expect the leaners to move in his direction.
       Unfortunately, what it tells me is that a large swath of the MA
       electorate is open to [DEL: Brown :DEL] Gomez.  We have work to do.

       Whatever the hell happened to the MA electorate that let Scott
       Brown in the door cannot be allowed to happen again.
       Can I ask, in your opinion, what was it that led to Brown's
       election?  Was it just an abysmal campaign by Coakley or something
       else?

       A lot of people were upset about healthcare and Brown was
       campaigning that he was the vote that would stop it. Tons of
       outside help, plus Coakey was a terrible candidate.
       It won't happen again short of democrats staying home.
       I agree with xgoper that Markey needs to campaign against the GOP
       as much as Gomez.

 A perfect storm in January, 2010 ([165]6+ / 0-)

       A lot of things went wrong.  Coakley's non-campaign, Brown's
       aggressive campaign, the unpopular (fairly or not) healthcare law
       being the issue of the day,  the right riled up by it, the center
       turning against it, the left demoralized by the death of the public
       option, the Tea Party on the ascent at the time and flush with
       political confidence after flexing muscle in the NJ and VA
       governors races, Obama entering the "first term slog" portion of
       his presidency, low turnout, Democratic overconfidence and, lastly,
       a feeling of flailing away desperation (or, in other words, a
       serious loser meme) painting Coakley at the end.
       Having said that, we need to run like heck this time around even
       though the backdrop is completely different.

   I don't see Ed Markey losing. While he hasn't been enthusiastic as a

   vacation, refusing to shake hands outside the "Gahden" and call Tim

 It is - Gomez may take Catholic vote ([203]0+ / 0-)

   which is particularly large in MA.    On the other hand, MA has a large
   religious group in it's Unitarian Universalists which is progressive.
   The religious groups are simply one part of the equation and worth

 Agreed ([213]0+ / 0-)
       The "Catholic vote" in Massachusetts is hardly monolithic. Gomez
       being more moderate on social issues doesn't make him a good refuge
       for true social conservatives. I'd expect most, but not all, Steve
       Lynch voters to support Markey in the end. The unions that
       supported Lynch, and Lynch himself, have rallied behind Markey.
       Most people have no idea of Gomez's policy views yet. Gomez's tax
       deduction issue, and bin Laden stuff, and private equity deals may
       well prevent undecideds from coming his way. The polls, tight as
       they are, show most undecideds are people whose views on the issues
       would lead them to Markey (e.g. they like Obama, don't want GOP to
       control the Senate, etc.).

 I think Gonzales' tax scam is going to sink him ([222]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   He took a $281,500 tax deduction in 2005 for donating his right to
   change the exterior of his historic house to an architectural
   preservation society. However, he didn't have the right to make
   exterior changes - they were already forbidden by law before he bought
   the house.

   The house's value when he bought it was based on its historic status
   and the restrictions that came therewith. Basically, he was
   double-dipping, fraudulently "donating" a right he did not have.

   General, and the entire House of Delegates), but if so, there was a big
   rally for Terry McAuliffe yesterday in Arlington, VA.  [237]See here

       Still haven't seen him down here in Hampton Roads.  Meanwhile the
       VA Pilot is crapping on him about his business record, with the
       latest story on how the wood pellet manufacturing that was supposed
       to go into the old Franklin paper mill still has nothing to show
       for itself.
       They are crapping on Cucinelli as well, especially over his stupid
       tax plan.  But in the end, I fear that McAuliffe needs to do a lot
       more in an off-year election cycle to get out the vote in areas
       outside northern Virginia.

 the good news for Markey is... ([253]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [254]abgin, [255]radical simplicity, [256]fenway49

   ...regardless of which poll you want to use, they all show him ahead.
   And the average of all of these polls in recent days shows a Markey
   lead of 8.75.

   Of course, lots of things can change in a month and there's no room for
   complacency.

   Markey is still trying to become better known to most voters, since he
   hasn't run for a statewide election before the recent statewide primary
   election for the Senate seat.

   If he continues to try to consolidate his liberal base and starts
   chipping away at independent and undecided voters, he should be in good
   shape.

 there are six weeks left ([259]0+ / 0-)
       and Markey's primary ads were flat and emotionless.
       I worry that Steve Lynch voters will be more likely to go "moderate
       Republicon" than vote for Markey who is one of the most progressive
       members of Congress

   Even if you average them it's about a 9 point race which isnwhere I

 Probability error rears its ugly head ([272]0+ / 0-)

   These are all polls with around 4% +/- sampling error and a 5%
   probability of an outlier that exceeds this.  So if Markey is up 10
   points (I pulled that number out of the air, it's just the average of
   all the polls), any random poll will fall between 6-14 points 95% of
   the time.    (This is simplifying the mathematics, but I need my hard
   core quant skills for work this morning.)

   Add to that the different sampling methodologies and this says that we
   need more polling.  For example, after PPP has done 10 polls, we'll get
   a better idea.

 Ed Markey is in the news on a few issues ([275]0+ / 0-)

   Henry Melcher at Up! on MSNBC got all snarky about Markey talking about
   his work on enabling the Internet.

   [276]Ed Markey attempts youth appeal by touting legislation from the
   mid-90s

   and then

   [277]Ed Markey Runs Against Obama's Proposed Social Security Cut

   Yay!

   There is also a little campaign news.

   [278]Gov. Deval Patrick to rally with Senate candidate Ed Markey

   [279]Massachusetts AFL-CIO endorses Democrat Ed Markey in Senate
   special election

   The news on Gabriel Gomez is mostly about his IRS "Dirty Dozen" tax
   fraud problem (taking a deduction on a promise not to alter a historic
   home where the law already forbade such alterations).

   [280]Gomez took $281,500 home tax deduction

   This is the only other item I found in a quick search in Google News.

   [281]Gabriel Gomez: `Sanford seems pathetic'

   This is in no way a scientific comparison, but I would take Markey's
   news over Gomez's any day.
