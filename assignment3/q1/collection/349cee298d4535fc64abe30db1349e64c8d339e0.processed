   Janet Napolitano
   [29]L.A. Times:

     Janet Napolitano, the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security and former
     governor of Arizona, is being named as the next president of the
     University of California system, in an unusual choice that brings a
     national-level politician to a position usually held by an academic,
     the Times has learned. Her appointment also means the 10-campus
     system will be headed by a woman for the first time in its 145-year
     history.

   The current president of the University of California, Mark G. Yudof,
   will step down in late August, according to the report. Napolitano is
   expected to take the post in September.

   [30]7:42 AM PT: [31]Statement from Napolitano:

     "For more than four years I have had the privilege of serving
     President Obama and his Administration as the Secretary of Homeland
     Security. The opportunity to work with the dedicated men and women
     of the Department of Homeland Security, who serve on the frontlines
     of our nation's efforts to protect our communities and families from
     harm, has been the highlight of my professional career. We have
     worked together to minimize threats of all kinds to the American
     public. The Department has improved the safety of travelers;
     implemented smart steps that make our immigration system more fair
     and focused while deploying record resources to protect our nation's
     borders; worked with states to build resiliency and make our
     nation's emergency and disaster response capabilities more robust;
     and partnered with the private sector to improve our cybersecurity.
     After four plus years of focusing on these challenges, I will be
     nominated as the next President of the University of California to
     play a role in educating our nation's next generation of leaders. I
     thank President Obama for the chance to serve our nation during this
     important chapter in our history, and I know the Department of
     Homeland Security will continue to perform its important duties with
     the honor and focus that the American public expects."

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 That myth has been well-punctured ([130]0+ / 0-)
       Google on "college sports lose money" and you can have your choice
       of articles on how 90 percent or so of colleges lose money on their
       sports programs. They don't generate money themselves and big
       donors find all kinds of reasons to donate.
       The University of Chicago, to name one, dumped bigtime football in
       the thirties and suffered not at all. The last I checked Boston
       University still exists. (Football is now a [131]club sport like
       ultimate frisbee.) I'm not sure why schools which can't break even
       - with players who are essentially unpaid interns - cling to this
       myth.

   If I remember correctly, my tuition was about $325 a semester, for a
   full load of 15 credits.  Today you pay about twice that for ONE class.

   We're financially killing and eating our own young before they even get
   started.  Our parents recognized how important a college education was
   to the next generation and they pooled resources to make sure that we
   could get a good start on our adult lives.  Somehow our generation
   decided its too much to do the same for our own kids.

   They certainly deserve it.  Massive unrest over fees and tuition.  I
   graduated from UC Berkeley in 1965, got a masters from same in '66.
   Cost then was about $100 a semester, no tuition.  Just living expenses.
    Even when I got a law degree in 1977 it was about $350 a semester.

   Of course there has been massive inflation since then, but still.  In
   the late  1960s the conservatives took revenge on student protestors by
   consistently cutting the state share going to higher education.  Then
   by raising fees and instituting tuition, then raising tuition.  They
   decided grads of professional schools would make so much they could
   finance the huge loans that became necessary.

   Then the Silicon Valley zillionaires, many of whom had graduated from
   UC campuses, decided it was better to save money on taxes and hire
   cheaper foreign workers rather than pay taxes to fund higher education.
   And even K-12.

   California went from being the crown jewel of public education, an
   example for the world, to a state filled with selfish older white
   people and younger, striving minorities, plus the Cyberselfish who
   despoil the coast to give themselves $6 million weddings but won't pay
   taxes for the infrastructure that made them rich.

   Golden State--but for me, not for thee.

   Seriously, she was a competent governor of Arizona, but her background
   is in law enforcement and anti-terror stuff.  They really need someone
   there who understands how NOT to treat protesters, but given DHS'
   involvement in putting down Occupy,  I really have a bad feeling about
   this.  I hope I'm wrong.

       This is all about hiring a super heavy hitter who can go
       head-to-head with the governor and legislature to secure resources,
       or go head-to-head with the faculty and administration to
       streamline budgets.  It has nothing to do with her anti-terror or

       As a CA tax payer I am pissed. She has zero qualifications for the
       position and I think it shows absolute contempt for the mission of
       the UC system to appoint her as if all highly accomplished people
       are interchangeable, irregardless of where their actual expertise
       lies. It is also worth noting that she had  also had nothing to

       I was hoping she would return and run for the senate, but in truth
       she may not have won anyway, she burned bridges here, and is not as
       popular as she once was. She is probably wise to high-tail it to
       California and stay away from the state she abandoned.

   But then why did they have to insist on anonymity?  I think the

       when there was literally no reason to block them other than "we

       Made a lot of noise filibustering for a while? Certainly. "Blocked"
       in the sense of refusing to confirm? Not very likely, IMO. But
       using hearings/Senate debate for loud, well-covered
       Administration-bashing? SOP for the GOP.

       FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
       Friday, July 12, 2013
       University of California Office of the President

     Robert Powell, chair of UC's systemwide Academic Senate and a
     faculty representative on the Board of Regents, praised the choice:
     "In my discussions with her, Secretary Napolitano clearly
     articulated the view that the University of California must do all
     it can to ensure not only that it remains the greatest public
     university in the world in the 21st century, but also that it moves
     to new heights.

     "She has deep respect for the faculty, and she will listen to what
     we say. She knows that, as the core of what makes UC great, the
     faculty must have an environment in which they can thrive as
     scholars and teachers."

     Napolitano was named one of the top five governors in the country by
     Time magazine. As the first woman to chair the National Governors
     Association, she launched the "Innovation America" initiative to
     align K-12 and higher education curricula to better prepare students
     for a global economy and strengthen the nation's competitiveness by
     improving its capacity to innovate.

     At the Department of Homeland Security, she has championed
     cutting-edge research and development, investing more than $2.2
     billion in state-of-the-art solutions at national labs and
     universities across the country to protect people and critical
     infrastructure.
     Under her leadership, Homeland Security also has strengthened its
     outreach efforts to academic institutions through the establishment
     of the Office of Academic Engagement, and she created the Homeland
     Security Academic Advisory Council, involving leadership from more
     than 20 universities and colleges around the country.
     She has repeatedly testified about the need for comprehensive
     immigration reform and, earlier this year, she served as the
     Administration's sole witness in the Senate Judiciary Committee's
     hearing on the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill.  She
     also testified before the Senate in support of the Dream Act and
     defended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals process in a
     hearing before the House Judiciary Committee.

   We (in education) are fighting for the continued existence of a system

       But this post is more a political position than an academic one;
       she is not the Prez of a University.
       Their budget is $20 billion with a b annually. Having someone who
       has run a state and a Cabinet branch is experience that could be
       useful in this office.
       With that said, there is no way to know at this point is she will
       be a good fit for the job.
       Many of the comments focus on her ties to the NSA scandal, etc, and
       those are the ones that smack of CT. The UC system is still the
       best public university system in the world, and this choice does
       not relegate it to the Orwellian scrap heap like so many falling
       sky comments suggest.

   As a Californian, this is very discouraging.  Napolitano has been a
   disaster at Fatherland Security.  The TSAholes have been given ever
   great budget and powers while delivering only security theater and
   population compliance indoctrination.  What they do has little if
   anything to do with actual security.

   On nearly every front, Fatherland Security is a department that main
   mission is to undermine civil liberties and inculcate obedience.

   What was the mantra when there was a real security threat?   We have
   nothing to fear, but fear itself!

   Today, not so much.

   Napolitano's move is another example of how incompetence  and sticking
   to the program result in advancement.

   Sickening.

   Does that mean that the huge super-agency model was a failure and a

       Large university systems need educators to lead them.  You can hire
       technical staff to run the bureaucracy.  Top level admin is not
       really hard, have people come into your office and you sign things
       they have done.  Problem is, we keep hiring people that only have
       admin skill and do not have a clue about what they are running or
       how the job is really done.
       I think the university system should be run by someone who has
       committed their life to the university system.  Not some 'admin
       expert' who will cut the wrong programs for the wrong reason
       because they have no institutional history.
       The US does have a history of handing plum university leadership
       roles to politicians.  It has always been a bad idea because it is
       just patronage for the political class.

 Nuke time ASAP! ([915]0+ / 0-)

   I guess Harry Reid and others had some sort of inkling that an
   executive vacancy would be occurring soon. Dems sure could start with
   the nuclear option here after the the ugly Hagel DOD filibuster the GOP
   employed and their filibuster threats of Susan Rice torpedoed her at
   State. However, Reid and Co. must finally have the gumption to use the
   nuke option on judicial appointments as well. According to Jeffrey
   Toobin's view of Obama,  ("The Oath"), he believes in progress via
   Congress not the courts. However, if Congress blocks progressive
   measures with Boehner's House, because our voters didn't show up in
   2010, and because  Sen. "McTurtle" wants to filibuster everything, it
   is time to use the nukes for change. Let's get Senators Warren, Sherrod
   Brown, and soon-to-be sworn in Markey to push for the nuke option. If
   we don't act now, the GOP will point to a dysfunctional Senate in 2014,
   take it over, and then go nuke on Dems. We have the power, let's use
   it. For more on judicial vacancies and the lessons of Markey's victory,

   Under Napolitano the Department of Homeland Security has become  a
   major force for totalitarian control in our country.  It has
   militarized police departments throughout the country, become a conduit
   for corporate profiteering in a time when human services are
   continually threatened.  They have subjected all Americans to radiation
   without allowing any public comment or oversight.
   There is no transparency or debate as this militarization has been
   accomplished in secrecy, and as it turns out, it has been coordinating
   regional control for the suppression of
   peaceful demonstrations against corruption in government.
   I mean that must be perfect for the University of California system.
