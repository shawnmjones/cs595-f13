"Hubris": New Documentary Reexamines the Iraq War "Hoax"

An MSNBC film, hosted by Rachel Maddow and based on Michael Isikoff and David
Corn's book, finds new evidence that Bush scammed the nation into war.

   [30]MSNBC

   A decade ago, on March 19, 2003, President George W. Bush launched the
   invasion of Iraq that would lead to a nine-year war resulting in 4,486
   dead American troops, 32,226 service members wounded, and over 100,000
   dead Iraqi civilians. The tab for the war topped $3 trillion. Bush did
   succeed in removing Saddam Hussein, but it turned out there were no
   weapons of mass destruction and no significant operational ties between
   Saddam's regime and Al Qaeda. That is, the two main assertions used by
   Bush and his crew to justify the war were not true. Three years after
   the war began, Michael Isikoff, then an investigative reporter for
   Newsweek (he's since moved to NBC News), and I published [31]Hubris:
   The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War, a
   behind-the-scenes account of how Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and
   their lieutenants deployed false claims, iffy intelligence, and
   unsupported hyperbole to win popular backing for the invasion.

   Our book--hailed by the New York Times as "the most comprehensive
   account of the White House's political machinations"--was the first cut
   at an important topic: how a president had swindled the nation into war
   with a deliberate effort to hype the threat. The book is now the basis
   for an [32]MSNBC documentary of the same name that marks the 10th
   anniversary of the Iraq war. Hosted by [33]Rachel Maddow, the film
   premieres Monday night in her usual time slot (9PM ET/PT). But the
   documentary goes beyond what Isikoff and I covered in Hubris,
   presenting new scoops and showing that the complete story of the
   selling of that war has yet to be told.

   One chilling moment in the film comes in an interview with retired
   General Anthony Zinni, a former commander in chief of US Central
   Command. In August 2002, the Bush-Cheney administration opened its
   propaganda campaign for war with a Cheney speech at the annual Veterans
   of Foreign Wars convention. The veep made a stark declaration: "There
   is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.
   There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends,
   against our allies, and against us." No doubt, he proclaimed, Saddam
   was arming himself with WMD in preparation for attacking the United
   States.

   Zinni was sitting on the stage during the speech, and in the
   documentary he recalls his reaction:

     It was a shock. It was a total shock. I couldn't believe the vice
     president was saying this, you know? In doing work with the CIA on
     Iraq WMD, through all the briefings I heard at Langley, I never saw
     one piece of credible evidence that there was an ongoing program.
     And that's when I began to believe they're getting serious about
     this. They wanna go into Iraq.

   That Zinni quote should almost end the debate on whether the
   Bush-Cheney administration purposefully guided the nation into war with
   misinformation and disinformation.

   But there's more. So much more. The film highlights a Pentagon document
   declassified two years ago. This [35]memo notes that in November
   2001--shortly after the 9/11 attacks--Secretary of Defense Donald
   Rumsfeld met with General Tommy Franks to review plans for the
   "decapitation" of the Iraqi government. The two men reviewed how a war
   against Saddam could be triggered; that list included a "dispute over
   WMD inspections." It's evidence that the administration was seeking a
   pretense for war.

   The yellowcake uranium supposedly bought by Saddam in Niger, the
   aluminum tubes supposedly used to process uranium into weapons-grade
   material, the supposed connection between Saddam and Osama bin
   Laden--the documentary features intelligence analysts and experts who
   at the time were saying and warning that the intelligence on these
   topics was wrong or uncertain. Yet administration officials kept using
   lousy and inconclusive intelligence to push the case for war.

   Through the months-long run-up to the invasion, Colin Powell, then the
   secretary of state, would become the administration's No. 1 pitchman
   for the war with a high-profile speech at the UN, which contained
   numerous false statements about Iraq and WMD. But, the documentary
   notes, he was hiding from the public his deep skepticism. In the film,
   Lawrence Wilkerson, Powell's chief of staff at the time, recalls the
   day Congress passed a resolution authorizing Bush to attack Iraq:

     Powell walked into my office and without so much as a
     fare-thee-well, he walked over to the window and he said, "I wonder
     what'll happen when we put 500,000 troops into Iraq and comb the
     country from one end to the other and find nothing?" And he turned
     around and walked back in his office. And I--I wrote that down on my
     calendar--as close for--to verbatim as I could, because I thought
     that was a profound statement coming from the secretary of state,
     former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.

   Wilkerson also notes that Powell had no idea about the veracity of the
   intelligence he cited during that UN speech: "Though neither Powell nor
   anyone else from the State Department team intentionally lied, we did
   participate in a hoax."

   A hoax. That's what it was. Yet Bush and Cheney went on to win
   reelection, and many of their accomplices in this swindle never were
   fully held accountable. In the years after the WMD scam became
   apparent, there certainly was a rise in public skepticism and media
   scrutiny of government claims. Still, could something like this happen
   again? Maddow remarks, "If what we went through 10 years ago did not
   change us as a nation--if we do not understand what happened and adapt
   to resist it--then history says we are doomed to repeat it."
