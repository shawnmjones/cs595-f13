[22]Plamegate: When Woodward was not worried about threats from the
White House

   Bob Woodward's "I'm doing it for the kids" rationale for his
   interpretation of Gene Sperling's email as an attempt to chill his
   reporting is an about face from his previous posture when a White House
   engaged in real retaliation against any person who bucked the White
   House line. Specifically, in 2005 Woodward defended the Bush White
   House in extraordinary terms when they outed a covert CIA agent,
   Valerie Plame. See [30]Why Is Bob Woodward Intent On Destroying His
   Reputation? and [31]Woodward's Descent.

   One of the interesting reactions to Woodward's defense of retaliation
   by the White House against Joe Wilson came from his Watergate reporting
   partner Carl Bernstein, as reported by [32]Arianna Huffington:

     I called Carl Bernstein to ask what he thought of his old partner's
     behavior. He was loyal as ever but he did say something very
     revealing -- and unintentionally damning. "This investigation," he
     told me, "has cast a constant searchlight that the White House can't
     turn off the way it has succeeded in turning off the press. So their
     methodology and their dishonesty and their disingenuousness --
     particularly about how we went to war -- as well as their
     willingness to attack and rough up people who don't agree with them
     are now there for all to see. They can't turn off this searchlight,
     which is shining on a White House that runs a media apparatus so
     sophisticated in discrediting its critics it makes the Haldeman,
     Ehrlichman, Ziegler press shop look like a small-time operation."
     And these are the very thugs that Woodward was protecting while
     attacking the guy operating the searchlight. [Emphasis supplied.]

   It could be that Bob Woodward only cares now because he was the one
   getting pushback from the Obama White House (after all, why would the
   Bush Administration push back against Woodward? He was fawning in his
   coverage of the Bush Administration on Iraq prior to 2005--see, e.g.,
   [33]Bush at War ("[Woodward] is not analytical or critical, a skeptic
   of any sort or a questioner of any depth, and context is a concept as
   foreign to him as foreign policy. He only conveys an image the
   'principals' on the inside, as Woodward loves to call them, want to
   reveal.")

   Or it could be that he defended the Bush Administration on PlameGate
   because he was [34]part of the scandal:

     Bob Woodward apologized to The Washington Post yesterday for failing
     to reveal for more than two years that a senior Bush administration
     official had told him about CIA operative Valerie Plame, even as an
     investigation of who disclosed her identity mushroomed into a
     national scandal.

   Woodward not only did not reveal it to his editors, he failed to reveal
   it when he was calling Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald a
   "junkyard dog" for pursuing the investigation:

     WOODWARD: . . .Now there are a couple of things that I think are
     true. First of all this began not as somebody launching a smear
     campaign that it actually -- when the story comes out I'm quite
     confident we're going to find out that it started kind of as gossip,
     as chatter and that somebody learned that Joe Wilson's wife had
     worked at the CIA and helped him get this job going to Niger to see
     if there was an Iraq/Niger uranium deal.

   Woodward's apologia for a White House engaging, not in threats of
   retaliation, but in fact engaging in actual retaliation against Joe
   Wilson and his wife Valerie Plame, was despicable in any context. In
   the context of his own undisclosed conflict of interest at the time, it
   became even more despicable.

   The fact that Gene Sperling did not threaten, or even hint at
   retaliation, against Bob Woodward, makes Woodward's current dog and
   pony show, especially his appearance on the odious Sean Hannity's show,
   even more despicable.

   The fact that Bob Woodward attempted to [35]"chill" the reporting of
   his [36]former researcher, [37]Jeff Himmelman, demonstrates his skills
   at hypocrisy:

     "I've known this young man for some years now," Ben [Bradlee] said,
     meaning me, "and I trust his skills and his intent." Then he looked
     down at the transcript and said, "Nothing in here really bothers me,
     but I know there's something in here that bothers you. What's in
     here that bothers you?"

     Bob [Woodward] went into his pitch, which he proceeded to repeat
     over the course of the meeting. [...]  Bob tried everything he could
     to get Ben to disavow what he had said, or at least tell me I
     couldn't use it. Ben wouldn't do either of those things. "Bob,
     you've made your point," Ben said after Bob had made his pitch four
     or five times. "Quit while you're ahead."

     Bob turned to me. I had worked for him; he had given an impromptu
     toast at my wedding. You know me and the world we live in, he said.
     People who didn't like him and didn't like the Post--the "fuckers
     out there," as Ben had called them--were going to seize on these
     comments. "Don't give fodder to the fuckers," Bob said, and once he
     lit on this phrase he repeated it a couple of times. The quotes from
     the interview with Barbara were nothing more than outtakes from
     Ben's book, he said. Ben hadn't used them, and so I shouldn't use
     them, either.

     That argument didn't make sense, and I said so. Bob told me it was
     his "strong recommendation" that I not use the quotes, then that it
     was his "emphatic recommendation." Then, when that got no truck:
     "Don't use the quotes, Jeff."

   The last person who can now come and lecture about chilling "the kids"
   is Bob Woodward. He has no credibility to do so.

   What's left to say about him? He did one great thing as a reporter
   (with Carl Bernstein)--Watergate. Since then, his work has been below
   hack level. But hacks in the Beltway press corps are a dime a dozen.
   That's not remarkable.

   What is remarkable is the lengths Bob Woodward will go to try and
   maintain relevance.

   And he has succeeded. We now see what happens to a reporter with no
   scruples and no respect for the truth--he ends up on Sean Hannity's
   show defending his indefensible behavior as being "for the kids."

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   He was a young relatively unknown republican reporter when he and
   Bernstein broke the Watergate stories. If he had been a well known
   comfortably established National figure with White House connections
   back in the 70s he would have covered for Nixon too.

   took office and doubled it after I left. We simply can't afford to

   After years of being a steady GOP lickspittle his father was handed the
   job as Chief Judge of the blood red DuPage County Court system.  Back
   then that was an appointed position, and nobody got appointed to even
   the lowest traffic court job without sucking major GOP dick.  Woodward
   grew up in Wheaton, home of the Billy Graham Institute, and Wheaton
   College.  Woodward had his father's GOP contact list in hand when he
   was in High School, and used it to avoid Viet Nam (got into Yale as a
   Navy ROTC draft dodger who used more of his old man's contacts to
   ingrain himself into the white bread and mayo clowns who all ended up
   in the Nixon administration while he was there).

   His entire Watergate "reporting" was basically repeating things he was
   told "off record".

   He never grew out of that habit.

       the blue light special that cast Woodward as anything other than an
       embedded functionary of TPTB. The truth of it was that Nixon's
       stupid descent into black bag jobs and third-rate burglary was no
       really big deal in DC politics. It was just a handy 'gotcha' that
       could be used to take him down.
       IOW, the reason Richard Nixon needed to be taken down had nothing
       to do with Watergate. Watergate was just the means to that end.
       Woodward played his specified role in that project, which was the
       brainchild of the [536]Joint Chiefs. For the Watergate project Felt
       played his designated role as well.

     This document shows the cut known as the Superlative CPI, and the
     proposal to raise Medicare premiums for some folks (approximately
     the top 25% earners), called 'means testing' Medicare.
       Yes, Woodward's a has-been, and is probably acting in a

     It's about the American People, and our livelihoods and best

       [And I have a strong concern that if we allow the Chained or
       Superlative CPI to be enacted, there will be millions and millions

       ... Armitage inadvertantly mentions Plame to Novak who passed it
       along to a criminal enterprise.
       And Armitage is the sole blame?
       Plame was a NOC; she was investigating the very same weapons
       transfers that BushCo was lying about.
       I hope enough history is remembered so that it is recalled that a
       former agent wrote a book in the 80's and named other agents. A law
       was passed so that would be a crime.
       Armitage admitted his mistake.
       BushCo used it to further their criminal enterprise.

       For the sake of argument, I'll stipulate that it's possible to out
       somebody who showed up at Langley on a regular basis.
       That done, we have this question:
       When Armitage told Novak that Plame worked for the CIA, did he also
       say that she was presently an undercover operative and that
       information was secret?
       If he didn't do that, and there is no record that he did, why would
       Novak assume that the information was classified?
       You're absolutely right that passing it on to Cheney was an
       unfriendly act, but it wasn't a criminal act.  The leaker was
       Armitage. If there's a criminal, he's the one.
       Ditto for Cheney.  Nasty? Sure. Criminal? No.
       The only criminal charge that stuck from that affair was little
       Scooter's lying.

 Remembering that you use "debunk" to mean ([776]0+ / 0-)

   disagreed with.

   I was in court the other day as a pro-se defendant.  Prior to the
   trial, the plaintiff's lawyer called me out into the hallway and urged
   me to settle.  He thoroughly debunked my position and made clear how
   commanding his case was.

   I decided that I would rather hear that assessment from the judge -- an
   impartial 3rd party.

   Thoroughly debunked as my case was, that darned judge on letting the
   law and the facts prevail.

   We won.

   He appears to be tied up in a monkey's fist over his credibility as a
   "real reporter" after the Iraq debacle. Because the Bush people were
   thugs and violent manipulators, maybe on the same scale that the Nixon
   people were, or worse, he sided with them out of fear he would be
   intimidated, and now, he assumes that Obama runs a similar operation,
   because, well, that is what Presidents DO, in Bob Woodward's world. He
   cannot seem to wrap his mind around the idea that this President has
   learned the lesson of Nixon-Reagan-Bush-Clinton-Bush that manipulation
   and intimidation of the press does NOT WORK, but that PERSUASION and
   stating the demonstrable truth of situations does work, in the end.

   Wake up Bob. This is the President you were always hoping for who would
   restore the credibility of the office by refusing to stoop to
   Nixononian and Atwater-inspired lies, manpulations, dogwhistles,
   thuggery and semantic tricks. The media needs to wake up after their 40

       I would hate to think his reporting about the abuses of power in

       administrations, and part of a desire to have that influence for
       himself, but power does corrupt.
       It is possible that this was not his original intent, but possibly
       his security blanket over the years to maintain attention on his
       own infuence. It has happened before.
        If so, we can only hope that Mr. Woodward will see for himself
       that simply kowtowing to power is NOT in the reporter's job
       description if that reporter has ambitions to rise to the stature

   Keep in mind that Woodward already should have been relegated to near
   crackpot status long before he defended leaking Plame's name. I say
   near crackpot because the revelation that indeed there actually was a
   Deep Throat and not a composite as I previously believed prior to Mark
   Felt announcing that he was the source. That information maintained a
   pubic hair's worth of credibility for Woodward before Plame.

   Why do I think Woodward had so little credibility as a journalist? Two
   things in the 1980's come to mind: Janet Cooke returned Pullitzer Prize
   after her story turned out to be fake, and the alleged deathbed
   confession of William Casey.

   Ironically, the final season of The Wire, dealt with a Janet Cooke-ish
   plot where a reporter knows that there really isn't a serial killer but
   he writes about it and wins an award. It is based on reporter Janet
   Cooke's series of stories about an 8 year old heroin addict named
   [1289]Jimmy.  The problem was Jimmy didn't exist. After the stories
   ran, DC officials tried to locate Jimmy, and in doing so, exposed the
   hoax.

   What was Woodward's role in this? He was assistant managing editor so
   he was right in the middle of the controversy. Why do I say that? I
   worked in the business for 15 years and still contribute to my local
   paper.

   Here is my guess of how I know Woodward knew it was a fake. Once Cooke
   runs one story about an eight year old addict, at minimum the newspaper
   would have wanted  to take a picture. As soon as Cooke started hemming
   and hawing and either wouldn't let them come or if they did they would
   never find Jimmy, people would get suspicious awful soon.

   As for  Casey, an agent who guarded him in the hospital, said their was
   [1290]no deathbed confession to Woodward. It never happened.

   So, IMO, long before being in the middle of the Valerie Plame scandal,
   Woodward was a combination of Suzanne Summers and John McCain. He was
   living off one thing he did more than 30 years earlier and while he had
   no credibility whatsoever he was still be used as a DC Village Idiot
   Pundit.

   which he got a lot of after he became famous a while ago, but which
   likely has waned, especially if he got more of it during Bush's 8 than
   he's getting with Obama's.

   He likely doesn't like the waning part and is motivated more by his
   name under a book title than he is reporting.  Bob whines when it
   wanes.

   These days he's getting notoriety as a hack in bigger doses than
   accolades as a journalist.  He once made a pretty good journalist but
   he's going to be remembered as a self-serving hack.

   [1318]wringer. Back in the day the White House really did threaten
   reporters, and publishers...

     ...The thugs who ran the Nixon White House loved to stick it to
     their enemies... documented in a memo by Nixon Special Counsel
     Charles Colson that was released last month by the Nixon
     Presidential Library and Museum.

     ...In summer 1972, as the Washington Post duo of Carl Bernstein and
     Bob Woodward were investigating the Watergate break-in and related
     stories, they learned of a "secret fund" connected to the Committee
     to Re-Elect the President that was controlled by Attorney General
     John Mitchell and several others.

     The fund was to be used for the gathering of information about the
     Democrats...Mitchell went ape when Bernstein called him to discuss
     his findings.

     Katharine Graham, who was publisher of the Post at the time, writes
     of the Bernstein-Mitchell conversation in her 1997 memoir, Personal
     History:

     Mitchell exploded with an exclamation of "JEEEEEEESUS," so violent
     that Carl felt it was "some sort of primal scream" and thought
     Mitchell might die on the telephone. After he'd read him the first
     two paragraphs, Mitchell interrupted, still screaming, "All that
     crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. Katie
     Graham ... is gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if
     that's published."

   As Woodward also knows, [1319]an Enemies List which included journalist
   Daniel Shorr.

   That, Mr. Woodward, is what real threats & intimidation look like.

   If Woodward were actually a credible, objective, non-partisan
   journalist, instead of a burned-out hack, apparently trying to call
   attention to [1320]his latest book... he'd be ashamed and embarrassed
   to call the current White House conversations as "threats".

   But, the drama, and trumped up controversy might just be good for a
   free publicity on the cable news shows and could pump up the sales of
   his book, no?

   lack of makeup made him look crazy. Bernstein's dialogue was against
   the wars and Woodward was just an......... idiot.

   Woodward is obviously in the bag for rethuglicans.

   Pretty close to the only reassuring thing about this administration is

 WaPo created the problem ([1650]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1651]vcmvo2, [1652]Shotput8

   Bob Woodward and his fellow executives at WaPo and other newspapers
   have for years have fostered a cozy, supportive relationship with White
   House officials, spinning and suppressing stories as administrations
   requested. Naturally, those officials came to expect deference as their
   right. Any subsequent refusal to provide that deference would trigger
   outrage from officials. Woodward, who benefitted handsomely from that
   relationship, should have expected that. Instead, he howled about about
   an alleged threat to his integrity, although  that horse left the barn
   long ago.

   Why does Woodward's [1653]Fact Sheet make no mention of his position as
   WaPo Associate Editor, and instead promote the image of a young
   reporter in the 1970s? Perhaps because that reporter worked for a
   journalism culture that [1654]no longer exists, and Woodward, as a WaPo
   executive, is partly responsible.

   Rather than stir anger at the White House, Woodward's tempest should
   stir public outrage that their trust has been betrayed by newspapers
   like his.

   Recommended by:
          [1720]shaharazade

   For me it comes down to intellectual honesty.

   It is a human trait (I personally know it well from my own self
   deception) that most people lie to themselves when under certain kinds
   of pressure until perhaps they face some painful crisis that destroys
   the barriers they build up over time to hide behind.
   Some rare people seem to be born with? or learn young? to have  the
   courage  to face the truth about themselves and the world around them.

   I think Bob Woodward is first and foremost, as most people are
   including myself, self serving and quite ordinary. Woodward seems to
   have, like most people, built in self serving biases.

   That said, I think in this interview with Hannity he surprisingly tries
   to tone down the partisanship and says that there's too much
   partisanship right now in Washington and the rhetoric shouldt be toned
   down in order to solve critical problems.
   Good for him.....
   I didn't think he was up to that little effort. He is a very
   sanctimonious man who likes being on a pedestall of his own making.

   I so agree with the person who wrote that Woodward is NOT a fine
   journalist. As that commenter said someone such as H.L. Mencken is due
   the credit for intellectual honesty regarding the risks not Woodward.
   He's ust an ordinary guy who's been lucky enough and determined enough
   to make a "successful" well paying career for himself in the snake pit
   that Washington, at its worst, can be.

   By: Jon Walker Thursday February 28, 2013 8:41 am

     But I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying
     saying that Potus asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I
     know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will
     regret staking out that claim. The idea that the sequester was to
     force both sides to go back to try at a big or grand bargain with a
     mix of entitlements and revenues (even if there were serious
     disagreements on composition) was part of the DNA of the thing from
     the start. It was an accepted part of the understanding -- from the
     start. Really. It was assumed by the Rs on the Supercommittee that
     came right after: it was assumed in the November-December 2012
     negotiations. There may have been big disagreements over rates and
     ratios -- but that it was supposed to be replaced by entitlements
     and revenues of some form is not controversial. (Indeed, the
     discretionary savings amount from the Boehner-Obama negotiations
     were locked in in BCA: the sequester was just designed to force all
     back to table on entitlements and revenues.)

 Shaharazade, I don't know what you are trying ([1740]0+ / 0-)
       to suggest here, but let me make one thing clear.  If President
       Obama asks the Democrats to accept entitlement cuts, he will get
       their support.  Period.  He will not need a sequester or anything
       else.  The sequester was intended to force the GOP to pony up
       revenue.  Nothing less, nothing more.
       The President's plan is on the website.  Nancy Pelosi and Harry
       Reid have been intimately involved in all of these "showdown"
       negotiations from the beginning.  They have stated time and time
       again their support for the President's plan.
       We do our side no favors by seemingly insisting that President
       Obama has some "secret" plan to destroy Social
       Security/Medicare/Medicaid.  His plan is there for all to see.  You
       may disagree with it, but you cannot honestly claim it is a
       clandestine mission.  He is trying to mitigate the damage of
       chained CPI with "protections for the vulnerable."  If you want to
       dig into something, why not find out what that entails exactly?

 Ah, I see ([1744]0+ / 0-)
       two legs better. The Democrat's always were for cutting social
       programs and austerity. Right gotcha. Your right, Democratic
       leadership, like Nancy, will support the administrations disaster
       capitalism deficit reduction economic agenda. However I think on a
       political level The Dems are going to have a hard time convincing
       the electorate that there is any good reason to vote for them after
       this ongoing lousy kabuki show. We all have to live in this
       nightmare cooked up, inequitable  austerity economy for and by the
       1%.
       Of course this hasn't been a 'clandestine mission'. It is plain as
       can be what has been going on with the constant manufactured crises
       of financial cliffs of mass destruction for the last 20 months. Not
       a secret plan but one that I and many Democrat's or Indies or even
       Republicans will support. As for 'our side' I am not a member of
       the Obama fan club. You however seem to have forgotten that the
       whole mission we're talking about is his Grand Betrayal Bargain
       which started even before he appointed the Cat Food Commission.
       The chained CPI is his baby just as the rest of this freaking
       anti-democratic bankster Third Way agenda is. It is nothing any
       Democrat should support. I have dug into what the chained CPI
       entails and it's nasty and unnecessary just like all these cuts to
       our social services are. But I forgot he was for the sequester
       before he was against it. This 11 dimension chess game he plays
       leaves me hoping he loses as I do not want what he calls 'victories
       for compromise'.
        Just who are we 'compromising' or bargaining with here and for
       what? To twisty by half and not at all believable.  I guess I just
       don't have the common sense to take the bait even if it's fear of
       the maniac RW. As far as I can see all this negotiating and kabuki
       is just our 'representatives' haggling over the degrees of misery
       and pain they can get away with inflicting on the people and our
       common good.. All for the destruction of any economy that is fit to
       live in. I'm not a Third Way New Democrat, I'm a liberal Democrat
       and this administration are neither Democratic or democratic.

 Woodward is a feeble and pathetic figure. ([1766]0+ / 0-)

   There are still important reporters, however, like [1767]Juan Gonzalez,
   who exposed New Markets Tax Credits that make charter schools a swindle
   for hedge funds, or [1768]Mark Danner, who wrote up the Red Cross
   torture report in 2009 for the New York Review of Books.  Seymour Hersh
   remains vital, as well.

   It's apt that Woodward in his declining years can only get a fair
   hearing on Hannity for his "poutrage."  What a schmuck he's turned out
   to be, huh?

   I'm sick of attempts to steer this nation from principles evolved in

 I am beginning to beleive that Woodward never ([1771]0+ / 0-)

   had much integrity--and that the only reason he ws half of Woodstrien
   and broke Watergate was that he was young and hungry and desperate to
   make a name. It wasn't the need to expose a criminal enterprise that
   fuled that story. It was a hunger to make a name for himself.

   Now he has the name, and he is enjoying basking int he glory of being
   Bobb Woodward--and he protected Bush because Bush stroked him.

   The last time we mixed religion and politics people got burned at the
   stake.

 Woodward ([1777]0+ / 0-)

   is yet another in a long line of hacks whom the mainstream has heaped
   undeserved praise and reverence (see McCain, John).  Finally, the
   covers are starting to be pulled back of some of these clowns, and the
   masses discover that these folks in fact have no clothes.

 Woodward and Valerie Plame ([1783]0+ / 0-)

   Shortly after Robert Novak published his article 'outing' Valerie
   Plame, I had the opportunity to attend a dinner at which Bob Woodward
   was the featured speaker. I spoke with him briefly during the dinner
   and asked him a question that had nagged at me since reading the Novak
   article, which was why Novak wasn't being prosecuted. He asked me what
   I meant, to which I explained that Novak's article seemed to be an
   obvious unauthorized disclosure of national security information -
   orange jumpsuit territory. I suspected the Bush Administration was
   being selective in its enforcement of the Intelligence Identities
   Protection Act when it suited their ends. He seemed truly baffled, when
   as a reporter this should have been at the forefront of his mind (or
   knowing what we know now, maybe he was intentionally playing dumb). Our
   admittedly short interaction helped to re-frame my impression of
   Woodward as less of a reporter and more of a groupie of those in power.
   I think it offends him that he is not being treated with appropriate
   deference by the Obama Administration.

 Wee Wee Wee All The Way Home....To FOX News! ([1786]0+ / 0-)

   Golly Gee, I hope Woodward has satisfactorily recovered from his
   "roughing up" by that big bad wolf.....the WH.

   Don't complain if you get ice cream dripped on you if you go to a soda
   shoppe or mustard on your shirt sleeves when you gulp down a hot dog at
   the corner stand.

   Buck up.  Next thing you know, Woodward will whine if a jelly bean is
   spilled on his carpet on Easter Sunday.

 Ridiculous ([1789]0+ / 0-)

   How Bobby has fallen.  I will forever try to hold in my mind, the image
   of him as one of the great warrior duo which brought down the worst
   crime against our voting system in two hundred years - not the sad,
   befuddled old man who now appears to be willing to say anything for an
   extension of his fifteen minutes.
