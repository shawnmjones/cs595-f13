State-by-State Reports: The Economic Benefits of Fixing Our Broken
Immigration System
       [152]Megan Slack

       America has always been a nation of immigrants, and throughout the
       nation's history, immigrants from around the globe have kept our
       workforce vibrant, our businesses on the cutting edge, and helped
       to build the greatest economic engine in the world. But our
       nation's immigration system is broken and has not kept pace with
       changing times. Today, too many employers game the system by hiring
       undocumented workers and there are 11 million people living and
       working in the shadow economy. Neither is good for the U.S. economy
       or American  families.
       Commonsense immigration reform will strengthen the U.S. economy and
       create jobs. Independent studies affirm that commonsense
       immigration reform will increase economic growth by adding more
       high-demand workers to the labor force, increasing capital
       investment and overall productivity, and leading to greater numbers
       of entrepreneurs starting companies in the U.S.
       Economists, business leaders, and American workers agree -  and
       it's why a bipartisan, diverse coalition of stakeholders have come
       together to urge Congress to act now to fix the broken immigration
       system in a way that requires responsibility from everyone --both
       from unauthorized workers and from those who hire them--and
       guarantees that everyone is playing by the same rules. The Senate
       recently passed a bipartisan, commonsense immigration reform bill
       would do just that - and it's time for the House of Representations
       to join them in taking action to make sure that commonsense
       immigration reform becomes a reality as soon as possible.
       In addition to giving a significant boost to our national economy,
       commonsense immigration reform will also generate important
       economic benefits in each state, from increasing workers' wages and
       generating new tax revenue to strengthening the local industries
       that are the backbone of states' economies. The new state by state
       reports below detail how just how immigration reform would
       strengthen the economy and create jobs all regions of our country.
       We must take advantage of this historic opportunity to fix our
       broken immigration system in a comprehensive way. At stake is a
       stronger, more dynamic, and faster growing economy that will foster
       job creation, higher productivity and wages, and entrepreneurship.
