Usher's ex-wife cites son's pool mishap in custody bid

   By Alan Duke, CNN
   updated 9:13 PM EDT, Wed August 7, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Usher Raymond says his son is "doing well and is recovering"
     * Tameka Foster accuses Usher of being gone 85% of the time
     * His aunt and a housekeeper noticed the child was stuck in the
       pool's drain, police say
     * Sound technician Eugene Stachurski rescued the child and used CPR
       to revive him

   (CNN) -- Usher Raymond's ex-wife is asking a judge to give her custody
   of their two children after the oldest suffered a "near-death
   accident."

   Five-year-old Usher Raymond V "nearly drown in a swimming pool and is
   currently hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Children's
   Healthcare of Atlanta Hospital," Tameka Raymond said in an emergency
   motion filed in a Fulton County, Georgia, court Tuesday.

   In a statement released Wednesday, the singer said his son "is doing
   well and is recovering."

   The statement did not address his ex-wife's motion for custody.

   "I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of prayers, love and support for my
   family's well-being," the statement said.

   Usher, as he is known professionally in his career as a singer, dancer
   and actor, won primary custody of the children last year after a bitter
   court fight in which Foster accused him of being an absentee father.

   Foster renewed her arguments based on Monday's accident, contending the
   singer "continues to excessively travel, utilizes third-party
   caregivers to supervise the minor children rather than personally
   exercising parenting time and providing supervision for the minor
   children."

   Usher is "not capable of providing daily caregiving and supervision for
   the minor children of the parties as petitioner is preparing to film a
   movie in Panama and has ongoing commitments that require his presence
   in Los Angeles, New York and various other cities for the Voice and his
   upcoming album."

   Her motion alleges that Usher is away from Atlanta -- where she and the
   children live "in excess of 85% of each month." He refuses to let her
   see the children when he leaves towns, saying he "would rather the
   nanny raise the children," Foster contends.
   911 call: Usher's son stuck in pool drain
   2012: Usher's stepson dies

   Foster also complained that her ex-husband does not talk to her about
   issue affecting the boys, "including school enrollment and summer
   activities." The private school in which he just enrolled them is more
   than an hour from her home, she said. Usher has not given her the phone
   number to the home he moved to with the children in June, she said.

   "As the result of the negligence and failure to properly supervise the
   minor child, U.R.,V, nearly drown in a swimming pool and is currently
   hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Children's Healthcare of
   Atlanta Hospital, undergoing treatment for the injuries sustained on
   August 5, 2013."

   She blames the swimming accident on "the negligence and failure to
   properly supervise" the children. Usher's aunt was in charge of the
   children when the oldest son "suffered a near-death accident while left
   unsupervised in a swimming pool," the motion contends.

   "I need an ambulance," his aunt, Rena Oden, told an emergency operator
   in a call to 911. "My nephew was in the pool, and I couldn't get him, I
   tried to get him." A recording of the call was made public by police
   Tuesday.

   The aunt, housekeeper and another woman were "unsuccessful in pulling
   the victim from the pool drain," but two men -- Eugene Stachurski and
   Ben Crews -- who were installing sound equipment in the home rushed to
   help, the report said.

   "They're doing CPR on him now," Oden told the operator. "Is he coming
   around? He's breathing!"

   Stachurski, a sound technician, rescued the child from the drain and
   used CPR to revive him on the side of the pool, the police report said.

   About five minutes into the recording, Oden told the operator that
   paramedics had arrived at the home and had taken over.

   The child was "conscious, alert and breathing" when the ambulance took
   him to a hospital, where he was kept overnight for observation, the
   police report said.

   Usher thanked Stachurski and Crews for saving his son's life. "They are
   true heroes and I am deeply grateful to them," Usher said in the
   statement.

   Usher's former stepson -- also Foster's son -- died in a [41]watercraft
   accident on a north Georgia lake last year.

   CNN's NIschelle Turner and Marylynn Ryan contributed to this report.
