CNN poll: Public against Syria strike resolution

   By Paul Steinhauser and John Helton, CNN
   updated 12:49 PM EDT, Mon September 9, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * 7 in 10 poll respondents say they don't think a strike on Syria
       would achieve U.S. goals
     * Poll comes at beginning of a pivotal week for President Obama
     * The president has had at least a small majority behind him in
       recent conflicts
     * About eight in 10 believe al-Assad regime is or is likely behind
       chemical weapons attack

   Washington (CNN) -- As President Barack Obama presses his case for a
   strike on Syria, a new national survey shows him swimming against a
   strong tide of public opinion that doesn't want the United States to
   get involved.

   The CNN/ORC International poll released on Monday shows that even
   though eight in 10 Americans believe that Bashar al-Assad's regime
   gassed its own people, a strong majority doesn't want Congress to pass
   a resolution authorizing a military strike against it.

   More than seven in 10 say such a strike would not achieve significant
   goals for the United States and a similar amount say it's not in the
   national interest for the country to get involved in Syria's civil war.

   The poll comes at the start of a pivotal week for the president.

   The Senate is expected to take up the resolution after returning from
   its summer recess on Monday while Obama participates in a round of
   interviews with the major television outlets. Wolf Blitzer's interview
   with Obama will air Monday on "The Situation Room" at 6 p.m. ET.

   [42]Three questions for Obama

   Amid a flurry of briefings by White House officials, Obama will travel
   to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to make his case with lawmakers hours before
   he speaks to the nation in a prime-time address.

   "Even as he works members of Congress one by one in small group
   settings, President Obama's biggest challenge is the American public at
   large," said John King, CNN chief national correspondent.

   "More than seven in 10 Americans simply don't see a military response
   making any difference. They don't see it doing any good. They're very
   skeptical, post Iraq and even post Libya and post Egypt, that the
   United States can do something in a limited way in the Middle East and
   walk away with a success. And so the skepticism is driving it right
   now."

   The stakes are high for the president.

   After pushing for strikes against Syria, Obama unexpectedly announced
   on August 31 that he would ask Congress to authorize military action.
   Failing to get Congress to go along would be an embarrassment for the
   commander in chief.

   "He'll go to establishing a new high bar to what it means to being a
   lame duck this early," CNN contributor and Republican strategist Ana
   Navarro said. "It would be devastating, I think, for rest of his
   agenda."

   But Stephanie Cutter, another CNN contributor who was Obama's 2012
   deputy campaign manager, said Congress's not passing the resolution
   would be "a blow to the United States, not a blow to the president.
   It's a blow to the United States' authority all over the world. And
   unprecedented."

   "That's why you're going to see some members of Congress vote for that
   particular reason. Some said they're voting for that particular
   reason," she said.

   [43]Obama faces steep climb in House

   The Senate could vote on the resolution as early as Wednesday and the
   outcome there is very much in doubt. Even more uncertain are prospects
   in the House where Republican leaders say they'll wait to see what
   happens in the Senate first.

   "Congressional approval would help Obama a little, but a majority would
   still oppose airstrikes against military targets in Syria," CNN Polling
   Director Keating Holland said. "If Congress authorizes military action,
   55% of Americans would still oppose airstrikes."

   The president has had at least a small majority of public support
   behind him in conflicts involving the United States over the past 20
   years.

   Eighty-six percent of those surveyed in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll
   less than a month after the 9/11 terror attacks favored military
   action, and 56% backed the United States and its allies in creating a
   "no-fly" zone over Libya in 2011.
   On Syria, Obama could face impeachment
   Pope Francis against strike in Syria
   Should Obama act in Syria without public support?
   Doubts remain over who's behind attack

   Only U.S. involvement in NATO airstrikes on Serbia in 1999 during the
   Clinton administration split the public down the middle, with 43%
   supporting involvement and 40% opposing it.

   [44]'This is not Iraq or Afghanistan'

   While 64% supported using American ground troops in Iraq in 2003,
   intelligence indicating Saddam Hussein was building weapons of mass
   destruction was later discredited. That has contributed to public
   doubts about Obama administration claims of evidence showing that
   al-Assad's regime gassed its own people on August 21 outside Damascus,
   killing more than 1,400 people.

   Fifty-nine percent of people questioned say they don't think Congress
   should approve a proposed resolution authorizing military action
   against Syria for up to 90 days -- an initial 60-day window plus
   another 30 following congressional notification -- but prohibiting the
   use of ground troops. About 40% support that plan.

   If Congress rejects the Syria resolution, the White House has said that
   the president still has the authority to strike.

   "I think it would be a mistake for me to jump the gun and speculate
   because right now I'm working to get as much support as possible out of
   Congress," Obama said on Friday when asked by CNN senior White House
   correspondent Brianna Keilar what he would do if the resolution failed.

   But the poll indicates Americans are quite clear on that point: More
   than seven in 10 say they would oppose U.S. airstrikes against Syria if
   Congress does not authorize it.

   [45]Who are the Syrian rebels?

   The debate over Syria has caused intra-party divides among both
   parties: Hawkish Republicans and moderate Democrats say the United
   States should strike, while the libertarian wing of the GOP says
   involvement is not in the U.S. interest. Liberal Democrats say there
   are alternatives to military action that haven't been exhausted.

   The poll also suggests those surveyed who identified themselves as
   Democrats and Republicans don't see eye to eye on the resolution.
   Fifty-six percent of Democrats think Congress should pass it, but only
   36% of Republicans and 29% of independents say the same.

   "Bringing Congress into the equation seems to have added a political
   dimension to the Syria debate," Holland said. "Once Congress makes up
   its mind, however, the gap between Democrats and Republicans nearly
   vanishes."

   [46]'House of Assad' survives on loyalty, brutality

   If Congress does authorize military action, the gap between Democrats
   and Republicans shrinks to just four points, with 51% of Democrats and
   47% of Republicans favoring military action. And if Congress rejects
   the resolution authorizing military action, large numbers in both
   parties oppose airstrikes.

   "It appears that while the debate is still in the hands of Congress,
   politics will affect Americans' views on Syria," Holland said.
   "Politics may still stop at the water's edge for most Americans, but
   Capitol Hill remains a highly partisan environment, even when
   international affairs are being debated."

   The poll gives some insight into why many Americans oppose action.

   While more than eight in 10 say that it's likely or certain that the
   Syrian government used chemical weapons, nearly seven in 10 say that
   it's not in the U.S. national interest to get involved in Syria's civil
   war. And more than seven in 10 say that airstrikes would not achieve
   significant goals for the U.S.

   [47]Syria's neighbors on edge

   And while most of those questioned said that how their members of
   Congress voted on the resolution wouldn't affect how they voted in
   future elections, but the remainder by a nearly 3-1 margin said they
   would be more likely to vote against the lawmakers if they supported
   the resolution.

   The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International on September 6-8, with
   1,022 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall
   sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
