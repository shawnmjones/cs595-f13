   At Spytalk, Jeff Stein writes [29]CIA's Madame X Waits in the Wings

    "She knew her CTC work would come back to bite her, and said as much
    back when we were both on the 7th floor," a former colleague says of
   Madame X, the undercover woman CIA Director John Brennan is considering
    to run the National Clandestine Service, the belfry where the spooks
                                  hang out.

       "She was quite nervous when Justice was considering whether to
    prosecute folks involved in the interrogation program," the colleague
         added.  It "will be interesting to see how this plays out."

   "She's just an excellent officer," the colleague said. "Very savvy and
             extremely competent - and would be a great choice."

   The woman had "mastered several languages and served multiple tours in
    Moscow and other cities overseas," according to The Washington Post's
   Greg Miller and Julie Tate, who sent spy tongues wagging Wednesday with
   [30]their delicious insider account on the angst Brennan is said to be
      feeling over appointing a person to run the NCS who was "heavily
     involved in the interrogation program at the beginning and for the
   first couple of years," according to a former senior U.S. intelligence
                            official they quoted.

   In 2005, the woman, who has held several senior CIA posts, was chief of
     staff when both signed the infamous order for underlings to destroy
    videotapes of harsh interrogations at a secret CIA detention site in
                              Thailand.  [...]

   [33]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2004--GOP donors
   funding Nader:

                      We all knew this was happening...
   Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader is getting a little help
            from his friends - and from George W. Bush's friends.

   Nearly 10 percent of the Nader contributors who have given him at least
      $250 each have a history of supporting the Republican president,
    national GOP candidates or the party, according to computer-assisted
           review of financial records by The Dallas Morning News.
   Among the new crop of Nader donors: actor and former Nixon speechwriter
    Ben Stein, Florida frozen-food magnate Jeno Paulucci and Pennsylvania
   oil company executive Terrence Jacobs. All have strong ties to the GOP.

   On today's [39]Kagro in the Morning show, Greg Dworkin joined the
   discussion of a new category of #GunFAIL: guns people claim they
   "forgot" they were carrying. Cold, dead hands! But also, I totally
   forgot I even had a gun! But some think there's no point in the TSA
   screening for guns at all. Also: cops having trouble finding bullets,
   thanks to hoarders, who in turn blame shortages on hoarding by cops,
   because Reality! 2nd hour: WalMart runs itself into the ground in a
   vicious cycle wherein the drive for bigger management bonuses depends
   on cutting payroll, and when short-staffing hurts sales, they
   compensate by... cutting payroll. Yeah. Austerity much?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [53]Tagging tips - [54]Search For Tags - [55]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   We've added [234]a whopping 1,599 more users in the last 24 hours.
   This is a continuation going back to May where we've been absolutely
   flooded with new users.  I'm pretty sure almost all of these new users
   are spammers or bots.  While the rate had been getting faster, it seems
   they suddenly started slowing down right when Hurricane Sandy hit.  It
   slowed down to under 1,000 new users in a 24-hour period, and we were
   back down to somewhat over 100 new users every 24 hours or so, until
   about January 30th, when it exploded again.  What are they

       Perhaps a botnet that logs in these 500k auto-generated new users
       and has them simultaneously post diaries?
       Like a sock puppet diary-based DDOS attack or something. Probably a
       lot less trouble to do it the regular way.
       I'm sure the attackers will be discovered, especially if it comes
       from the other side of the aisle...Republicans aren't the most
       tech-savvy group. Unless they hire somebody.
       Whatever the case, it would be malicious and wouldn't end well for
       the attackers once they're discovered.

                [606]DeadHead, [607]Ender, [608]Eric Nelson

       Conservative who also really hates 5-4 decisions. He'll vote for a
       narrow ruling to overturn DOMA, returning marriage back to the
       states (but not with a wide-reaching  Loving type decision.).
       They'll kick the California case for lack of standing, returning it
       to the status that was granted by its then-governor (a Republican
       at that) who refused to uphold the ban.
       All this deference to the states allows him to kill VRA while being
       consistent to the same principles: respecting the rights of the
       states.
       I hope I'm wrong about Roberts and VRA. Deep down, I have a hard
       time seeing him believing that whole "racial entitlement" bit. But
       if he does, he has an easy way to present this as a consistent (and
       actually "conservative") package with something for everyone.

       But [614]Rachel Maddow & her staff got right down to the heart of

   has been altered.

   (CPI is the Consumer Price Index.)

   The introduction of substitution for what formerly was a constant
   weighted basket of goods. Formerly, if the price of an item in the
   basket rose, the CPI rose by the increase multiplied by the weight of
   that item in the basket.

   In our new substitution-based measure, if the price of an item in the
   basket goes up, the item is removed from the basket and a cheaper item
   is put in its place. For example, if the price of ground chuck rises,
   the new CPI substitutes the price of a cheaper mix.

   Here's the problem with this: Our official rate of inflation is kept
   low by measuring not a fixed standard of living but a declining
   standard of living.

       Ritholtz, and others, have been harping on about hedonic
       substitution for a long time. It used to be T-bone and now is
       hamburger, what's next? You can go but so far before everyone calls
       B.S. on it. Perhaps they'll say "we are all vegetarians now", and
       cardboard will be considered a vegetable. With these types you
       never know.
       "The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie --
       deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth, persistent,
       persuasive, and unrealistic. Belief in myths allows the comfort of
       opinion without the discomfort of thought." -John F. Kennedy

   torture. Dude only got his current job because caring about torture is
   so last decade.

   Considering the recent announcement that the CIA will only engage in
   drone operations where it engages in drone operations, leaving the
   Pentagon to its traditional role of bombing those places not being
   bombed by the CIA, it looks like Brennan's job is to make the CIA
   appear less paramilitary-ish. Harder to pull that off when, at the same
   time, you try to one-up the Director's passive awareness of our torture
   regime by promoting a central actor in the policy to a position just
   below him.

 More HuffPo Nonsense on Immigration this time ([821]0+ / 0-)

   I think I'll do a diary on how editors distort decent reporting...

   This morning I follow a head that says something to the effect that
   "Majority still doesn't support path to citizenship."

   Read the article: The survey had 3 choices. 46 percent support path to
   citizenship, then something like 21 percent permanent residency and
   about that many want to put them all on busses. Now, anyone can see
   that a 3 choice survey isn't going to have a majority (except
   background checks for gun control!) But the editor deliberately skews
   the results with the headline.

   Yesterday it was a Sebelius quote on insurance rates that was distorted
   by the editors.

   Is Fineman part of that editorial team? Who is skewing HuffPo so far
   right these days?
