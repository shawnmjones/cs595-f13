Professor accused of poisoning wife with cyanide waives extradition

   From John Berman and Marlei Martinez, CNN
   updated 5:29 PM EDT, Mon July 29, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Robert Ferrante is expected to be moved Tuesday
     * The cause of his wife's death is cyanide poisoning
     * "He's anxious to defend himself," his lawyer says

   (CNN) -- A University of Pittsburgh research professor waived
   extradition Monday during a hearing in West Virginia as authorities
   seek his return to Pennsylvania, where he's accused of killing his wife
   with a lethal dose of cyanide.

   Robert Ferrante was not expected to fight extradition.

   "He's anxious to defend himself, have his day in court, prove his
   innocence," said Ferrante's defense attorney William Difenderfer.

   Pennsylvania police have 10 days to pick him up, said assistant
   prosecutor Andy Dimlich.

   According to Mike Manko, spokesman for the Allegheny County district
   attorney's office, police will transport Ferrante from West Virginia to
   the Allegheny County Jail on Tuesday.

   Ferrante is accused of killing Autumn Klein, a 41-year-old accomplished
   Pittsburgh doctor. She was the former head of women's neurology at the
   University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

   Ferrante is a researcher and professor of neurological surgery at the
   University of Pittsburgh.

   As part of his position there, Ferrante managed a laboratory where he
   conducts trials of various drugs and chemicals, according to a criminal
   complaint.

   Text messages between the couple were found on April 17, the day Klein
   fell ill, the complaint said. The exchange included Ferrante suggesting
   creatine to Klein in hopes of stimulating egg production.

   The complaint also alleges that a day earlier, Ferrante had placed an
   order for an "overnight delivery of cyanide."

   Investigators allege that Ferrante laced the creatine with cyanide.

   Cyanide is a naturally occurring toxic substance that can be found in
   seeds of different plants. It is widely distributed throughout research
   laboratories as a chemical used in scientific experiments.

   Cyanide interferes with the ability of the body to use oxygen to
   produce energy, which can lead to rapid death.

   On April 17, Allegheny County 911 dispatch received a call from
   Ferrante requesting medical assistance for his wife, who he said was
   possibly having a stroke, the complaint read. He described her
   condition as "conscious and breathing, but not alert."

   When paramedics arrived, they found the victim on the floor of the
   kitchen with a plastic bag containing creatine.

   She died April 20.

   According to Karl Williams, chief medical examiner of Allegheny County,
   there is no connection between creatine and fertility. Creatine is a
   supplement that bodybuilders use to increase body mass, Williams said.

   "The amazing amount of subpoenas of investigation that went in to
   determining in fact that it was a homicide. That's what took so long,"
   Williams said.

   Ferrante's arrest Thursday ended a nationwide manhunt. Officials said
   West Virginia State Police apprehended him after his car was stopped
   while heading north on Interstate 77 near Beckley, West Virginia.

   "He was relatively quiet," said State Police Sgt. William Tupper. "He
   knew there were warrants for him. Said he was en route back to
   Pittsburgh."

   Ferrante has been placed on immediate and indefinite leave from his
   university, according to school spokesman John Andrew Fedele.

   Sole and legal custody of Ferrante's child has been placed with the
   maternal grandparents, according to a statement form the district
   attorney's office.

   His financial assets have also been frozen.
