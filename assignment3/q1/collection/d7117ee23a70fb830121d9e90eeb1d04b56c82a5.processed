A month on, Wisconsin Dems take Senate

   Van Wanggaard for State Senate/Facebook

   More than a month after losing his recall election, Wisconsin
   Republican State Senator Van Wanggaard has conceded the race. This
   gives Wisconsin Democrats control of the Senate. Wanggaard had gotten a
   recount that showed him still losing by more than 800 votes. He then
   had until the end of today to decide whether to sue over the results.
   The [3]Wisconsin State Journal runs his statement. A snip:

     "The seemingly never-ending delay by Dane County judges preventing
     implementation of Wisconsin's voter ID law undoubtedly played a role
     in this recall election. Even if I were to challenge and win in
     Racine County court, an appeal to that challenge would be heard in
     the Madison's Court of Appeals. A challenge would also be extremely
     costly to taxpayers, who have already been forced to waste $20
     million on the recall election.

     "Despite pleas from around the state to challenge the election, it
     is not in the best interests of Racine, or Wisconsin, at this time.
     Now is the time to focus on gaining the state senate back in
     November, winning Wisconsin's U.S. Senate seat, and electing
     Governor Romney as President."

   Wanggaard has made charges of suspicious activity at the polls
   throughout the recount process. To the extent that things went awry,
   much of it had to do with clerks making mistakes in complying with the
   part of state's new voting law that was in place. The [4]Government
   Accountability Board says that where clerks failed to get voters to
   sign a poll book, as the new law requires, their errors shouldn't
   invalidate voters' votes.

     judges preventing implementation of Wisconsin's voter ID law
     undoubtedly played a role in this recall election.

   Wow, they are not even embarrassed to say it out loud. Voter I.D. laws
   are needed to keep Republicans in office. The judges are against them,
   the voters are against them, so now they have to get someone in the
   elections office to say "we found some ballots that got misplaced".

   It's catapulting the propaganda all right. Couldn't be that people
   don't want them in office. Then, the Rmoney fundraisers saying, "the
   commoners don't get it".

   My,my nice try. So Wisconsin has a new law they thought would give the
   right a clear win? Uh excuse me sir/m;am, I see you are a
   republican-please sign the book so YOUR vote counts (but do it quietly
   lest the dems catch on)

   Pretty much the definition of a sore loser right there.
