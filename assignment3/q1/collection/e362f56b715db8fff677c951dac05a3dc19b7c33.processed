   [30]outlandish pronouncements about gay people for the Ms. Blog.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [49]Tagging tips - [50]Search For Tags - [51]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Supreme courts are named for their Chief Justices, e.g., the Warren
   Court, the Marshall Court, the Rehnquist Court. If Roberts allows the
   right-wing justices to define "his" court in cases of marriage
   equality, he will share the ignominy of Chief Justice Melville Fuller
   whose Court decided Plessy v. Ferguson. I doubt that's the legacy he
   wants to leave to history, although extreme self-righteousness is a
   disease that has infected more than one chief justice.

 Slavery is OK in Christianity. ([243]0+ / 0-)
       Don't know if you have ever read the Bible but there are numerous
       passages in the Bible on the proper care of one's slaves.  And also
       rules on who can and who cannot can be enslaved.
       So "founded on Christian principles" is not an argument against
       slavery.

 I was making that point exactly. Even Christian ([247]0+ / 0-)
       (or supposedly Christian) countries had no problems with slavery
       for thousands of year. However, all of a sudden, the abolition
       movement began reinterpreting bible passages to say that slavery
       should not be allowed. Now, many Christians will insist that their
       religion did not endorse of promote slavery, which is total
       bullshit.
       I spent many years being forced to read the bible as a kid. But, I
       found it to be of very little value, since it is fairly easy for
       people to make it mean whatever they want it to mean.

 3/5 of a man. ([255]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [256]Nova Land

   Scalia often cites precedent when he makes arguments and this is in
   part where his statement on sodomy comes from.

   One of his questions on gay marriage to one of the lawyers was to ask
   that since gay marriage had always been disallowed, when exactly did
   banning gay marriage suddenly become unconstitutional.

   I would have loved to follow that with this response:
   "I don't know Mr Justice, when did the black man become 5/5 of a
   person?"

   If Scalia were to then answer that that happened with the 15th
   amendment I would follow that up with:
   "So Mr Justice, are you saying that while you and I are endowed by our
   creator with certain inalienable rights, that Justice Thomas is not?
   That he gets those rights only because of the 15th amendment?
   Seriously?  Now Mr. Justice, that sounds like a reasonable conclusion
   for 1870, but do you really believe such a thing in the 21st century?"
