   2013 Daily Kos Republican March to Madness Tourney Teabaggers Region:
   First round results
   Full tournament bracket and results [29]here.
   Welcome to day one of second round action in the Teabaggers region:
   Today we start picking the Insane 16. You can cast your votes for
   today's matchups from [30]this page or follow the direct links in the
   game summaries below.

   You're voting for whomever you think is the best poster-child for
   Republican craziness, however you define it. That doesn't necessarily
   mean mean you have to pick the person who's crazier. For example, you
   might think Herman Cain is more off his rocker than Jim DeMint, but
   that Jim DeMint is a better poster-child because he's got more clout in
   the GOP and conservative movement than Cain. It's entirely up to you.

   With that out of the way, here are the matchups:
     * [31]#1 Ted Cruz vs. #9 Jim DeMint: [32]Vote here!
     * [33]#4 Michele Bachmann vs. #12 Joe Arpaio: [34]Vote here!

   Remember, you can [35]vote from a single page or follow the individual
   links above. As with yesterday, you've got until about 8:30 AM ET on
   Sunday to cast your ballot.

   You can see the full tournament bracket as well as yesterday's results
   [36]here.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   ____________________________________________________________

   ____________________________________________________________
   Are you sure you want to remove this diary from your hotlist?
   Are you sure you want to remove your recommendation? You can only
   recommend a diary once, so you will not be able to re-recommend it
   afterwards.

 Two truly titanic match ups in this round ([73]2+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [74]citisven, [75]TomFromNJ

       I've got go with crazy over mean and that gives me Cruz and
       Bachmann. Sorry, Joe, but your just an asshole not a crazy asshole.
       You can't assassinate the character of any of modern conservative.
       You'd have to find where it was buried, dig it up, resurrect it,
       then kill it. And killing a zombie isn't really assassination, is
       it?

 Teabag Pix ([78]0+ / 0-)
       #1 - Cruz
       Fast tracking to teabagger royalty and DeMint gave up his clout.
       #2 - Arpaio
       A Very Special Sort of Slimy and Bachmann's fading away.
       You show a little grit and you lands in jail.
