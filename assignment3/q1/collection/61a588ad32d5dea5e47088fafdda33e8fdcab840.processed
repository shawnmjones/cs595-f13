   The usual introduction: yep, I'm here at CPAC. Here's a not so brief
   photo diary to give you a feel for the place, and I've added my own
   notes about what's been going on.
   Old political buttons for sale at CPAC 2013
   Buttons for sale.
   Lots of pics, below the fold.

   Tea Partier in full Revolutionary War regalia
   A tea partier, dressed in full Revolutionary War regalia. He has
   attended each day in full gear and carrying a large Don't Tread on Me
   flag. He's the only one, or close to it; while there are some others in
   unconventional gear, the preferred costume for the event is a full
   business suit. Lots, and lots, and lots of them.
   Tea Party News Network booth at CPAC 2013
   From radio row (which, inconveniently, is crammed right next to the
   main event ballroom, causing severe traffic jams before and after every
   major speaker.) There are a number of polished, slick-looking booths
   for conservative-only media outlets like this one, the Tea Party News
   Network.
   NRA target practice booth at CPAC 2013
   The NRA has a big presence on the speaking lists, but a surprisingly
   modest presence in the exhibit hall. This is the NRA target practice
   booth, where you can try your hand at shooting (standard, round)
   targets at various virtual distances. Yes, that's a fake gun, which
   makes all these people wimps. A real American would have a real target
   range in the middle of the exhibit hall, you pansies.
   Booth at CPAC 2013: Napolitano 2016
   A very lonely booth indeed is the from the "committee" to draft Judge
   Napolitano as a 2016 presidential candidate. I don't even know what
   they're thinking on this one. Most of the booths are fairly modest and
   very lightly populated.
   Game at CPAC 2013: An arcade game carrying the title "Mine, Dig and
   Drill America Back to Prosperity." Those are little toy globes. And
   that's all I'm going to say about that.
   Shirts for sale at CPAC 2013: Keep Calm and Fight Socialism, that
   middle shirt says. I've gotta say, none of the people here talking
   about socialism have seemed very calm about it at all. Far from it!

   In past years, CPAC has had trouble with vendors selling, er,
   controversial things. This year seems to have brought tighter
   controls--or, perhaps, stronger warnings--and aside from bumper
   stickers with slogans like "Save the Males" or "Fight Crime: Shoot
   First", most of the merchandise (like this) is unabashedly
   conservative, but, what's the word? More conventional? Not as far-far
   right as it could be? Maybe I'm just jaded at this point.
   Media section at CPAC 2013
   The media section in the main hall is enormous, spanning nearly half
   the room, front to back, and taking up the entire center section. It's
   huge, and as you can see, well-populated. These are the people who get
   to hear speakers complain about how the media just isn't listening to
   the conservative point of view.

   Cameras are omnipresent, though most of the cameras doing constant
   interviews in the main lobby do seem to be from conservative
   organizations mostly interviewing attendees, important in-movement
   folks and each other.
   Mitt Romney speaking at CPAC 2013
   Mitt Romney speaking to a full room. The room is long and wide. The
   front center below him is reserved for VIP audience members, meaning
   members who have paid the $1,000-per-head ticket price (the three-day
   fee for non-VIPs is about $200, but that doesn't get you into the
   dinner speeches by the big speakers.) Behind that, the media section
   takes up all the rest of the center space, leaving most of the rest of
   the audience with a bit of a distant (and sideways) view.

   I hear there's a picture going around of the half-empty room when
   Donald Trump was up to speak. A good part of that may have been the
   pre-9am hour; they certainly gave him the crappiest speaking slot of
   the day, which makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
   CPAC 2013 convention hall, mostly empty
   The same room photographed from the same position five to 10 minutes
   after Romney concluded his speech. The next panel in the room was the
   pro-life panel, and the audience, it is fair to say, left in droves.
   While there is a definite contingent of anti-abortion activists here,
   you will hear only the vaguest of mentions of it from most of the other
   speakers. The anti-abortion speakers that are here seem to be more,
   let's call it belligerent than any other sub-group, and stand out. The
   panelist in this case was going on about Planned Parenthood like it
   really did have an "Abortionplex". Did you know that Planned Parenthood
   made a bajillion dollars from abortions, and that it makes up the vast
   majority of everything they do? Neither did I.

   More later, obviously, but this ought to give a fine feel for the
   place.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [45]Tagging tips - [46]Search For Tags - [47]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       ... as the Republican Presidential nominee - [399]to FDR in 1944 by
       432-99 electoral votes and to [400]Harry Truman in 1948 by 303-189

       I wrote about the 1948 Election in this 2010 diary - [401]The Week
       in Editorial Cartoons- Mission Accomplished

     [What27s_the_use_of_going_through_wi.jpg]

     In this 1948 editorial cartoon by Clifford K. Berryman of the
     [402]Washington Star, Truman seems unfazed by bad polls, negative
     statements announcing his political demise, or taunting by his
     opponent, Governor Tom Dewey (R-NY), who most political pundits
     (including many Democrats) were expecting to see elected as their
     next president.

   David Keene...chairman at American Conservative Union  (1984-2011).

   CPAC is an ACU event...CPAC is also co-sponsered by the NRA.

   Keene left the ACU to lead the NRA...after his ex-wife [476]Diana Carr
   (ACU administrative director) was convicted of embezzlement.

   His son...[477]David M. Keene (ACU communication director) is currently
   serving 10 years in prison for shooting at another motorist while
   heading to target practice.

     David Michael Keene, the prominent national conservative activist's
     son charged in a road rage shooting on the George Washington
     Memorial Parkway, was

     institutionalized with "severe emotional problems" seven times
     between the ages of 8 and 13, his mother said Tuesday.

     "He's had a continuing problem with impulse control, and an
     exaggerated belief that he was in more danger than he was in at
     times, causing him to respond in a way that was more excessive or
     out of line with what was going on," Keene's mother, Diana Carr,
     told reporters outside the U.S. District Court in Alexandria.

   but daddy David did receive the Martin Luther King Award from the
   Congress on Racial Equality...of course the CoRE's chairman [478]Roy
   Innis is also on the board of the NRA.

   [599]ThinkProgress explains:

     The exchange occurred after an audience member from North Carolina,
     30-year-old Scott Terry, asked whether Republicans could endorse
     races remaining separate but equal. After the presenter, K. Carl
     Smith of Frederick Douglass Republicans, answered by referencing a
     letter by Frederick Douglass forgiving his former master, the
     audience member said "For what? For feeding him and housing him?"

     After the exchange, Terry muttered under his breath, "why can't we
     just have segregation?" noting the Constitution's protections for
     freedom of association.

     [852]CPAC Event On Racial Tolerance Turns To Chaos As
     `Disenfranchised' Whites Arrive

     A CPAC session sponsored by Tea Party Patriots and billed as a
     primer on teaching activists how to court black voters devolved into
     a shouting match as some attendees demanded justice for white voters
     and others shouted down a black woman who reacted in horror.

   Because white southern males are being systematically disenfranchised.

       I agree that Democrats are imperfect, but that does not mean that
       this makes conservatives just as good.
       When conservatives abandon bigotry and selfishness, I will consider
       whether they are on their way to a moral stand that can be worthy
       of consideration.

   Is this T-shirt pushing Rubio for President, Rick Scott for VP?  Don't
   these idiots know that electors can't vote for both a VP and a
   President as themselves, per the 12th amendment?  Meaning in a
   Rubio-Scott ticket, if they carry Florida, the Republican electors from
   Florida can't vote for both Rubio and Scott.  The 12th amendment
   effectively bars a presidential and vice presidential ticket where both
   are from the same state.
