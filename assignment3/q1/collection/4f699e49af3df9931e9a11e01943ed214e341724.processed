   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   Late Night Snark: Faxes, Phones & Crazytown Edition
   Teletype
   "Look, kids! It's an incoming
   message from Hepcat Reince!"
   -

     "A new report says if Republicans want to win over young voters they
     need to get up to date with technology. Well, the GOP is listening
     because today they told young people everywhere to 'Be prepared to
     receive a very exciting fax from us.'"
     ---Conan O'Brien
     -
     "The lights are a little dimmer in Crazytown tonight. In the
     struggle between reality and Michele Bachmann, reality has won.
     Flags are being flown at half mast at the Laugh Factory. Michele
     Bachmann is out. Still no word on her husband Marcus."
     ---Bill Maher
     -
     "I may run for another public office. That could happen."
     ---Michele Bachmann, to Sean Hannity
     -
     "Verizon's business services division was ordered by the FBI to
     deliver millions of customers' "telephony metadata." That's a lot of
     jargon so let me break it down for you: Metadata means information
     about a call's length, location and participants. Telephony is what
     a two-year-old calls a telephone."
     ---Stephen Colbert
     -
     "A man in California received eleven pounds of marijuana in the mail
     by mistake. At least he did the right thing---he called the police
     and told them someone accidentally mailed him five pounds of
     marijuana."
     ---Craig Ferguson

   And five years ago on The Daily Show, shortly after Obama won enough
   primary delegates to put him over the top:

     Clip of Joe Scarborough from December, 2006:  "[Hillary Clinton]
     will crush Obama.  Barack, just sit it out.  It's going to be ugly,
     I promise you.  You heard it here first."
     Jon Stewart:  News pundits. They're like the Doppler-less weathermen
     of our time.

   C&J welcomes all of our readers at the NSA. Please...help yourself to
   some paste 'n crackers.

   Your west coast-friendly edition of  Cheers and Jeers starts below the
   fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!]

   Cheers and Jeers for Friday, June 7, 2013

   Note:  Yikes---I just saw one of the ten lords a' leaping face-down in
   the gutter with an empty bottle of Jack Daniels in his hand.  The
   off-season can be brutal sometimes.

   Puppy Pic of the Day:  The warm-weather version of [31]making a snow
   angel

   -

   CHEERS to progress via the Democratic Party.  Remember in 2010 when
   John Boehner released [32]this video asking why President Obama hadn't
   yet snapped his fingers and made all the jobs that Republicans flushed
   down the toilet in 2008 magically reappear?  ("14 months of 9.5+
   Percent Unemployment!!!" screams a graphic.)  And remember when John
   Boehner promised "jobs jobs jobs" when he became Speaker of the House
   and then abandoned his pledge so his out-of-control tea party minions
   could instead declare war on women, voter rights, the poor, the
   elderly, our veterans, students and---37 times---Obamacare?  Well,
   despite the GOP's best efforts to put as many Americans as possible out
   of a job (including Obama), things [33]are holding steady:
   Summary: Bush's legacy is on
   the left, Obama's is on the right.
   -

     Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 175,000 in May, and
     the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at 7.6 percent, the
     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Employment rose in
     professional and business services, food services and drinking
     places, and retail trade.

   And because of Democrats' singlehanded stewardship of the economy,
   consumer confidence is [34]at a six-year high and the stock market is
   soaring.  My point: if you need to reach John Boehner this weekend,
   you'll find him crying in his scotch at the 19th hole as he
   contemplates the prospect of turning the gavel back over to Nancy
   Pelosi in 19 months.

   JEERS to what your government spies with their little eyes.  Blogger
   Glenn Greenwald has shaken the nation with his [35]revelation that the
   attacks of 9/11 prompted members of Congress to leap into action, flex
   the withered remnants of their aged biceps, and allow a giant hose to
   be connected from your communications devices to the Borg-like entity
   known as the NSA which, in turn, sucks on your data like Dick Morris
   sucking on a hooker's tootsies.  This development is absolutely
   shocking, folks.  I have rarely seen anything like this.  The nation is
   actually listening to a blogger!

   CHEERS to pissing on the King.  On today's date in 1775, "United
   States" was chosen to replace "United Colonies" as our official name
   (beating "Bubbaland" by one vote---Pinckney's, of course, that
   bastard).  By the way, if you need some parchment at bargain basement
   prices, there's still ten thousand boxes of "United Colonies"
   stationery in the Independence Hall supply closet.  Thanks for the
   heads-up, management.  :-(

   CHEERS to a gathering of overlords.  Everybody be on your best behavior
   this weekend---[36]we got company:
   Chinese bullet tran
   Maybe Xi can tell Obama how
   to get some 'o these built here.

     Trade deals, cybercrime and North Korea will likely be at the top of
     the agenda when President Barack Obama spends two days with Chinese
     President Xi Jinping at a 200-acre California estate popular among
     international leaders looking for a quiet place to hash out the
     future of the world in private.

   Yes.  Because if the future of the 4.5 billion-year-old world is going
   to be hashed out, it should definitely be hashed out in private by two
   adversaries inside a walled compound surrounded by an army of security
   guards whose job is to keep the world out.  Hey, Gingrich!  How's that
   moon colony coming along?
   Tom DeLay mugshot
   Convicted Felon.
   CHEERS to proud moments in American history.  One day, years from
   now---or maybe even this Sunday---you'll be bouncing your grandchild on
   your knee.  And that sweet little tot will turn to you and say, "Why is
   June 9th such a special day?"  And you'll look down into those sweet
   innocent eyes and say, "That was the day in 2006 when Tom DeLay went to
   work in Congress [37]for the very last time.  And then you'll go into
   the kitchen for Oreos and milk.  Because that's the kind of awesome
   grandparent you are.
   Holland Taylor as Ann Richards.
   Win that Tony!
   -
   CHEERS to home vegetation.  The big TV event this weekend is the season
   finale of [38]Game of Thrones, and here's a SPOILER ALERT: everybody
   dies except a goat and a dragon who fall in love at a bar and raise a
   happy family of goat-dragons and a wacky maid named Alice.  You read it
   here first.  What else?  Well, on HBO's [39]Real Time, Bill Maher talks
   with Kevin Williamson, Ana Navarro, George Packer, Dana Gould and Tom
   Shadyac.  New DVD releases include the Melissa McCarthy comedy Identity
   Thief and the re-boot of the Die Hard franchise that attracted a
   stampede of approximately three pairs of boots to theatres.  Your MLB,
   NBA and NHL schedules can be found [40]here, [41]here and [42]here.
   (The #1 Red Sox will "bedevil" the Angels Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!)  On [43]60
   Minutes: Justice Sonia Sotomayor!  And the [44]Tony Awards are Sunday,
   hosted by Neil Patrick Harris---gonna be a big night for Harvey
   Fierstein and Cyndi Lauper ("Kinky Boots"), and I'd love to see Holland
   Taylor win for her one-woman show as Texas Governor Ann Richards.

   On [45]Bill Moyers & Company, I hope economist Richard Wolff remembers
   to wish Bill a happy birthday (#79).  And here's your Sunday morning
   lineup, now with C&J's EXCLUSIVE Lefty-Righty (L-R) Index.  Let's see
   if it's even more lopsided than usual:

     Meet the Press: Oh my god!  It's perfect parity this week!!!  Mostly
     because Meet the Press isn't airing this week.  Thank you,
     cheeser-eating surrender monkey tennis tournament!!!  L-R Index: 0-0

   Cartoon - Batemanimation: McCain vs Citizens United by Scott Bateman
   Sunday morning it's CNN's
   turn to babysit McCain.
   -

     This Week: Intelligence Committee chairs Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA)
     and Mike Rogers (R-MI); Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) on how she lost
     her war against the Obama administration in a rout so spectacular
     that quitting her 2014 re-election race was her only viable option;
     roundtable with Paul Krugman, George Will, Matt Dowd, Rep. Keith
     Ellison (D-MN) and Fox News' Greta van Susteren.  L-R Index: 3-5

     Face the Nation: Discussion of sexual assaults in the military with
     Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and Rep.
     Jackie Speier (D-CA); Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), and Rep. Elijah
     Cummings (D-MD); Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) on being the
     longest-serving congressman ever.  L-R Index: 4-2

     CNN's State of the Union: This week it's Candy Crowley's turn to
     babysit John McCain while Cindy goes shopping.  Plus: Sen. Mark
     Udall (D-CO) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), and former Reps.
     Robert Wexler (D-FL) and Tom Davis (R-VA).  L-R Index: 3-2

     Fox GOP Talking Points Sunday: Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY); roundtable
     woth Bill kristol, Peter Baker, Mary Matalin and Mara Liasson.  L-R
     Index: 0-3

   Lefty-Righty total for the week: 10-12...about as close to parity as
   they'll ever get  Happy sleeping in!

   Five years ago in C&J: June 7, 2008
   Decisions, decisions...
   JEERS to a new subsidiary of Bullshit, Inc.  If you liked Swift Boat
   Veterans for Truth, you'll LOVE [46]Parents for Truth!  It's the latest
   fantasy from the National Abstinence Education Association which
   appears to be dedicated to doing everything in its power to increase
   unsafe sex in America by making abstinence really, really uncool:

     There is very little that is truthful about this "Parents for Truth"
     campaign. Not only is it pushing misleading, [47]discredited claims
     about abstinence-only education, but the entire effort appears to be
     run by unethical individuals with strong ties in the anti-gay
     movement.

   Although maybe they're onto something.  Horny kids can resist their
   urge to go zipper diving by going to the group's [48]website (which, by
   the way, includes one "success story").  Their libidos will be numb
   before they reach second base.

   -

   And just one more...

   CHEERS to unsolved mysteries...SOLVED!!!  If you ever want to start a
   knock-down, drag-out brawl, just refer to a sweetened carbonated
   beverage by the wrong name in the wrong region.  I don't know why, but
   referring to soda in a pop region, or pop in a soda region, or pop or
   soda in a coke region, brings out the barbarian-with-spiked-club in us.
    So, in the interest of promoting peace among the krazy straw crowd, a
   North Carolina State graduate student has [49]mapped out the regions so
   you'll know what to call it when you belly up to the counter:
   Regional graph of where people refer to carbonated sweet beverages as
   soda, pop or coke.
   Of course, pancreases across the country are 100 percent unified in
   what they call it: punishment.

   Have a sweet fizzy weekend!  Floor's open...What are you cheering and
   jeering about today?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [63]Tagging tips - [64]Search For Tags - [65]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [66]Civil
   Rights, [67]Community, [68]Congress, [69]Culture, [70]Economy,
   [71]Education, [72]Elections, [73]Energy, [74]Environment, [75]Health
   Care, [76]International, [77]Labor, [78]Law, [79]Media, [80]Meta,
   [81]National Security, [82]Science, [83]Transportation, or [84]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([85]California, [86]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Over the past year or so, craft brewers have started putting the
       good stuff in cans--blame Colorado. (Oskar Blues started it, IIRC.)
       So while the recession probably had an impact, the cool kids did,
       too.

   Cheers to being in Maine.

   Cheers to puttering. Nice to get lots of little things done!

   Cheers to my little town here in the hills of western Maine seeming to
   have a nice little renaissance. Quilt shop moved to a nice location on
   Main St. from a less convenient location in a nearby town, book shop
   still going, yarn shop bought by people committed to Main St., as they
   already run a cafe down the street (and now the shop sells wine as well
   as yarn....). Looking better than it has since I was in high school.

   Cheers to all the usual stuff: good friends, beautiful sunny days,
   knitting and sewing that does what I want it to, books that keep me up
   later than I should be, Pinterest/Facebook/Words with Friends (those
   wonderful cities in Procasti-Nation), well-written fanfiction......
   Yup, life is pretty good ;-)

   Cheers to the wee beasties. They are enjoying being here as well....

       I'm once again hosting a meet-up at The Point on Saturday, July 6,
       11:30 to 5:30 (approximately......very approximately) in western
       Maine (about a scenic hour drive northwest from Portland).
       Same deal as previous years:
       I'll gladly cook and have beer/non-alcoholic beverages.
       Lake should be warm enough for fun if anyone wants.
       Dogs (well-behaved! which definitely includes the adorable Haley
       and her Commonmass-aimed sticks... {grin}...) welcome, but Hobbs
       and Penn prefer to be the only kitties ;-)
       Pictures to entice anyone debating joining us are [278]here.
       Can't promise the weather will be like this (it is Maine, after
       all...), but it is more than possible:
       [279]View from dock
       If anyone wants to spend Friday and/or Saturday night (for fun, or
       because it's a long drive.....), I've got room for several, plus
       some tenting space.  For more information/exact directions or to
       RSVP, email me at killearnan at gmail.com or send a Kosmail.

   ......and finally, for a song of the week ............... he never made
   it big during the folk revival of the early 1960's - or, as he put it,
   "the Folk Scare of the 1960's" - as he was not a prolific songwriter
   (when one was expected to write their own material), his voice was
   gruff and he was overweight ... but [356]Dave Van Ronk was everybody's
   friend in Greenwich Village from the mid-50's on. He crashed at others'
   places (or returned the favor), befriended Tom Paxton and Phil Ochs,
   and helped mentor the young and newly-arrived Bob Dylan and Joni
   Mitchell. Not for nothing was he known as "The Mayor of MacDougal
   Street".

   The Brooklyn native grew up in [357]Richmond Hill, Queens and always
   described himself as "more Irish than Dutch" - with a stoneware jug of
   [358]Tullamore Dew whiskey on-stage with him. A high school dropout, he
   began bringing his guitar into Greenwich Village's noted hangout
   Washington Square Park ... until as he noted, it was "overtaken by the
   bongo players". As noted in his memoirs, he scrounged for meals and
   board, eventually joining the merchant marines in order to earn a
   nest-egg.

   While he is remembered as a folkie, he pointed out that he learned (and
   performed) with [359]Dixieland jazz bands in the 1950's and - while
   that style faded in Manhattan during the decade - it remained a
   valuable part of his sound. Eventually settling-in as a solo performer,
   he adapted ragtime tunes to the guitar, and also became a devotee of
   Kurt Weill, and of Woody Guthrie and traditional folk tunes.

   But it is fair to say that his music is more based upon the blues than
   any other style, adapting the songs of Leadbelly, Mississippi John Hurt
   and especially the Reverend Gary Davis. In the 1950's, few white
   musicians were playing these tunes, which made his adaptations stand
   out. And so songs such as "12 Gates to the City" and "Cocaine Blues" -
   which the Rev. Gary Davis eventually stopped playing to focus on
   religious music - became a Van Ronk standard. He also performed songs
   by the young musicians he helped out, such as Bob Dylan's "If I Had to
   Do It All Over Again", and Joni Mitchell's "Chelsea Morning", and
   eventually began writing some of his own songs ("Sunday Street" and
   "Gaslight Rag"). But that came too late in his career to help him join
   the burgeoning singer-songwriter movement.

   After trying to scrape out a living in the mid-50's New York
   coffeehouse scene - still a few years away from the explosion - Van
   Ronk talks about hearing encouraging words from the folksinger Odetta,
   who promised to bring a tape to tell the Chicago club owner Albert
   Grossman about Van Ronk. Van Ronk then ventured to Chicago to audition
   for Grossman at his famous [360]Gate of Horn - but who never received
   the tape and was unimpressed, anyway.

   His career began in earnest with his 1959 release on Moe Asch's
   legendary [361]Folkways Records label - which he felt was more
   authentically folk music than, say, the Kingston Trio (whom he
   disliked) - and his [362]first album garnered some notice. But he had
   more success in the 1960's when he was signed to [363]Prestige Records
   - the jazz label owned by the legendary producer [364]Bob Weinstock -
   when it opened itself to folk music in the early 1960's, with much
   better distribution channels. They released perhaps his most noted solo
   album - [365]Dave Van Ronk, Folksinger - in 1963. Just a few years
   earlier, that great "folk scare" had finally arrived, years after it
   was forecast. Van Ronk was largely overlooked by it, [366]later saying:

     If there was ever any truth to the trickle-down theory, the only
     evidence of it I've ever seen was in that period of 1960 to 1965.
     All of sudden they were handing out major label recording contracts
     like they were coming in Cracker Jack boxes.

   But it almost didn't pass him by: Albert Grossman - by then, Bob
   Dylan's manager - had grown fonder of Van Ronk's singing and asked if
   he was interested in joining the trio he was forming. And when Van Ronk
   declined, it was Paul Stookey who became the third partner in
   [367]Peter, Paul & Mary - which Van Ronk realized he would have been
   horribly suited for .... yet from time-to-time pondered his bank
   balance and wondered .....

   His wonderful memoirs are entitled [368]The Mayor of MacDougal Street -
   completed by its ghostwriter after his death - and only continue until
   the end of the 1960's, as he wanted less of a true bio, and more of the
   'end of an era' accounting. It turns out that he had come out of the
   old [369]Lions Head Pub to see what the loud commotion he heard was
   about ... and wound up in the middle of the [370]Stonewall Riots of
   1969.

   But though his time in the limelight had faded, his career lasted
   another thirty years, recording over thirty albums and now mentoring a
   new group of musicians (with The Roches and [371]Christine Lavin in
   particular). And he supported left-wing politics all his life ... just
   not via songwriting (as he felt that Phil Ochs had pigeon-holed himself
   needlessly). And when you listen to the early acoustic Hot Tuna
   recordings, you hear many songs that Dave Van Ronk had popularized a
   few years earlier.

   Dave Van Ronk [372]died in February, 2002 at the age of 62, after
   battling colon cancer. A few months later, a live recording of his
   [373]last concert was released.

   His legacy includes an ASCAP Lifetime Achievement Award (in 1997), a
   two-disc [374]compilation album and part of Sheridan Square in
   Greenwich Village renamed [375]Dave Van Ronk Street in June, 2004.

   And it may extend further yet: as the Coen Brothers filmmakers are
   planning to release a feature film (perhaps this year) entitled
   [376]Inside Llyewn Davis .... which is largely based upon the life of
   Dave Van Ronk.

      [377][DVR1_zpsd38ec74b.jpg]  [378] [DVR2_zpsd9cc283c.jpg]  [379]
                           [DVR3_zpsc83677d8.jpg]

   Of all of his songs, it is a traditional tune (naturally) with its own
   interesting heritage called [380]Hesitation Blues - also performed by
   musicians ranging from W.C. Handy to Janis Joplin to Willie Nelson to
   Doc & Merle Watson - that is my favorite. And [381]below you can listen
   to it.

       I know electric blues/rock brings in the bucks, but acoustic is
       where Hot Tuna belongs.
       Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the
       fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first
       existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the
       higher consideration. -- [DEL: K.Marx :DEL] A.Lincoln

   Well, there's rain. Lots of it. So what are you all doing with your
   day? I painted my nails. Thank goodness nail polish keeps!

   Cheers to purple nails, even if they're very short. OPI Ink is one of
   my very favorites.

   Jeers to cold, rainy days. But they make hot tea taste good, and chai
   is so spicy-sweet with honey & rum!

   Cheers to good doctors. I've always known that the fibro diagnosis I
   had didn't come near to answering all the questions about my health,
   but most of the drs I had shoved the other issues into the 'your mother
   did drugs' wastebasket. Well, it looks like I don't have fibro. We
   can't get the genetic testing done, but with my medical history, my
   doctor is pretty damn certain that I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, most
   likely hypermobility type. But with vascular involvement. Thank
   goodness I was already on BP meds to curb nightmares, otherwise I'd be
   having nightmares about the possibilities. I'll be set up with full
   vascular testing as soon as SSI (and therefor Medicare) comes through.
   Thanks, HBIII, for posting that research. /hugs

   Cheers to my cousin, who does his best to help me out.

   Jeers to housing falling through.

   Thank you to whoever has sent me a Pootie Pad. I've not been able to
   pick it up, but I got a KosMail saying that it should be there. You're
   too sweet! Pùka deserves to be spoiled. :)

   And I've filed for divorce. I wish it could be different, but my safety
   has to come first. I do hope that Sarah actually gets help, but that's

       Except for what I can't get right now. I'm lucky that my doctor
       sees me, but he can't force specialists to, or order lovely,
       full-body scans without payment! Heh. He did step up my appointment
       schedule--usually I'd be going in the beginning of October, but now
       it's beginning of August.
       Well, it's better to know about the risks, than to walk around and

   One and all!

   It's a great evening to be alive!

   ...and for those of you I pissed off with my 'I'm in yer Sisters, OR'
   jokes last week, perhaps you'll feel better knowing I'm now in Eugene!
   Yes, in Eugene. Skinner.

   I have nothing to add to Fletcher & lil Chris' MEGA JEERS:
   Ultimate JEERS to leash laws.
   Woof?
   exactly.

   Ok, I'll add: We're having a blast-those of us not leashed-and we were
   running freely in the Deschutes Nat. Forest before we crossed the mtns
   into the Willamette Valley/Leashville.
   Fletch wants you to know we're not in Lane County...we're in Lame
   County. woof.

       if ya play yer cards right...er, I mean, no--I'm in Eugene, Oregon.
       Land of the leash law. Which is cool & I understand an all, but
       Fletch & Chris are not hip to the tied up thing at all. It clashes
       with their lifestyle.
       The pups loved Bend/ Sisters, as it is like home--open running in
       the vast open high desert. And there is a ton of cool mtns & trails
       & forested areas to run in there. Wide open spaces. We woulda
       stayed but there was a rodeo ya see, and, well, never mind.
       So far our vote is for(in this order): Central Oregon, eastern
       Oregon, then the central/Willamette Valley. We have high hopes for
       the coast next week. I guess I've become a small town guy. The 150k
       people in Eugene is too many. Cars everywhere, semi-homeless
       beggars at too many intersections, just too much. I guess I need
       solitude. With a mate though. Applications still open. Act now!

   From his speech today at a DNC event in L.A.:

     "But I have to say that right now the nature of the Republican Party
     makes it very difficult for them to engage in common-sense
     discussions around solving problems.  And all of you see it.  I
     don't have to spell it out for you.  But within their ranks there is
     a tendency to believe that compromise is a dirty word and that
     government is something to be torn down, as opposed to something to
     be embraced as a facilitator for the private sector and ordinary
     citizens to be able to achieve their dreams.
     And so what that means is, is that I will get a lot more done with a
     Democratic House, and I sure need to keep a Democratic Senate."

   I may post a diary on it shortly...

   Hope all are well! :)

   I cH President Barack Obama.

       I remember a "60 Minutes" interview with Eric Cantor, who kept on
       interpreting the word "compromise" to mean surrendering his moral
       values.  Such a jackass, since he knows darn well that "compromise"
       in political terms means nuts-and-bolts stuff...mostly involving
       numbers.
       It's just criminal how they're behaving.  If ya don't like running
       the government, Cantor, get the hell out and hit the links.

   Our rain gauge tops off at 5 inches; it's overflowing.  Everyplace the
   contractors worked is a sea of mud and concrete chunks and floating
   junk, with their tools all here and there.  They filled in some holes
   before they left, but not real firmly; I stepped into what looked like
   solid ground and went into mud to my knees.  I had to dig my shoes out.
    They might recover.  Then into the house, dripping mud.  Oh, I am not
   happy - they could at least have put boards down for us to walk on.

   The roses are wet tissue, the garden is flooded, and we're having a

   another household improvement, on the path to making the house ready to
   sell as needed.

   Over the course of the last 4 or 5 days, I cleaned out our dilapidated
   'flower bed' out front that only ever had an old boxwood and briefly
   each year, a straggly array of tulips at one end... and a lot of feral
   cat droppings.  With giftcards and cash I got for graduation, I picked
   up 4 smaller holly bushes, 5 purple spotted 'heucheras' that are
   supposed to be perennials, a bunch of white marble chips, and a smaller
   amount of black lava rock.  Moved the ends of the bed in, planted the
   holly and heucheras, surrounded them all with the marble, then redid
   the old ends with the black lava rock.

   Dad also gave me a new door for graduation, since our front door has
   been broken and unusable for something like 8 months to a year now, and
   we've been going in and out of the house through the attached garage or
   the back door.  So the new door will be installed in the next week or
   so, and we'll finally be able to use the front door again like normal
   people :P

       Part of the reason that 'flower bed' was so pitiful is that it's on
       the north side of the house and under a sugar maple, so most of the
       day, there's no direct sun on any of it, and none of the things
       we'd tried there in past years have survived.  I'm willing to do
       extra waterings for a while, but if they die off on me, they'll
       only be replaced if/when we do decide to try to sell.

   CHEERS  Glenn's gotten two days of interest in this story (that's
   remarkable for the 15 second attention span of most of the population).
    There was another story today with additional potential for scandal
   worldwide (may it be so, please FSM):

     [1697]Obama orders US to draw up overseas target list for
     cyber-attacks
     Exclusive: Top-secret directive steps up offensive cyber
     capabilities to 'advance US objectives around the world'
     [1698]Read the secret presidential directive here
     [This one is 18 pages.]

   I see this as the US leader(s) being able to say "Lookee-see-here,
   we're the dictators of the world now.  Do as we say or we'll zap you
   off the internet grid."

   I think the US will end up being despised by a lot of people in the
   world over yesterday's and today's news that only came from Greenwald
   alone.  [I wonder how the gub-mint will smear his name now....]

   Hip, hip, hooray!  Hip, hip, hooray!  Hip, hip, hooray to Glenn
   Greenwald!!!

   This is all that's been on my mind because I'm so grateful someone is
   finally paying attention.

       ... those old larger-than-life spectacular movies - Esther Williams
       movies included - on Sat. & Sun. afternoons on TV ... before sports
       invaded weekend television.  It was at that point that I turned off
       my TV most weekends.  For a while there were Sat. and/or Sun. night
       at the movies and/or miniseries on weekends..., but that all quit
       at least a decade ago, so my weekend TV viewing went to zero.
       Now what little TV viewing I do is mostly on Hulu.  For the summer
       there's Stewart/his replacement, Colbert, Rookie Blue, and a new
       show that's medium okay called Motive.
       Before that it was Stewart, Colbert, and something like six or
       eight other shows sometimes (altho I was horribly annoyed when
       there was a spate of nothing but reruns for a while not long before
       the spring cliffhangers of each series and I never figured out
       why).
       Still, TV isn't interesting enough to watch much.  Or, I can go to
       my small, but interesting and eclectic collection of old movies on
       DVD and watch those.
       I get more fun watching old BBC series or Britcoms on YouTube...,
       mostly ad-free!
       OTOH, my formative years were when there was no television at all;
       we didn't get one until I was around maybe 12/13 years old.  I
       remember watching American Bandstand after school when it wasn't
       too fuzzy.  My primary mind-filler was, and remains, books, which
       is how I ended up at age 67 with the largest private library of
       anyone I know.
       I can deal with quiet solitude rather nicely, and I don't need
       noise in the background to keep my mind busy.

       That, ladies and gents, is one ugly divorce.

     * The Pacers. So close! SO CLOSE!
     * Turkish Prime Minister Ergodan, who's now facing his own home-grown
       Occupy/Spring movement. So inconveniently timed, too, with the US

       that.

     * Illinois Gay Marriage Proponents, who ended up having to delay the
       bill until the autumn after [1823]supporters weren't able to get

       coach [1825]had his contract renewed. How's that for
       boys-will-be-boys?)

       biracial couple in a Cheerios ad, but, no doubt, by Spanish music
       in a Target ad. Will their agony never cease? Can we hope it won't?

       I had to explain why to the poor instructor. That evangelicals
       think meditating is worshiping Satan (she had called us Satanists
       as she left). He was distraught, and wanted to follow her and

       kids even talked about yoga. Because it's "against Jesus" and makes
       God cry.

       If talking about yoga makes her god cry........what a wuss!!
       What, no smiting?  No plague of boils??  No...fire and brimstone???
        I'll tell ya, her god is slippin' on the ol' retribution thing.
       And if yoga makes God cry, just think what the R's are doing to
       him!
       Good thing I don't believe in that god, isn't it?  Mine's a more
       mellow God, who appreciates the calm reflection and healthy
       humanity of yoga.
       Wonder what else her kids can't talk about?

   I voted for Greenwald et al, but now I'm afraid to say why....

   Jeers to the likely chilling of free speech and political discourse.
   And continued jeers to the rising tide of bully culture. Mega CHEERS
   that it doesn't exist in the kiddie pool.

   Cheers to creativity in the world...cheers to people coming to the
   rescue of other people (and animals).

   Cheers to conversations that go everywhere. One of my team sent a group
   email to another team in the company, and used a couple of creative
   terms to describe the people reporting to her. I followed with an email
   that said something like "this sounds like Cowboys vs Aliens...a film
   about which I know nothing except that it features a song that has my
   name in it." Next thing I knew, I was deep in a conversation about folk
   music and DFH (as my dad would have called them), and off to the
   wonders of Pete Seeger and Joan Baez....and misogyny and what not. I
   love conversations like that.

   Jeers to people who contribute lazily to projects. Another coworker,
   assigned to research rum (you knew there was a C&J tie here, right?)
   informed us that rum was tasteless, except for a bit of vanilla and
   spice, unless it was a spiced rum. I told him he might want to try
   drinking better rum. He looked displeased at my input, at which point
   my boss suggested which one he should try: my favorite! (Ah, the joys
   of Barbancourt 15).

   Cheers to my wi-fi finally kicking in. As I posted on FB 10 minutes
   ago: my screen shows that I have no internet connectivity...and yet,
   here I am. The little wet-floor sign has finally disappeared. Such a
   relief. (snark)

   That's about all I've got, kiddies. Cheers to face to face meetups,
   wandering the country, the freedoms that seem to be more imperiled
   every day (no cheers to the imperiling, of course)...including two of
   my favorites, those in the 1st and the 4th.

   Cheers to work, and the copy editing that WILL take up the rest of my
   weekend (wish me luck and speedy typing! It's not a bad edit, but it's
   a ton of small things, so it's time consuming.)....

   And cheers to those of you dealing with TS Andrea as she continues HER
   travels up the coast...stay safe and sane!

   CHEERS to a good job interview this week. There were nervous grins when
   I mentioned that one of my references was also one of my interviewers.
   Decision is supposed to come down next week.

   JEERS to the Boston Bruins, stomping the hell out of my Penguins.
   Interestingly (or not), if the Bruins finish off the Pens, I'll be
   cheering for them against the Black Hawks or Kings.

   JEERS to all this FISA, spying, data mining shit. Bad enough when a

   Cheers for being on a dragon boat team with coworkers for the races

   Cheers for having co-worker back from her marriage trip. I'd like to

 Well, you know, I think I'm getting used to wine ([2119]10+ / 0-)

   in a fancy bottle. If it slips out of your hand while you're swigging
   it and lands on the floor, it doesn't break because it's PLASTIC!

   And if you're quick enough, you can slap the screw top back on before
   it all drains out and you have to lap it up from the tile like a dog.

   But I'm still keeping several box wines in reserve in case this doesn't
   work out, or if for some reason the bottle runs dry before 6:30 pm.

   Oh crap.

   I went to see the Doc to get my BP med updated. While I was there I
   asked him to give me a new script for a skin cream, I thought he would
   say no, go see your dermo doc, but instead he wrote the script for both
   meds. That saved me $85 in a co-pay.

   The other day, the nightly Daily Kos wrapup had a quote from C&J a few
   years ago. I went and read it again, and it had something like 586
   comments. I'm only seeing 112 right now. Come on, folks, yak it up!

   Cheers to Da Broons and Da Sox. Who'da thunk they'd be on top of their
   game in June?

   Cheers to this work week being over. I've been on a high-speed
   treadmill at work for a while now.

   Cheers to AtheO, aka theson^TM, who is having job interviews. Maybe
   we'll be able to stop hearing him whine about his current boss.

   Cheers to the Great State of Maine, to which we hope to drive up
   tomorrow. Not enough visits yet, but we'll be there most of July.

       Yeah, the days of 500-600 comments are gone.  I was always floored
       by that response.  But today I would never have time to read that
       many.
       It's usually a little over 200 these days.  That's a good number, I
       think.
       Safe travels.  The rain should be gone by late morning.

       Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the
       fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first
       existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the
       higher consideration. -- [DEL: K.Marx :DEL] A.Lincoln
