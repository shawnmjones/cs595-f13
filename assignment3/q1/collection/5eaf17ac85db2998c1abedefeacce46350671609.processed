   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Authorities ask federal and state agents to help identify two
       men seen in photos
     * NEW: The men are of "high interest" in the probe into the Boston
       Marathon blasts
     * NEW: One of the men is seen in photos carrying a black backpack, an
       official says
     * 3 people were killed and about 180 injured when 2 bombs went off
       near the finish line

   (CNN) -- Investigators have pinpointed two men as "possible suspects"
   who were seen in images near the finish line of this week's Boston
   Marathon -- moments before twin bombs there exploded, killing three and
   injuring about 180 others -- a law enforcement official said.

   A circular sent out Wednesday to federal and state agencies features
   the photos "in an attempt to identify the individuals," who were
   described as being of "high interest" to investigators.

   One of the men is seen carrying a black backpack. An FBI official
   earlier said that authorities believe the bombs were placed inside a
   black nylon backpack or bag.

   The source said that authorities had not yet identified the two men by
   name and that the photographs were not being released to the public for
   fear of impeding the investigation.

   Earlier Wednesday, two official sources with knowledge of the
   investigation identified a man -- who also hasn't been named -- as a
   possible suspect in the attack.

   Seen on a video, this man wore a white baseball cap. One of the sources
   added that the cap was on backwards and the man was also wearing a
   light-colored hooded sweatshirt and a black jacket.

   It was not immediately known if this man is one of those alluded to in
   the photographs distributed to law enforcement officials.

   This movement in the investigation came two days after the horrific
   blast shook the city, during what is traditionally one of its biggest
   and most beloved events each year.

   By Wednesday, authorities had made "significant progress" in the case
   but no arrests, a federal law enforcement source told CNN's John King.

   Sources previously told CNN that a suspect was in custody, but both
   Boston police and the FBI denied that any arrests had been made.

   Source: Bomb was in pressure cooker
   Tracking suspects in the Boston bombings

   A Boston law enforcement source told CNN, "We got him," but wouldn't
   clarify whether that meant a suspect has been identified or arrested.
   Some federal sources said it was even too early to say investigators
   had identified the suspect, but several sources in Boston told CNN that
   they have a clear identification.

   Speaking on CNN's The Situation Room, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick
   said investigators were closer to cracking the case "every hour." But
   he urged patience with the probe.

   "What I would say and I would ask of everyone is we give law
   enforcement the space to do their work," Patrick said. "When they are
   ready with a complete picture, they will tell us what that picture is."

   He added, "I wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of
   this catastrophe, but I understand from experience it's going to take
   some time."

   Earlier Wednesday, investigators revealed more details about the makeup
   of the bombs, which exploded 12 seconds apart. One had been housed in a
   pressure cooker hidden inside a backpack, the FBI said in a joint
   intelligence bulletin. The device also had fragments that may have
   included nails, BBs and ball bearings, the agency said.

   The lid of a pressure cooker thought to be used in the device was found
   on a rooftop at the scene, a federal law enforcement official with
   firsthand knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

   The second bomb was also housed in a metal container, but it was not
   clear whether it too was in a pressure cooker, the FBI said.

   The U.S. government has warned federal agencies in the past that
   terrorists could turn pressure cookers into bombs by packing them with
   explosives and shrapnel and detonating them with blasting caps.

   Photos: Deadly attack at Boston Marathon Photos: Deadly attack at
   Boston Marathon

   The bombs

   Photos obtained by CNN show the remains of a pressure cooker found at
   the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be
   metal pellets or ball bearings. Scraps of at least one pressure cooker,
   nails and nylon bags found at the scene were sent to the FBI's national
   laboratory in Virginia, where technicians will try to reconstruct the
   devices, the agent leading the investigation said Tuesday.

   The pieces suggest each of the devices was 6 liters (about 1.6 gallons)
   in volume, a Boston law enforcement source said. The recovered parts
   include part of a circuit board, which might have been used to detonate
   a device.

   A law enforcement official said Monday's bombs were probably detonated
   by timers. But the FBI said details of the detonating system were
   unknown.

   While the clues moved the investigation forward, they did not make it
   immediately apparent whether the attack was an act of domestic or
   foreign terrorism.

   "If your experience and your expertise is Middle East terrorism, it has
   the hallmarks of al Qaeda or a Middle East group," former FBI Assistant
   Director Tom Fuentes said. "If your experience is domestic groups and
   bombings that have occurred here, it has the hallmarks of a domestic
   terrorist like Eric Rudolph in the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics
   bombings."

   Boston doctor: 'Everyone was my patient'
   Remembering 8-year-old Martin Richard

   [41]Things we know

   Fuentes said he has investigated both types of terrorism -- from Iraq
   to the United States -- and finds the Boston attack has elements of
   both. "It has the hallmarks of both domestic and international
   (attacks), and you can see either side of that."

   [42]Opinion: Why is this so rare?

   Third victim identified

   Boston University identified graduate student Lingzi Lu as the third
   person who died in Monday's bombings.

   Previously identified were Krystle Campbell, 29, of Arlington,
   Massachusetts, and Martin Richard, 8, of Dorchester, Massachusetts.

   "She was the best," Campbell's distraught mother, Patty, told reporters
   Tuesday. "You couldn't ask for a better daughter."

   Martin "was a bright, energetic young boy who had big dreams and high
   hopes for his future," his school said in a statement. "We are
   heartbroken by this loss."

   The hunt for the attacker

   The attack left Boston police with "the most complex crime scene that
   we've dealt with in the history of our department," Commissioner Ed
   Davis said Tuesday.

   Authorities sifted through thousands of pieces of evidence and a mass
   of digital photos and video clips. They have pleaded for the public's
   help in providing additional leads and images.

   "Someone knows who did this," said Rick DesLauriers, the special agent
   in charge of the FBI's Boston office, said. "The community will play a
   crucial role in this investigation."

   Medical personnel treating the wounded found evidence suggesting the
   bomb maker or bomb makers sought to maximize the suffering.

   Dr. George Velmahos, head of trauma care at Massachusetts General
   Hospital, said his team found "numerous" metal pellets and nails inside
   patients' bodies.

   "There are people who have 10, 20, 30, 40 of them in their body, or
   more," Velmahos said.

   [43]'Human spirit' still alive

   Dr. Ron Walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type
   nails.

   "There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the
   device for the purpose of being exploded forward," he said.

   Victims continue recovery

   As investigators continued to search for a suspect, those wounded in
   the incident continued to recover.

   Boston-area hospitals had released at least 112 of the 178 people
   injured in the attack, according to CNN's tally late Wednesday. Of the
   66 people who were still hospitalized, 13 were in critical condition.

   Boston Medical Center has two patients in critical condition, down from
   11 just after the bombings, Dr. Peter Burke, chief of trauma care, told
   reporters Wednesday. Ten patients are in serious condition and seven
   are in fair condition, he said.

   Spectator Steve Byrne was standing with a group of friends near a
   mailbox when the second blast went off. Now his face is scarred with
   shrapnel wounds. A BB pellet remains lodged in his neck. Doctors said
   they couldn't remove it because was too close to nerves that control
   his vision, but he was out of the hospital on Wednesday.

   Compared to how his friends are suffering, he told CNN's AC360 that he
   feels lucky.

   Four out of the five friends he was watching the marathon with have
   lost limbs, he said. One friend had 70 nails in his leg.

   He remembers the explosion in vivid detail: the blast that was so
   strong that it burned his clothes off; the carnage around him; and the
   haunting, slow-motion daze of searching for his friends.

   "We were having a great day and waiting to see our friend cross the
   finish line," he said, "and then all of the sudden it turned in a
   flash."

   He told CNN he's worried about the financial burdens his friends could
   face as a result of the explosion.

   One friend is a carpenter and "both his hands are incinerated. He can't
   go to work, and the bills keep coming in."

   "It's not just the hospitals. It's everyday life that doesn't stop. ...
   We're just hoping the mayor, the governor, President Obama don't let us
   as citizens down."

   Beyond those seriously wounded, the incident affected thousands,
   including Candace Rispoli, who was cheering on a friend when the
   festive atmosphere turned into a "terrifying hell." She suffered minor
   injuries.

   "I personally will never participate in an event of this nature in a
   city in [44]fear that something like this could happen again," she
   said. "I keep replaying the moments of terror over and over in my head
   and am just still in utter shock. Always seeing terrible things of this
   nature happen all over the world on TV, my heart would always go out to
   those directly affected. But I never imagined in a million years I
   would be a spectator at the Boston Marathon running for my life."

   CNN's Susan Candiotti, Fran Townsend, Matt Smith, Dave Alsup, Henry
   Hanks, Rande Iaboni, Gloria Borger and John King contributed to this
   report.
