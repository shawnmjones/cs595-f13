     * See if you can [38]crack the code--or should I say the whistle--on
       "isn't what it used to be." (And kudos to Coach Wittleder for
       recognizing this move for what it was.):

     A baseball game between two Chicago public high schools was canceled
     Saturday when some parents from a North Side school refused to let
     their children travel to the South Side for the game, saying they
     were worried about the safety of their kids. [...]

     Wittleder said one of the Payton parents told the others he grew up
     on the South Side and that the neighborhood around Brooks "isn't
     what it used to be."
     "This is probably one of the most embarrassing moments I've had,"
     said Wittleder, who has coached high school baseball for 10 seasons
     and is in his second year as Payton's head coach. "It's very
     heartbreaking. This is totally against what I believe in."
     Even without his players, Wittleder went to Brooks and apologized to
     Eagles coach Bryan Street for having to forfeit the game.
     Brooks' baseball fields are also used for youth teams playing in the
     Jackie Robinson West Little League.
     * Up, [39]up, up (well, when the weather clears up a little):

     One World Trade Center already is New York's tallest building.

     And when the last pieces of its spire rise to the roof - weather
     permitting - the 104-floor skyscraper that replaces the fallen twin
     towers will be just feet from becoming the highest in the Western
     Hemisphere. [...]
     Monday's celebration of the reconstructed trade center comes days
     after a grisly reminder of the terror attack that took nearly 3,000
     lives: the discovery of a rusted piece of airplane landing gear
     wedged between a nearby mosque and an apartment building - believed
     to be from one of the hijacked planes that ravaged lower Manhattan.
     * Too much time on their [40]bigoted hands:

     Last night, the student run PRIDE group at University of San Diego
     held an apparently very threatening drag show called 'Supreme Drag
     Superstar' on campus for the second year in a row.

     Catholic students at the school tried to pray it away:

     Speaking on the group's behalf, sophomore Ailsa Tirado points out
     how the drag show advances an ideology that is opposed to natural
     law, and serves to perpetuate moral confusion rather than provide
     true spiritual healing.

     "The University of San Diego is unquestionably being deceitful by
     identifying itself as a Catholic University, while permitting the
     acceptance and promotion of an ideology that is in direct
     contradiction to the Catholic moral teaching and social tradition,"
     the open letter states.

     * More people with too much time on [41]their hands:

     Police tonight revealed tonight that CNN icon Wolf Blitzer was
     target of a hoax Saturday night claiming that he'd been shot at his
     Bethesda home.  Police arrived in force but no Wolf.   He wasn't
     even there as a hologram.  This was latest in this type of "celeb"
     hoax.

     How'd hoaxters do it?  "In the case involving Blitzer, the person or
     people behind the fraud wrote some form of text message, Starks
     said. The message was set up to seem like it was from Blitzer
     himself, and it included his address. It appeared to have been sent
     through a mobile phone company's "relay" system, which is part of an
     arrangement to pass on urgent messages to the police's emergency
     communications center, Starks said. But exactly where the message
     originated remains unclear, he said."
     * In case you missed it, [42]here are President Obama's remarks at
       Saturday's White House Correspondents Dinner--he got some great
       jabs in:
     * Condolences to family [43]and friends:

     Alan Wood, a World War II veteran credited with providing the flag
     in the famous flag-raising on Iwo Jima, has died. He was 90. [...]

     Wood was a 22-year-old Navy officer in charge of communications on a
     landing ship on Iwo Jima's shores Feb. 23, 1945 when a Marine asked
     him for the biggest flag that he could find.
     After five days of fighting to capture the Japanese-held island,
     U.S. forces had managed to scale Mount Suribachi to hoist an
     American flag.
     Wood happened to have a 37-square-foot flag he had found months
     before in a Pearl Harbor Navy depot.
     Five Marines and a Navy Corpsman later raised that flag in a
     stirring moment captured by Associated Press photographer Joe
     Rosenthal.
     Steven Wood says his father was always humbled by his small role in
     the historic moment.

   [56]Tagging tips - [57]Search For Tags - [58]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [59]Civil
   Rights, [60]Community, [61]Congress, [62]Culture, [63]Economy,
   [64]Education, [65]Elections, [66]Energy, [67]Environment, [68]Health
   Care, [69]International, [70]Labor, [71]Law, [72]Media, [73]Meta,
   [74]National Security, [75]Science, [76]Transportation, or [77]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([78]California, [79]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Tidbit:

     Tucked in the body of this Los Angeles Times report is the startling
     revelation of Tsarnaev's attempt to invoke:

     A senior congressional aide said Tsarnaev had asked several times
     for a lawyer, but that request was ignored since he was being
     questioned under the public safety exemption to the Miranda rule.
     The exemption allows defendants to be questioned about imminent
     threats, such as whether other plots are in the works or other
     plotters are on the loose.

     Assuming the accuracy of this report, the news of Tsarnaev
     repeatedly attempting to invoke right to counsel is critically
     important because now not only is the 5th Amendment right to silence
     in play, but so too is the right to counsel under both the 5th and
     6th Amendments. While the two rights are commonly, and mistakenly,
     thought of as one in the same due to the conflation in the language
     of the Miranda warnings, they are actually somewhat distinct rights
     and principles. In fact, there is no explicit right to counsel set
     out in the Fifth at all, it is a creature of implication
     manufactured by the Supreme Court, while the Sixth Amendment does
     have an explicit right to counsel, but it putatively only attaches
     after charging, and is charge specific. Both are critical to
     consideration of the Tsarnaev case; what follows is a long, but
     necessary, discussion of why.

 Gideon v. Wainwright older than Miranda ([138]4+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [139]hester, [140]MTmofo, [141]PSzymeczek, [142]Ishmaelbychoice

   [143]Gideon vs Wainwright

     Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), is a landmark case in
     United States Supreme Court history. In the case, the Supreme Court
     unanimously ruled that state courts are required under the
     Fourteenth Amendment to provide counsel in criminal cases for
     defendants who are unable to afford to pay their own attorneys,
     extending the identical requirement made on the federal government
     under the Sixth Amendment.

   [144]Miranda v. Arizona

     Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), was a landmark decision of
     the United States Supreme Court which passed 5-4. The Court held
     that both inculpatory and exculpatory statements made in response to
     interrogation by a defendant in police custody will be admissible at
     trial only if the prosecution can show that the defendant was
     informed of the right to consult with an attorney before and during
     questioning and of the right against self-incrimination prior to
     questioning by police, and that the defendant not only understood
     these rights, but voluntarily waived them. This had a significant
     impact on law enforcement in the United States, by making what
     became known as the Miranda rights part of routine police procedure
     to ensure that suspects were informed of their rights. The Supreme
     Court decided Miranda with three other consolidated cases: Westover
     v. United States, Vignera v. New York, and California v. Stewart.

     The Miranda warning (often abbreviated to "Miranda," or
     "Mirandizing" a suspect) is the name of the formal warning that is
     required to be given by police in the United States to criminal
     suspects in police custody (or in a custodial situation) before they
     are interrogated, in accordance with the Miranda ruling. Its purpose
     is to ensure the accused is aware of, and reminded of, these rights
     under the U.S. Constitution, and that they know they can invoke them
     at any time during the interview.

     As of the U.S. Supreme Court decision Berghuis v. Thompkins (June 1,
     2010), criminal suspects who are aware of their right to silence and
     to an attorney, but choose not to "unambiguously" invoke them, may
     find any subsequent voluntary statements treated as an implied
     waiver of their rights, and which may be used in evidence.

 Bernie Sanders Proposes Bill to Help End ([148]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [149]PSzymeczek, [150]Ishmaelbychoice

   Veteran Homelessness By 2015

     Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) along with Republican Sen. Richard Burr
     (R-NC) introduced a bill today that would end homelessness among
     military veterans by 2015.
     The bill titled the Homeless Veterans Prevention Act of 2013 is an
     impressive piece of legislation. Despite the fact that veteran
     homelessness has declined by 17% since 2009, there are still 62,000
     homeless veterans in the United States. The bill deals with
     expanding homelessness prevention programs, increasing the
     availability of legal services to homeless vets, keeping homeless
     veteran families together by allowing the VA to house children of
     homeless vets in transitional housing programs, reauthorization of
     employment and housing programs, and it expands eligibility for the
     homeless veterans dental program.

 Please pray ([154]0+ / 0-)

   I would certainly like to encourage as many people to pray as possible.
    If there is an supreme being, and such a being listens, then these
   arbitrary prayers are certainly going to show the need to rid the world
   of these arbitrary people.  I mean you are at school to learn, being
   given a opportunity to observe a different culture, and all you can do
   is pray that other people act exactly like you?  Seems a waste of
   education.  I that is purpose of such schools.  To pretend to educate.
    It wouldn't be so bad but I suppose, like u of phoenix, some of these
   students who pray instead of educating themselves on federal student
   loans and grants.

   And if they are praying it means they are not out there shooting
   innocent people.

       fat chicks), so we shopped for Levi's in the men's department.
       (Always had issues with the waist gapping, since men's bodies
       aren't shaped like women's, aka baby factories on legs.) Guess we
       were "perpetuating moral confusion" when all we were trying to do
       was stay comfortable when hiking.

 why bother "swatting" Wolf rather than John King ([199]2+ / 0-)

     Police tonight revealed tonight that CNN icon Wolf Blitzer was
     target of a hoax Saturday night claiming that he'd been shot at his
     Bethesda home.  Police arrived in force but no Wolf.   He wasn't
     even there as a hologram.  This was latest in this type of "celeb"
     hoax.

    The Guardian newspaper has a short piece on how the group Blondie came
   to record its quasi-disco hit [208]Heart of Glass .... which didn't sit
   well with some, as Debbie Harry explains:

     Clem Burke, our drummer, refused to play the song live at first.
     When it became a hit, he said: "I guess I'll have to."

   "We should pay attention to that man behind the curtain."

       IIRC correctly, commanding officer decided the first flag was too
       small and had a new one raise that he felt was better able to be
       seen. The famous photo was from that second raising. The
       photographer didn't even see the photo until after it was
       published. He took several rolls of film and sent it back to his
       base to be developed.

   And isn't she the one who became Saint Joan?

     Last night, the student run PRIDE group at University of San Diego
     held an apparently very threatening drag show called 'Supreme Drag
     Superstar' on campus for the second year in a row.
      Catholic students at the school tried to pray it away:

   We're all pretty strange one way or another; some of us just hide it
   better. "Normal" is a dryer setting.

 OK, about that Chicago story: ([246]0+ / 0-)

   First off, if somebody's grandparents grew up in Roseland, there might
   still have been some white folks living there at the time. But when
   these kids' parents grew up in Roseland, it was as African-American as
   it is now. The difference is that a generation ago, it was
   African-American and comfortable; now, it's African-American and poor.
   Even that wasn't enough to make me afraid to go there five or ten years
   ago; at that time, there wasn't a neighborhood in the city (except for
   North Lawndale, which gives off a powerful Training Day vibe) where I
   wouldn't feel comfortable walking around by myself during the day. But
   the difference between five or ten years ago and the last couple of
   years, in terms of the amount of gang violence, is dramatic -- and it's
   spread to other parts of the city as well. On the Northwest Side,
   Albany Park, which until recently was practically homicide-free, became
   a minor war zone between 2011 and 2012 as gang members displaced from
   other neighborhoods by gentrification and demolition of public housing
   began moving in. The safer neighborhoods of Chicago are fast becoming
   islands unto themselves. It's as brutal an illustration of the
   inequalities that are consuming both the city and the nation as you
   could ask for.

   "The great lie of democracy, its essential paradox, is that democracy
   is the first to be sacrificed when its security is at risk. Every state
   is totalitarian at heart; there are no ends to the cruelty it will go
   to to protect itself." -- Ian McDonald
