   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Tsarnaev had multiple gunshot wounds, court documents say
     * One wound started inside his mouth and exited his face
     * Tsarnaev was read his Miranda rights on April 22
     * He faces 30 federal charges tied to the April 15 bombing

   (CNN) -- Boston marathon bombing suspect [42]Dzhokhar Tsarnaev suffered
   multiple and severe gunshot injuries before his capture in April, newly
   released court documents show.

   The most serious of the injuries was a gunshot wound that appeared to
   enter through the left inside of his mouth and exit through the lower
   left side of his face, said Stephen Ray Odom, a trauma surgeon who
   treated Tsarnaev at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

   "This was a high-powered injury that has resulted in skull-base
   fracture, with injuries to the middle ear, the skull base, ... his ...
   vertebrae ... as well as injury to the pharynx, (and) the mouth." Odom
   said in testimony given April 22, three days after Tsarnaev was
   arrested following the bombing.

   Surgeon: Marathon as bad as Afghanistan

   His testimony, unsealed Monday, does not say whether the 20-year-old
   college student inflicted the wound on himself or suffered it during
   his showdown with police April 19.

   Authorities cornered him in a boat in the backyard of a Watertown,
   Massachusetts, home after an intense manhunt.

   Another document unsealed Monday said a special team of federal agents
   were able to speak with the seriously wounded Tsarnaev for about two
   days without any Miranda warnings being given, under a "public safety
   exception." The document shows he was read his Miranda rights in the
   hospital on April 22.

   Tsarnaev is charged with killing four people -- three spectators who
   died in the April 15 bombings and a Massachusetts Institute of
   Technology police officer ambushed in his cruiser a few days later.

   At least 264 people were wounded in the double bombings, which took
   place near the marathon finish line.

   [44]Controversial Rolling Stone cover of Tsarnaev called a 'slap' to
   Boston

   He is awaiting trial, after having pleaded not guilty to 30 federal
   charges. If convicted, he could receive up to life in prison or the
   death penalty.

   His older brother, [45]Tamerlan, is also accused of the attacks. He was
   killed when Tsarnaev ran over him as police were trying to handcuff
   him, authorities said.

   CNN learned in the weeks following the bombing that Tsarnaev admitted
   to the acts, and said he and his brother acted alone. Sources say he
   has since stopped talking with the government.
