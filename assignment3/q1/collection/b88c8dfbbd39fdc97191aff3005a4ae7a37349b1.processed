   President Barack Obama talks with Jack Lew on the Colonnade of the
   White House, after he announced Lew's nomination to replace Peter
   Orszag as director of the Office of Management and Budget, July 13,
   2010. At left, Bo, the Obama family dog, waits for the
   President Obama talks with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.
     * Treasury Secretary Jack Lew says Europeans should [29]seek to
       emulate the United States' economic policy of "balanced" austerity
       and growth:

     Two challenges we're going to make the case to the Europeans to deal
     with is one, is having European economies grow means they need to
     get the right balance between their budget policy right, so that
     they can get growth moving.
       No. Weak, tepid growth is not the key to broad prosperity or budget
       issues. All we got from it is a booming stock market for the
       wealthy and high unemployment for everyone else. Europeans don't
       need austerity-lite. Nor do we.
     * One Federal Reserve Bank president says despite the weak employment
       figures and little to inflation, what Fed needs to do is
       [30]tighten up:

     The Federal Reserve should tighten monetary policy, or the central
     bank risks damaging longer-term economic growth, the president of
     the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City said Friday, according to a
     Dow Jones report. "Continuing this current policy outside of a
     crisis, outside of a recession, poses risks for us in the long term
     to achieve our objectives of sustainable economic growth," George
     said, according to Dow Jones.
       Another one of our elites has it wrong. Despite everything the fed
       has done, every simple person predicting massive inflation has been
       dead wrong. Our problem is not loose money. Our problem is
       underutilized capacity and weak aggregate demand. (Sigh).
     * Need another example of just how misguided our economic
       policymakers are? [31]Okay:

     Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to Obama, said this week that
     the president was stepping up efforts to reach out to congressional
     Republicans to create conditions for a serious bipartisan agreement
     addressing the nation's fiscal situation, but warned the GOP needed
     to be willing to compromise.

     "But, you know, again it takes two to tango," he said at an
     appearance at the Pete Peterson Fiscal Summit.
       The fiscal situation is not the problem. The fiscal situation the
       symptom of the problem. The problem is weak economic growth and
       Republicans don't want any on Obama's watch.
     * Everyone says U.S. fiscal policy is [32]hurting the U.S. and the
       world. Because its true.
     * The continuation of the Reaganomics regime is causing [33]record
       high poverty.
     * Is there anything to celebrate in the current economic environment?
       If you are rich, [34]yes.
     * Progressives, Liberals, and Democrats have to keep fighting for our
       people, the poor and the middle class. Even despite the seemingly
       immovable opposition of Republicans and most of our own party's
       leadership class (who are broadly in agreement on economic policy).
       No matter how much the bad news gets us down, we have to keep
       fighting. Okay? Good.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [45]Tagging tips - [46]Search For Tags - [47]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Fourteen years ago this week, I picked some flowers to decorate my
       mother's grave and I headed out to All Saints Cemetery.
       I guess I had only been there in the limo, because as I felt my way
       along Rand Road and hit Central, it wasn't there.
       To my left at the red light was a Des Plaines police car, so I
       looked to the officer and asked, "Can you tell me which way I'd go
       to All Saints Cemetery?"
       "What is your mother's name?" he asked.
       I told him and he said, "Follow me."
       (My mother's name? What was that about?)
       The light turned green, then from the center lane he took a wide
       right in front of me onto Central eastbound, and I turned in right
       behind him. Within a mile I saw the cemetery fence coming up on the
       right, so I realized that I had wanted River Road, not Rand Road.
       (Sorry, Mom.)
       I figured he would wave for me to turn, but he drove right in. And
       I followed, through the labyrinth of circular byways that delineate
       such a huge cemetery. Then he stopped.
       He got out of his squad car and walked back to me and said, "She's
       right in here."
       (On the way he had radioed All Saints and gotten the exact
       location.)
       I told him, "Really, I'm not believing you could do this."
       He grinned a little, "You weren't the first one who asked. Happy
       Mothers Day."
       It was.
       Honesty is not a policy. It's a character trait.

     Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) made the comments on Saturday, after the
     Washington Post reported that Sebelius is asking industry groups and
     other community organizations to support efforts encouraging people
     to enroll in the new health care exchanges established under the
     health care law.

     Shortly after President George W. Bush's Medicare Part D reforms
     went into effect in January of 2006, Mark McClellan, administrator
     of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), told the
     House Ways and Means Committee that the Bush administration "began
     reaching out to develop partnerships" with industry and community
     groups since 2004, "held training sessions around the country to
     education our partners" and ran "print, radio and television
     advertisements" to "raise awareness and assist beneficiaries and
     their care givers in making decisions about prescription drugs."

     Following a stint as a Congressional legal counsel, she moved to
     Arkansas in 1974 and married Bill Clinton in 1975.
       [189]http://en.wikipedia.org/...

     In 1974 she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in
     Washington, D.C., advising the House Committee on the Judiciary
     during the Watergate scandal.[52] Under the guidance of Chief
     Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard Nussbaum,[35] Rodham
     helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds
     and standards for impeachment.[52] The committee's work culminated
     in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[52]

   Austerity be damned.

   We need jobs, we need a higher minimum wage, we need to spend in
   infrastructure, we need to spend in education.

   And I'll argue with anybody that if we cut our military spending to
   something reasonable and we implemented Single Payer healthcare (or at
   least a Public Option) we would have enough for all this and we
   wouldn't be arguing about SS and Medicare cuts.

   The DC bubble has trapped the Obama administration.

   I am getting very fed up.

   What went wrong there?
   [278]Bill Black:

     The point I was making was not who should be blamed for the insanity
     of the Sequester. The answer was always both political parties. I
     raised the President's efforts to save the Sequester because they
     revealed his real preferences. Those of us who teach economics
     explain to our students that what people say about their preferences
     is not as reliable as how they act. Their actions reveal their true
     preferences. President Obama has always known that the Sequester is
     terrible public policy. He has blasted it as a "manufactured
     crisis."

     the administration has stated publicly the three reasons this is so.
     First, the Sequester represents self-destructive austerity. Indeed,
     it would be the fourth act of self-destructive austerity. The August
     2011 budget deal already sharply limited spending and the January
     2013 "fiscal cliff" deal raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans
     and restored the full payroll tax. The cumulative effect of these
     three forms of austerity has already strangled the (modest) recovery
     - adding the Sequester, particularly given the Eurozone's
     austerity-induced recession, could tip us into a gratuitous
     recession.

     Second, the Sequester is a particularly stupid way to inflict
     austerity on a Nation. It is a bad combination of across the board
     cuts - but with many exemptions that lead to the cuts concentrating
     heavily in many vital programs that are already badly underfunded.

     Third, conservatives purport to believe in what Paul Krugman
     derisively calls the "confidence fairy." They assert that
     uncertainty explains our inadequate demand. The absurd,
     self-destructive austerity deals induced or threatened by the
     Sequester have caused recurrent crises and maximized uncertainty.
     They also show that the U.S. is not ready for prime time.

     When he acted to save the Sequester, Obama proved that he preferred
     the Sequester to the alternative. When the alternative threatened by
     the Republicans was causing a default on the U.S. debt (by refusing
     to increase the debt limit), one could understand Obama's preference
     (though even there I would have called the Republican bluff). The
     Republicans, however, had extended the debt limit in both of the
     cases that President Obama acted to save the Sequester in 2011.

     Similarly, President Obama has revealed his real preferences in the
     current blame game by not calling for a clean bill eliminating the
     Sequester. It is striking that as far as I know (1) neither Obama
     nor any administration official has called for the elimination of
     the Sequester and (2) we have a fairly silly blame game about how
     the Sequester was created without discussing the implications of
     Obama's continuing failure to call for the elimination of the
     Sequester despite his knowledge that it is highly self-destructive.

       [300]Not What They Say!

     Well, that's what they said ("meant to be"). But that's just
     kayfabe.

     What happened was that Obama delivered cuts for his owners. The cuts
     inflict great suffering on the poor, the old, children, and working
     people, which makes the elites happy, because their environment is
     morally pathological, as Jeffrey Sachs points out. Also, the elites
     think that taxes fund government spending, so they think that
     cutting the government will cut their taxes, and they hate taxes,
     because they believe that taxes, in part, go to help people they
     hate (like us). So, Obama delivers the goods for his owners, and
     best of all, he gets to blame the Republicans for it all, a task
     that his proxy, Hunter, performs for him superbly. Kayfabe once
     more.
     NOTE * Except for the parts that personally affect Congresscritters
     or their friends, like flying back to their constituents on
     airplanes.
       For many of us, the game is over.  We can clearly see what is going
       on.  Kayfabe!

   [463]New Rollout of Eligibility Engines!

     So, the White House ("we") reviewed the form. And having private
     consumer reporting agencies involved in determining your income
     (eligibility) for health insurance -- and hence, if you're lucky,
     health care and a coin flip in your favor for avoiding bankruptcy if
     you need serious help -- is, therefore, one of "these kinds of
     refinements" that the White House blessed.

     Bottom line: ObamaCare now integrates private "consumer reporting
     agencies [sic]" with public agencies in determining income
     (eligibility) for a Federal program. The term "consumer reporting
     agency" is at best a euphemism for "credit reporting company," even
     if "agency" does sound awfully official. In fact, in the house of
     consumer reporting are many mansions. Here's a list of the types of
     "consumer reporting agencies" from the Consumer Financial Protection
     Bureau:

     National Credit Reporting Companies
     Check Screening/Check History
     Payday Lending
     Auto and Property Insurance History Reports
     Supplementary/Alternative Credit Reports
     Utilities
     Rental
     Medical
     Employment History Reports
     I don't know about you, but the thought of using payday lender debt
     slave data** for ObamaCare income (eligibility) determination gives
     me the creeps. ("Whoa! She couldn't make the 339% interest rate
     payments! Thumbs down!"*) Oh, and "Supplementary/Alternative Credit
     Reports" looks exactly like the grab bag of bottom feeders you'd
     expect it to be.

     But let's give the administration the benefit of the doubt, assume
     that the rules are not yet written, and that "consumer reporting
     agencies" are limited to National Credit Reporting Agencies. Again,
     what could go wrong?

   You have to read the whole piece to grasp the total depravity of this.
    Penny Pritzker is certainly in the mix.  I hope someone with FP
   clearance takes this on.  Words escape me!

   We have passed a threshold for growth beyond the capacity of the planet
   to bear.
   We do need more movement and dynamism in the economy. The problem is
   that the money is not circulating being tied up in too few hands.
   The money is caught up in a false/contrived pseudo economy that moves
   papers of ownership among the 1%.

   Everything else needs to slow down and actually shrink not by austerity
   but by efficiency of stable cyclic systems. Cyclic systems would try to
   be as self-sustaining as possible as shipping is devoted to moving less
   processed materials.  The people at localities should be using value
   added labor.  The objective would be for communities to produce their
   own basic items from ever increasing localized economies. Re-institute

       on how to effect change difficult. The information gap has resulted
       in a knowledge lag that has hampered good decision-making for many.
       Spreading good information is the present challenge. That's because
       if we continue to have a society divided by schism issues like
       abortion, a topic that seems to drive reason out the window for
       many, achieving change is that much more difficult.
       And that was the intent of media focusing on schism issues. The
       overblown Benghazi situation is a current illustration of that
       tactic.

 ECONOMIC OBSERVATIONS ([585]0+ / 0-)


   FIRST OBSERVATION:  Money, wealth, capital, assets, etc. can be created
   and destroyed
   SECOND OBSERVATION:  Money, wealth, capital, assets, etc. are only
   useful when it is creating something useful to or for society, the
   nation or a culture.
   THIRD OBSERVATION:  As wealth is taken out of a society and made
   unavailable through gambling, speculation or other means social
   disorder increases.
   FORTH OBSERVATION:  Money, wealth, capital, assets, etc flows upward
   and if not stirred becomes stagnant.
   FIFTH OBSERVATION:  When consumption increases, employment increases,
   and visa- versa.
   SIXTH OBSERVATION:  No correlation exists between a low income rate for
   high income citizens and an increase performance in the national
   economy.
   SEVENTH OBSERVATION: The invisible hand has a thumb on the scale
   causing free enterprise and markets to favor the most powerful within
   any society.
   EIGHTH OBSERVATION: Only government can remove the thumb by using laws,
   rules and regulations and the strong, sure, even and fair enforcement
   thereof.
   NINTH OBSERVATION: Investment and consumption are not in competition
   but enjoy a symbiotic relationship.  Without investment there would be
   nothing to consume, and without consumption there would be no reason to
   invest.
   TENTH OBSERVATION: Full employment leads to fuller production and
   fuller services, and a more equal distribution of wealth, resources,
   capital and tax revenue.   It does not lead to inflation.
   ELEVENTH OBSERVATION: As the number of mega lending banks decreases,
   the competition between banks decreases resulting in the credit/bank-
   ratio-too-GDP increase.  When the credit/bank- ratio-too-GDP approaches
   100%, the economic growth of the nation decreases.
   TWELVETH OBSERVATION:   As unemployment increases the nation's deficit
   and debt increases.  As unemployment falls so does the deficit and
   debt, they are directly coupled!  WHY?   Workers pay income taxes.
   Taxes produce government revenue thereby reducing the deficit and debt.
   THIRDTEENTH OBSERVATION: Whenever corporations can profit by
   manipulation of information or cooperative collusion, its workers,
   customers and consumers are vulnerable to abuse, fraud and malfeasance.

   Hummingbirds are coming back here in the northeast.  Just a reminder to
   make your own nectar (4:1 water/plain white sugar), clean the feeders
   regularly in hot, soapy water and rinse thoroughly.

   They are wonderful for keeping insect populations in check, provide
   great bird watching opportunities, and augment pollination.

       5200' on the Pecos River Flyway.  Ever since the first hummer
       buzzed by checking us out.  I had that feeder out there in 10
       minutes.
       We put them out all around the place, so there is relief when one
       of the lil' fuckers decides  to establish dominance over a feeder.
        They are very feisty and contentious birds,  the caffeinated
       chihuahuas of the bird world.
       OTOH, under the right circumstance,  like everybody tanking up just
       before dark,  I've seen eight of them perched on a feeder with a
       couple more waiting their turn.
       We went through about 60 pounds of sugar last year.  Prolly use
       more this year,  as there is absolutely nothing growing out there
       other than where we irrigate, along the river.  3rd year of the
       worst drought anyone can remember.

 Loose money is a bigger problem than u think ([637]0+ / 0-)

   When looked from an inflationary perspective obviously it's not a
   problem.  When looked at from a retiree perspective it's a train wreck.
    Interest rates are way to low for retirees to generate any income and
   we all know social security is insufficient.  I think the Fed should
   tighten at this point.  The loose money is not stimulating banks in
   investing in America anyway.  I fear they are just using the money to
   pump up more misguided derivative schemes.
