   night owls
   At The Nation, Rick Perlstein gives us the skinny on [29]the March on
   Washington in Historical Context:

     Next week, as no one will be allowed to forget, marks the fiftieth
     anniversary of the August 28, 1963 March for Jobs and Freedom. In a
    country in which ignoring history is just about the national pastime,
     somehow this event--what it was like, and what it accomplished--is
   remembered indelibly. But here is what we have forgotten: how the event
    was thought about before it happened. In a way, the contrast between
      how the "March on Washington" was envisioned by most Americans on
      August 27, and how it was recalled on August 29, was its greatest
    accomplishment of all--the reason it became one of history's hinges.

   As I wrote in my book Before the Storm, "It was hard for white America
    to see anything benign in a mass gathering of Negroes. The fears were
      primal, subliminal. 'I don't like to touch them. It just makes me
   squeamish,' one Northerner told Newsweek. Another said, 'It's the idea
    of rubbing up against them. It won't rub off, but it don't feel right
   either.' The magazine's polling showed that 55 percent of whites would
     object to living next door to a black person--and 90 percent would
                   object if their daughter married one."

    Yesterday I did a deeper dive into what happened when a country that
   thought like that, pictured thousands of angry black people massing in
               Washington, D.C. The answer was: violent chaos.

   Rick Perlstein

    The first news stories about, as the [30]first Associated Press story
    put it, "Police intelligence reports that 100,000 Negroes might march
   on Capital Hill," came on June 23. Some context: that May had begun the
    escalating confrontation between the forces of Martin Luther King and
     the forces of Bull Connor in Birmingham, Alabama. By Memorial Day,
       civil rights protests spread to half a dozen cities, including
    Columbus, Ohio, where two men chained themselves to the furniture in
   the Capitol building. On June 11, registration day for new students at
     the University of Alabama, the state's new governor George Wallace
    "stood in the schoolhouse door" in Tuscaloosa to make sure no blacks
                              were among them.

      His supporters included the editorialists of the Winona (Kansas)
     Leader, who wrote, "The very people who have the greatest stake in
     preserving the Constitution"--black people--"are doing the most to
   destroy it" with their meddlesome protesting. The same night as George
      Wallace's stand, one of those meddlesome protesters, NAACP voter
   registration coordinator Medgar Evers, returned home from a day's work
     past midnight and was shot dead in his own driveway. That evening,
   President Kennedy had given a brave, bold speech announcing his support
           for a civil rights bill to outlaw segregation in public
   accommodations--"a moral issue...as old as the scriptures...as clear as
                         the American Constitution."

    On June 19, the President presented his legislation in a [31]special
     message to Congress. It included this admonition: "There have been
    increasing public demonstrations of resentment directed against this
    kind of discrimination--demonstrations which too often breed tension
   and violence. Only the federal government, it is clear, can make these
      demonstrations unnecessary by providing peaceful remedies for the
   grievances which set them off." He repeated the point at the end of the
     speech: "I want to caution against demonstrations which can lead to
                                 violence."

   I explained Kennedy's strange logic, which was all but universal among
    whites and even among plenty of timorous blacks, in Before the Storm:
      "In their conclusions the White House betrayed a constellation of
    unspoken assumptions about race relations--about social relations--in
     the United States: introduce bold legislation and the troublemakers
        would quit, like kidnappers who had been paid their ransom."
    But the troublemakers did not quit. And that freaked people the hell
                                 out. [...]
            _____________________________________________________

   [32]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2004--Dole a
   hypocrite:

    Josh Marshall applies the smackdown to Bob Dole, so I don't have to:
   Today Bob Dole suggested that one or more of John Kerry's Purple Hearts
   may have been fraudulent in some way because they were for "superficial
                                  wounds."

                             Dole knows better.
    In a 1988 campaign-trail autobiography, here's how Dole described the
   incident that earned him his first Purple Heart: "As we approached the
   enemy, there was a brief exchange of gunfire. I took a grenade in hand,
     pulled the pin, and tossed it in the direction of the farmhouse. It
   wasn't a very good pitch (remember, I was used to catching passes, not
    throwing them). In the darkness, the grenade must have struck a tree
   and bounced off. It exploded nearby, sending a sliver of metal into my
    leg--the sort of injury the Army patched up with Mercurochrome and a
                               Purple Heart."

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [52]Tagging tips - [53]Search For Tags - [54]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     Yesterday around 10:30 a.m., Bree Fuqua strolled into British
     Columbia's Manning Park, the northern terminus of the Pacific Crest
     Trail. A clump of historic monuments greeted her, including one that
     reminded how far she had traveled: more than 2,600 miles...

     It's official. Bree has completed the entire PCT, hiking a total of
     2,668 miles from the Mexican border to the southern mountains of
     B.C. She completed the rare feat in 110 days without taking a single
     day off since starting in early May. She became the second fastest
     female finisher on the PCT this year, according to the register at
     the border.

     ...   The 31-year-old special education and math teacher at Glacier
     High School hit the trail in early May and the Beacon has followed
     her journey north.

   The article includes links to previous reports and her website.

   if you're supposed to get about 120 credits(Semester hours) to earn a
   Undergrad degree that means a about 15 Credits (Semester hours) per
   semester. With part time employment to help fill in the gaps in funding
   making good grades and 15 Credits load seemingly impossible.

   What's the plan here drop the number of credits for a undergrad or make
   the Semester hour load beyond impossible for those who have to work?

       throughput worse and cohort planning worse as well as creating an
       culture more flexible for students to drop courses, further
       delaying the graduation clock. a student who drops to below 12
       credits may jeopardize student loans among other things.
       And of course, crappier places may have higher retention rates
       requiring further adjustments in institutional resources and course

       I don't know what other schools may do it, but University of
       Chicago processes admissions blind, and then takes the
       responsibility for finding funding for students they accept. This
       may include work-study, but more is generally from other sources,
       and I think there are more grants than loans.

       I attended a State College in NJ back in the late seventies.
       I went part time and full time. Dropped out for a few years, went
       back in 83' and graduated in 90'. It took me 8 years to graduate.
       I worked at the college "work study job" for seven years. Minimum
       wage but very flexible hours.
       I never had any scholarships. But the thing with the Federal
       Financial Aid is
       Whether one attends full time or part time affects the yearly
       amount of Financial Aid that one receives.
       You have to attend at least half-time to be eligible for financial
       aid and work study.
       But other than that part time, you just get less funding each year.
       But it adds up to the same amount as full time in the end.

   semester there is 45 contact hours in a 15-week semester of which 2-3
   times those hours is dedicated to work outside of class during the
   term. Doesn't seem to leave much time for part-time work or
   extra-curricular activity, but working while in college, while
   necessary should not trump the college experience. OTOH, students
   taking 5 courses a term seems a bit heavy and of course many colleges
   have a ceiling at 18+ units. Consequently, the average number years to
   graduate is rarely close to the planned four years. It is more like
   five years.

   A solution would be making more college courses 4 semester units
   allowing for a normal load of 4 courses per term and 128 hours to
   graduate. Course inflation has paralleled grade inflation as well as
   the dual-tier labor market where faculty loads are inequitable for
   seniority or status.

   Finally, there are other solutions: summer school and online can help
   with achieving graduation 4 years from matriculation

       ... since the early 1970s is, in some respects, criminal as wealth
       and income inequality has increased dramatically.  All you have to
       look at is the differential in CEO vs average worker compensation
       today as opposed to four or five decades ago.
       The reasons are many.  Unlike the period 1945-1973 when, to
       paraphrase Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar," it bestrode the world
       like an economic colossus resulting in shared domestic prosperity,
       the United States is no longer a self-contained economy immune from
       foreign economic competition. The rise of Germany, Japan, and the
       Asian Tigers; deregulation resulting in outsourcing of jobs;
       technological improvements increasing efficiency; corporate
       influence over lawmakers becoming more pervasive; less-than-honest
       international trade agreements; and a host of other factors have
       contributed to stagnant wages, decline in living standards for the
       middle class, and as you point out above, reduced purchasing power.
       The sad aspect of all of this is very few elected officials talk
       about the poor. Where are the leaders like LBJ, MLK, and RFK who
       spoke about the concerns of the poor and downtrodden?  Today, is
       the middle class even being taken care of?  It seems to me that a
       lot is this is due to the pernicious effect of large sums of money
       in politics.  Campaign donations buy influence, corporations and
       the wealthy benefit, and the rest get royally screwed.
       No wonder some people ask the question, "Is the American Dream
       still alive?"
       ps: thanks for your generous remarks, Jim.

       Because it's driven the hardcore racists nuts, and brought the
       simmering racism in otherwise quiet bigots to a full boil. What
       used to be secretly said behind closed doors has been brought right
       out into the open - nudged along by right wing propaganda machines
       and politicians who've blatantly painted the President as 'the
       other', 'dangerous', 'hates America', 'hates whites', and is 'an
       angry black'. And Pat Robertson has been one of those responsible
       for fanning the flames.

   [595]Vaccine-fearing Texas megachurch urges flock to immunize after
   measles outbreak

     A Texas megachurch whose leaders have linked vaccines to autism is
     now asking its members to get immunizations or stay quarantined
     after an outbreak of measles was traced to the congregation.

     Instead of her normal sermon on Sunday, Eagle Mountain International
     Church Pastor Terri Copeland Pearsons was forced to [596]spend the
     majority of her time explaining how the congregation should react to
     the news that [597]all of the 11 measles cases in Tarrant County had
     been linked to members or visitors of the church.

     ....

     Pearsons went on to say that the church was offering free
     vaccination clinics, and urged those who did not attend to
     quarantine themselves at home for two weeks.

     But the call for vaccinations was made awkward by the fact that
     Pearsons' father, televangelist Kenneth Copeland, has [598]promoted
     the idea that vaccines may lead to autism, [599]according to the
     Dallas Observer.

     ....

     Pearsons did her best on Sunday to try to put a biblical spin on why
     the church had flip-flopped on its vaccination stance.

     "There are a lot of people that think the Bible -- we talk about
     walking by faith -- it leaves out things such as, I don't know,
     people just get strange," she said. "But when you read the Old
     Testament, you find that it is full of precautionary measures, and
     it is full of the law."

     ....

     In a [600]statement on the church website, Pearsons also insisted
     that she did not share her fathers fear of autism.

     "Some people think I am against immunizations, but that is not
     true," the statement said. "Vaccinations help cut the mortality rate
     enormously. I believe it is wrong to be against vaccinations. The
     concerns we have had are primarily with very young children who have
     family history of autism and with bundling too many immunizations at
     one time. There is no indication of the autism connection with
     vaccinations in older children. Furthermore, the new MMR vaccination
     is without thimerosal (mercury), which has also been a concern to
     many."

 Bravo to Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear (D). ([644]23+ / 0-)

   He may be a conservadem, but yesterday, man, the [668]fireworks flew in
   Louisville.  Per the [669]National Journal:

     LOUISVILLE, Ky.--The excitement at the Kentucky Farm Bureau Country
     Ham Breakfast is usually over how high the bids will go when a ham
     is auctioned. But this year, it came when Democratic Gov. Steve
     Beshear made an emotional case for the Affordable Care Act as a
     chance to change his state's long history of poor health.

     It was not what anyone expected--least of all Republican Sens. Mitch
     McConnell and Rand Paul, who sat stone-faced onstage with Beshear as
     he unloaded on them without using names.

     ....

     Beshear was the homespun populist, appealing to people's instincts
     to want the best for their friends, relatives, and neighbors. ...

     Beshear's advocacy, by contrast, was striking in its intensity and
     in how personally he approached the issue, picking up on the idea
     that many people who don't have health insurance are embarrassed by
     that and don't talk about it.

     The governor compared health insurance to "the safety net of crop
     insurance" and said farmers need both. He said 640,000
     Kentuckians--15 percent of the state--don't have health insurance
     and "trust me, you know many of those 640,000 people. You're friends
     with them. You're probably related to them. Some may be your sons
     and daughters. You go to church with them. Shop with them. Help them
     harvest their fields. Sit in the stands with them as you watch your
     kids play football or basketball or ride a horse in competition.
     Heck, you may even be one of them."

     Beshear went on to say that "it's no fun" hoping and praying you
     don't get sick, or choosing whether to pay for food or medicine. He
     also said Kentucky is at or near the top of the charts on bad-health
     indicators, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer deaths, and
     preventable hospitalizations. He said all that affects everything
     from productivity and school attendance to health costs and the
     state's image.

     "We've ranked that bad for a long, long time," he said. "The
     Affordable Care Act is our historic opportunity to address this
     weakness and to change the course of the future of the commonwealth.
     We're going to make insurance available for the very first time in
     our history to every single citizen of the commonwealth of
     Kentucky."

     About half the audience burst into applause at that point while the
     other half sat on their hands. But he wasn't done. He cited a study
     that showed the law would inject about $15.6 billion into the
     Kentucky economy over eight years, create 17,000 new jobs, and
     generate $802 million for the state budget.

     "It's amazing to me how people who are pouring time and money and
     energy into trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act sure haven't
     put that kind of energy into trying to improve the health of
     Kentuckians. And think of the decades that they have had to make
     some kind of difference," Beshear finished pointedly.

   And then Rand Paul whined afterwards about how Beshear made it all
   partisan and political.  Waaaaaah.

     Paul, who wants to try to defund the law as a way to buy leverage to
     delay it and ultimately kill it, picked up on Beshear's point about
     the economic benefits. "It's going to bring $15 billion to our
     state. From where?" he asked, his voice rising. "From the Federal
     Reserve, which is already sitting at minus $17 trillion. It's not
     free. There are consequences to this."

     Later, Paul told National Journal Daily that he was surprised by
     Beshear's speech. "The farm breakfast is usually a little less
     partisan, and I had not planned to say anything about Obamacare," he
     said. "This is more about farmers and issues directed toward
     farmers. I typically don't talk about more partisan issues before a
     less partisan crowd. I usually take the opportunity to talk about
     things that people tend to agree more on--two or three issues where
     I work with Democrats." On Thursday, those issues included civil
     liberties and pulling back aid to Egypt.

   Yes, let's not talk about anything partisan.  Let's talk about Egypt
   and civil liberties.  Nothing possibly partisan about those things, eh?

   couldn't stop the march, he tried to take it over, and it did change in
   some ways.

   Therefore it's important to remember that MLK was more than just a
   dreamer; in his speech he spoke of not being satisfied (interesting in
   sight of Kennedy's announcement) until racial justice is achieved, and
   clearly stated the case for using non-violent direct action to make
   change. In other words, stop blaming us for getting beaten up; put the
   blame where it belongs.

   be Republican, but then quit the party and renounced basically the
   entire party platform, after the scales fell from their eyes.  That's
   why I like Balloon Juice, Little Green Footballs, and yes, DailyKos
   (remember, Markos was a Republican growing up).  So LGF had a
   [767]piece up asking us not to hyperventilate over the NSA report about
   abuses.

     I don't even know what to say about this insanely overblown hysteria
     any more: [768]NSA Analysts Intentionally Abused Spying Powers
     Multiple Times.

     MULTIPLE TIMES! (Run around screaming.) MULTIPLE TIMES! THIS IS BAD,
     PEOPLE!

     Oh wait. You mean, "multiple times" is actually ... ten times, in
     ten years? And they were reported, corrected, and action was taken
     against the violators?

     Good freaking grief.

   Not that this story is a nothingburger, but there were some pretty wild
   comments here over the story.  I saw one rec listed diarist say we need
   to "shut down the NSA" over another story from today.  Um, so you don't
   want any government agency monitoring even any foreign communications
   among suspected and known terrorists??  Oy.

   Johnson then pointed out [769]another article where the headline was
   purposefully misleading.  He then [770]pointed to another guy that's
   been in the news recently, Rand Paul's "Southern Avenger".

     But the article, rather casually, revealed that Glenn Greenwald had
     been a speaker on something fatuously named The Young American
     Liberty Tour "with three civil liberties experts," titled "The War
     on Terrorism, Civil Liberties, and the Constitution'."

     ....

     The real 5-alarm bell-ringer, though, was the moderator, Jack
     Hunter, the goddamn luchador of the losers, the Southern Avenger.

     The topics covered were:

     Habeas corpus, the PATRIOT Act, extraordinary rendition, torture,
     regime change, and a general discussion about how the war on
     terrorism has infringed upon the rights of U.S. citizens in the name
     of making us safe.

     I do not think the agenda was big on voting rights,
     anti-discrimination (since I know that Hornberger supports the right
     of businesses to discriminate) or other civil liberties for black
     people.

     I do not understand how any man with any shred of integrity as a
     `civil rights' speaker can share the stage with someone named the
     Southern Avenger. Even the Southern Defender, I could slightly
     imagine. But vengeance implies someone who thinks a wrong has been
     done to the South, that there is some reckoning against the enemies
     of the South that has to come. And that is the really fucking scary
     kind of racism.

     If people do think the NSA story is super-important, they should be
     hoping beyond hope that Glenn Greenwald gets distracted by something
     else. He is a horrible journalist and a worse advocate.

   I've long said that Rand Paul's version of civil liberties is... civil
   liberties for straight white males.  Fuck you if you're gay, female, or
   a minority.  While guilt by association can be a dangerous thing to
   accuse someone of, when someone repeatedly cozies up to racists who
   only care about civil liberties for people like themselves, they're not
   going to come off looking very good themselves.  Lie down with dogs
   often enough, and you'll wake up with fleas.

   Hopefully the story about the NYT getting the Snowden docs as well
   means we'll be getting some good reporting from them, without the
   hyperbole that only serves to inflame.

   From Rick Perlstein's article:

     Their was another fear driving polite opinion: the tides of
     right-wing reaction.
      That same Independence Day conservatives thronged a massive Barry
     Goldwater rally at the DC armory despite the sweltering heat; around
     that time, a congressman told columnist Stewart Alsop, "A few race
     riots in the North and Barry might make it." (And wouldn't that all
     be your fault, Martin Luther King?)  - emphasis added

   ..[808]without a word changed, except today it's not nearly as polite

   So fears of racial tension/riots would be blamed on AA's and might help
   the republicans 50 years ago. It seems that for some that idea hasn't
   changed much

        Recommended by:
                [896]Eric Nelson

       even in NASCAR as with gen 5 and 6 cars which occured both for
       regulatory reasons as well as to allow for primary engine and
       fascia differentiation. America's Cup did have differentiation but
       Dennis Connor made a mockery of it with the catamaran vs. monohull
       iteration in 1987:

     In 1987, soon after Conner had won back the Cup with Stars and
     Stripes but before the San Diego Yacht Club had publicly issued
     terms for the next regatta, a New Zealand syndicate, again led by
     merchant banker Sir Michael Fay, lodged a surprise Deed-of-Gift
     challenge. Fay challenged with a gigantic yacht named New Zealand
     (KZ1) or the Big Boat, which with a 90-foot (27 m) waterline, was
     the largest single-masted yacht possible under the original rules of
     the cup trust deed. This was an unwelcome challenge to the San Diego
     Yacht Club, who wanted to continue to run Cup regattas using
     12-metre yachts. A legal battle ensued over the challenge, with
     Justice Carmen Ciparick of the New York State Supreme (trial) Court
     (which administers the Deed of Gift) ruling that Fay's challenge on
     behalf of Mercury Bay Boating Club (MBBC) was valid. The court
     ordered SDYC to accept it and negotiate mutually agreeable terms for
     a match, or to race under the default provisions of the Deed, or to
     forfeit the Cup to MBBC.

     Forced to race, and lacking time for preparation, Conner and SDYC
     looked for a way to prevail. They recognized that a catamaran was
     not expressly prohibited under the rules. Multihulls, due to a lower
     wetted surface area and vastly lower mass, are inherently faster
     than equal-length monohulls. Conner, however, left nothing to chance
     and commissioned a cutting-edge design with a wing sail, named--as
     his 12-metre yachts had been--Stars and Stripes.
     The two yachts raced under the simple terms of the Deed in
     September, 1988. New Zealand predictably lost by a huge margin. Fay
     then took SDYC back to court, arguing that the race had been unfair,
     certainly not the "friendly competition between nations", envisaged
     in the Deed of Gift. Ciparick agreed and awarded New Zealand the
     Cup. However, Ciparick's decision was overturned on appeal and
     SDYC's win was reinstated. Fay then appealed to New York's highest
     court and lost. Thus SDYC successfully defended the Cup in what
     observers described as the most controversial Cup match to that
     point. (The 2010 America's Cup was a direct descendant of the 1988
     Cup, as it featured two gigantic multi-hull yachts and generated
     even more legal activity and controversy.)

   ..they aren't as constained by hull length as dispacement boats are
   which determines the speed a boat can go.

   Plus when they lift one hull out of the water thay have only to
   displace half as much water.

   A displacement boat means that wherever the boat moves the hull has to
   displace tha amount of water that the size and weight of water that the
   boat displaces.

   for the America's cup.  The reason there are only four countries
   competing is because the cats they designed brought the price up to 100

   Another thing about these boats.  They're built on the piers here in
   San Francisco - molded, pieced together, and raced four times before
   they're discarded and a new boat is built to replace them.  They're
   that fragile.  But that makes them fast, too...speeds of up to 34 knots
   have been recorded...

       I have always been a lover of sailing. When I was a kid we had a
       small 27 foot sailboat and my dad would take us sailing out of
       Channel Islands harbor here in So. Cal and we had friends who had a
       larger sailboat we took out of Ventura Harbor. There is something
       special about sailing, moving swiftly through the water under the
       power of the winds.
       When I was younger and lived in the Washington, D.C. area
       (Northern, Va.) I made friends with some people whose boss owned a
       46 foot beauty that we sailed on the Chesapeake Bay; so many great
       summer days. When I moved back to California, I had a friend who
       had a beautiful 43 foot Hans Christian with beautiful teak decks
       that we sailed out of Long Beach, Ca., often over to Catalina
       Island, now that was a lot of fun; plenty of eating, drinking, and
       making merry ;D It has been a few years since I last sailed and I
       miss it...

   If it is a commercial FOR ice cream or milk then it is the real thing.
   If milk or ice cream are just a prop (commercial for cereal with milk
   in the bowl) then they are most likely fake. Also the ice cream is
   usually not mashed potatoes, but colored Crisco.

   years old at the time, but I do remember the grown-ups being, ummm,
   unsupportive of the march. Afraid.
   We lived in Fairfax county, just a few miles down the Shirley highway
   from the capital mall.  I don't remember the word "march" being used
   nearly so much as "riot".

 "Ironies push resistance forward" by Kevin Zeese ([1022]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1023]Chi

     One of the strange ironies of the upcoming week is the events around
     the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington where Rev. Dr.
     Martin Luther King, Jr. gave the "I Have a Dream" speech. The event
     has been turned into a Democratic Party pep rally with people like
     Representatives Steny Hoyer and Nancy Pelosi invited to speak. The
     irony is, as Cornell West says, "Brother Martin would not be invited
     to the very march in his name, because he would talk about drones.
     He'd talk about Wall Street criminality. He would talk about working
     class being pushed to the margins as profits went up for corporate
     executives in their compensation."
