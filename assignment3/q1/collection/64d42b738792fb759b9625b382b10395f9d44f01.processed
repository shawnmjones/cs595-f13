   Michigan voters voiced a resounding "hands off my constitution" on
   Tuesday, overwhelmingly rejecting all five attempts to amend the state
   constitution.

   [165]Proposal 1 to [166]repeal the states toughened emergency manager
   law, also ended in a no vote, 52% to 48%, with 93% of precincts
   reporting. But that outcome means the law, Public Act 4 of 2011, has
   been repealed.

   o For vote totals, other results: [167]Ballot proposals, [168]Macomb
   County, [169]Oakland County, [170]Wayne County

   The failed attempts to amend the constitution are a major blow to
   organized labor and a sharp rebuke to Ambassador Bridge owner Manuel
   (Matty) Moroun, who spent more than $33 million in an effort to require
   a statewide vote on a new public bridge to Canada championed by Gov.
   Rick Snyder and supported by most of the state's business and labor
   leaders.

   "It's very good news," said Rich Studley, president and CEO of the
   Michigan Chamber of Commerce. "I think the voters have sent a clear and
   strong message to the unions and to narrow special interests that
   Michigan's constitution is not for sale."

   Dan Lijana, a spokesman for the [171]Proposal 2 committee, Protect
   Working Families, had no immediate comment.

   Spending for and against the proposals generated a record $150 million
   and what seemed like nonstop TV advertising for weeks before Tuesday's
   vote.

   Labor still claimed a victory through the repeal of the controversial
   emergency manager law.

   The most controversial aspect of the law allowed state-appointed
   emergency managers overseeing cities or school districts to amend or
   scrap collective bargaining agreements.

   Stand Up for Democracy, the group fighting to repeal the law, is backed
   by the large public employee union, the American Federation of State,
   County and Municipal Employees.

   The repeal of Public Act 4 reignites a controversy over whether the
   former emergency financial manager law, Public Act 72 of 1990, is now
   in effect.

   The win on Proposal 1 gave little comfort to state union leaders who
   lost what was almost an all-in gamble on Proposal 2.

   Proposal 2 was labor's response to what they saw as a steady stream of
   anti-union legislation from Lansing and the worry that right-to-work
   legislation, to outlaw closed union shops, would follow.

   With that proposal defeated, it's not clear whether the
   Republican-controlled state Legislature will view the result as a green
   light to proceed with right to work, which would make it illegal to
   require financial support of a union as a condition of employment.
   Snyder had told Republican lawmakers he had no interest in changing
   Michigan's right-to-work status, but also urged union leaders to back
   off Proposal 2 before it gained a spot on the ballot.

   The UAW, teacher unions, and other unions contributed more than $23
   million to the Proposal 2 campaign.

   But the unprecedented union initiative was met with equal or greater
   force and money from pro-business groups, which put about $31 million
   into two committees aimed at fighting Proposal 2 and other initiatives.

   The third labor-backed initiative was [172]Proposal 4, dealing with
   home health care and was backed by the Service Employees International
   Union.

   It would create a Michigan Quality Home Care Council and require
   background screening and a registry for home health care workers. But
   it also would continue what has been described as a "dues skim" by
   which the SEIU collects about $6 million a year from the pay of home
   health care workers, many of whom are caring for family members.

   On [173]the bridge question, Moroun's proposal was defeated soundly
   despite a spending mismatch and an onslaught of misleading TV ads.

   Auto companies and others who support the New International Trade
   Crossing put together only about $1.6 million in opposition, much of
   which was used for an ad that recently aired featuring an animated
   image of Moroun strumming a guitar and singing about his bridge
   monopoly.

   [174]Proposal 3, which would amend the Michigan Constitution to require
   25% of the state's energy to come from renewable sources by the year
   2025, also was defeated after an intense advertising campaign in
   opposition largely funded by the state's big utilities.

   [175]Proposal 5, to require a two-thirds legislative supermajority to
   approve new tax increases, also was defeated. Critics said it was too
   inflexible and could even hamper reform initiatives to reduce taxes.
