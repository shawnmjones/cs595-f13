   Democrats are pounding McConnell with a new ad even as he gains a tea
   party challenge
   It was pretty obvious [30]yesterday that Kentucky businessman Matt
   Bevin would launch a tea party-backed primary challenge of Senate
   Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, but today his political team [31]made
   it official:

     A tea party activist who has signaled that he intends to begin a
     campaign to take on Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell in next
     year's GOP primary in Kentucky has now removed all doubt.

     An aide to Louisville businessman Matt Bevin distributed a press
     advisory on Tuesday announcing stops on a statewide tour "announcing
     his candidacy" for Senate.

   Kentucky's junior senator Rand Paul reiterated his endorsement of
   McConnell, but also said he would not discourage Bevin from running.
   Meanwhile, a coalition of Kentucky tea party groups [32]urged national
   tea party organizations to drop their support for McConnell:

     "Senator McConnell's Progressive Liberal voting record, his absolute
     iron fisted rule over the Republican Party in Kentucky and his
     willingness to roll over and cede power to President Obama and the
     Liberals in Washington, prove that he is no friend to the American
     people or the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky," the letter
     says.

     "Your endorsement undermines the work of the real grassroots Tea
     Party organizations all over Kentucky," the letter continues.  "Had
     you taken the time to reach out to us, you would have learned that
     the Tea Parties in Kentucky do NOT support Senator McConnell's
     campaign."

   Progressive liberal? Oh my. These guys are so off the deep end that I'm
   beginning to think they may actually have a shot of winning this
   primary for Bevin.

   McConnell's campaign is already attacking Bevin, calling him an "East
   coast con man" for accepting a $100,000 grant from Connecticut to
   rebuild his family's bell manufacturing business after it burned to the
   ground following a lightning strike. Bevin-land [33]fired back in
   response:

     "Mitch McConnell is bringing up the loan Matt received to help
     rebuild his factory because McConnell doesn't want to talk about all
     the bailouts in his voting record," said Bevin spokeswoman Sarah
     Durand, "such as the Wall Street bailout and the bailout of Fannie
     Mae and Freddie Mac."

     "If Mitch McConnell had ever run a business or worked in the private
     sector, he would recognize what a commendable thing Matt did: He
     took a nearly bankrupt company, turned it around, saved American
     jobs and kept a historic bell manufacturing company in America,"
     Durand, the Louisville Tea Party President continued.  "Sadly, Mitch
     McConnell is so out of touch, he doesn't even understand that saving
     American jobs is a good thing."

   So not only do we get the pleasure of munching popcorn during a GOP
   primary that will obviously be deliciously bitter, we also get to enjoy
   the spectacle of a businessman defending the use of public funds to
   create jobs while simultaneously attacking Mitch McConnell as a
   liberal. And with Kentucky's primary not taking place until May 2014,
   we've got nearly 10 more months of this to look forward to. Fun times.

   [34]10:25 AM PT: And some more fun:

   the lies that come with his character assassinations, Mitch McConnell
   cannot win an election"

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [50]Tagging tips - [51]Search For Tags - [52]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Attacks reduce credibility ([562]0+ / 0-)
       McConnell doesn't have much credibility here, but he has some in

        He has faced many potential opponents and he has responded to all
       threats with a high powered attack.  There was never some sort of
       "The Senator looks forward to an engaging debate".  It was always,
       "The Senator's opponent kills puppies".
       By the time the general election rolls around in 2014, he might be

   It's fun to watch them tear each other to pieces, but does it provide

   If Bevins wins, we lose.  If McConnell wins, we lose. I suppose Bevins
   will help with the natural destruction of the Republican Party, but the
   truth is, these idiots get elected in states like Kentucky.

   Now, if McConnell survives but bloodied and weakened, with the Tea
   Party disillusioned, do we have a shot?  If Bevins wins, and he's a
   nutcase 'bagger, is there a chance that there are enough sane people in
   KY for an upset for our candidate?  Who is our candidate, anyway?

   arcs on a ever increasing tangent from reality.

       But the problem is, they are never challenged.  The GOP candidates
       placate them because they are afraid of challenge from them.  Which
       comes anyway.  Meanwhile, the Dems move further and further to the
       right in order to keep up with the rhetoric.  And the media loves
       them because they are propping the whole 'spontaneous citizen
       activism' bullshit angle.

   I love watching the GOP tear each other apart as much as the next
   person, but.......

   Kentucky may be so far gone down the GOP rat hole that they may
   automatically vote for anyone with an "R" after their name on the
   ballot.

   McConnell sucks in a big way - but things are never so screwed up that
   someone can't make them worse.

       The same situation exists in West Virginia and Oklahoma. There are
       lots and lots of white Dixiecrats who haven't voted for a Democrat
       for federal office since the Reagan administration. It explains

 Hey -- I won't fault ([722]0+ / 0-)

   Bevin from getting a grant for the Bevin Bell Factory in East Hampton,
   Connnecticut (Bell Town).  It is an over 180 year old company and the
   last bell factory in the country.  Too bad a Teabagger is involved, but
   the fire that destroyed that factory was devastating.

   Of course, if Mitch really wanted to sock it to Bevin, he could mention
   that progressive Sen. Dick Blumenthal backed the grant.
