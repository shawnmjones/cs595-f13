The Lever Voting Machines Are Blowing It

   If the old, Soviet-era lever voting machines had one virtue, it was
   their supposed reliability. But according to multiple reports this
   morning, the things are just crapping out left and right.

   One frustrated voter wrote us to tell of confusion at her polling place
   in Crown Heights. After some initial back-and-forth with poll workers
   regarding her proper voting location, our tipster finally made it into
   the booth. But then:

     The lever for two Public Advocate candidates (Reshma Saujani and
     Sidique Wai) were broken on the machine. Now everyone is getting in
     the booth with me. All the old women poll workers are convinced that
     I am pressing the wrong lever. The police monitors get in there, try
     to put some man power behind it. No one knows what to do or what is
     going on.

   Ultimately, she had to complete an "emergency ballot," which was
   deposited into a cardboard ballot box. Moreover, our tipster reports
   she saw "several other voters" enter the booth with the broken machine.

   What else? Councilman Brad Lander issued a desperate plea earlier this
   morning about broken voting machines at the Park Slope Armory:

     Please help! [18]@BOENYC Many machines broken at Park Slope Armory
     (44th AD in Brooklyn). Many voters turned away.
     -- Brad Lander (@bradlander) [19]September 10, 2013

   And in northeast Queens, apparently all the machines were down
   throughout an entire district!

     .[20]@BOENYC reports that all voting machines are down at PS 31 in
     my district (213-45 46 Rd bayside hills) [21]#NYC2013 [22]#Queens
     [23]@katie_honan
     -- Nily Rozic (@nily) [24]September 10, 2013

   Meanwhile, the Board of Elections' [25]Twitter feed is a panoply of
   apologies, with several tweets in a row containing statements like
   "They must be misinformed," "The blind/disabled cannot be turned down,"
   and my favorite, "That's understandable and we are very sorry you
   didn't get to have that experience." A BOE spokesperson did not
   immediately respond to a request for comment.

   Perhaps the most telling indicator of the day's issues is that even
   Republican candidate Joe Lhota was denied the lever's satisfying
   "clink":

     All lever voting machines were broken, except for one, at poll site
     in Brooklyn where [26]#Lhota voted.He had to vote via paper ballot.
