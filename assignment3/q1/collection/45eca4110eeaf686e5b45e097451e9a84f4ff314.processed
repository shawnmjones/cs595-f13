   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   Yay! Maine's Crazy Uncles are Back!!!

   Backstory: Last month, Maine tea party Republican Governor Paul
   LePage---one of many unqualified goobers swept into office nationwide
   in 2010---[29]said this about a Democratic state senator:

     "Senator Jackson claims to be for the people, but he's the first one
     to give it to the people without providing Vaseline."

   His comment drew universal condemnation from Democrats, Republicans,
   Libertarians, North Korea, several star systems including
   Arglebargle-7...hell, I hear even Louie Gohmert was like, "Whoa." Only
   one group welcomed Governor LePage's Vaseline comment: the makers of
   Vaseline. (Hey, publicity is publicity.) But one thing was for sure:
   Governor LePage wanted the whole thing to go away---fast.
   Vintage Vaseline ad
   "...like shut those two idiots up!"
   -
   Enter Maine's own conservative Christian Tweedledum and
   Tweedledee---minus the intellectual heft but double the bumbling---to
   pull out their bullhorns inside the State House just 48 hours ago and
   [30]give the governor's anal-sex slur "Two Thumbs Up the Tuckus!"

     "He's a man and he's one that we should respect," said [Maine
     Grassroots Coalition head Paul] Madore. "It was wrong for Christian
     leaders to criticize him the way that they did." [...]

     "He was angry and he spoke out very emotionally and like a man and I
     loved it," said [former Christian Civic League Director Michael]
     Heath. "It felt like thunder and lightning to me. It's so refreshing
     in this age of insanity when it comes to sexuality to hear someone
     in public life use sodomy, gay, homosexual---pick your word---in the
     proper context. It's negative. ... What's good is sexuality in
     marriage and what is linked to having children and grandchildren.
     Civilization has survived because we reward that behavior and
     discourage the other behavior."

     Asked by a reporter to respond to the fact that LePage apologized
     for the Vaseline comment the day after he made it, Heath said
     "that's between him and God."

   LePage is Catholic, and I'd pay a million dollars to be the priest who
   hears that confession. (Although I understand that if he starts
   following the Pope on Twitter he'll [31]catch a break on his time in
   Purgatory.)

   As for the response from the hapless governor to Tweedledum and
   Tweedledee's 40 minute flame-fanning fest that revived Slipperygoogate,
   I believe it can be summed up thusly: "Shut up, shut up, shut up!"

   Fat chance. If it's one thing those two holy rollers keep lubed at all
   times, it's their jawbones.

   CHEERS to new teammates.  We got a new Labor Secretary!!!  We got a new
   EPA Administrator!!!  I don't know what kind of dirt Harry Reid found
   on Mitch McConnell, but apparently it was enough to break the
   filibuster logjam.  The new Labor guy is [34]Thomas Perez, who made
   Rush Limbaugh so scared that the EIB sponsor-hemorrhager panic-compared
   him to the "grand kleagle of the Ku Klux Klan."  The new EPA chief is
   [35]Gina McCarthy, whom Republicans despise because, in her previous
   job as chief air-quality regulator, she hurt Big Energy's fee-fees.  So
   far I'd say they're both off to a great start.

   JEERS to the American Taliban.  Speaking to his American constituents,
   Utah State Senator Aaron Osmond [36]says compulsory education is
   tyranny and should be stopped.  Speaking to her Taliban would-be
   assassins and other backward-looking dodo heads who think compulsory
   education is tyranny and should be stopped, 16 year-old Malala
   Yousafzai [37]says, "We call upon all governments to ensure free,
   compulsory education all over the world for every child."  Oh to be a
   fly on the wall when the two of them end up sharing an elevator.
   George McGovern looking at newspaper with Heckuva job, America.
   -
   CHEERS to South Dakota's late, great moral compass.  World War II hero,
   former Senator and Democratic presidential contender [38]George
   McGovern died last October, dammit.  Today we remember him on what
   would've been his 91st birthday.  If he'd been elected in '72, the
   Vietnam War would've ended sooner, progressive values would've sunk
   their roots deeper into the American consciousness, and the integrity
   of the office of the President would've held fast.  Instead we
   re-elected a corrupt, paranoid loon who ended up resigning in disgrace,
   tarnishing the office, and poisoning our collective well of trust and
   optimism.  Said Hunter S. Thompson, who would've been 77 yesterday: "Of
   all the men that have run for president in the twentieth century, only
   George McGovern truly understood what a monument America could be to
   the human race."  Attention procreators: make more Georges, please.
   (And Hunters, while you're at it.)

   JEERS to our out-of-control free press.  OMG!  Have you seen the latest
   cover of Rolling Stone?  My god, it's disgusting ans I don't blame
   stores one bit for boycotting it.  Look at the ink they're giving this
   menace to society:
   Rolling Stone cover upper half July, 2013 with Willie nelson headline
   and Tsaernov pic.
   That's right.  Your eyes aren't deceiving you---it says "On the Bus
   With WILLIE NELSON."  The marijuana maniac.  The dope fiend.  The
   reefer reveler who once committed an act of treason against
   the---[please rise]---U.S of Fuckin' A---[please be seated]---by
   smoking the demon weed on [39]the White House roof.  Oh, well...I
   shouldn't be surprised.  I'd expect no less from a publication whose
   very name describes both the preparation and effect of smoking a joint.
    My advice to all you moms and dads is: make sure you go out and buy a
   copy of Rolling Stone for each of your children to read so they'll know
   what they should never buy or read.  In fact, better get 'em all a
   multi-year subscription so the lesson will really sink in over time.
   The world needs more good parents like you.

   JEERS to [DEL: yelling :DEL] opening fire in a crowded movie theater.
   On tomorrow's date one year ago, a horrible human being massacred a
   dozen people---and injured 70---who were watching a movie at a theater
   in Aurora, Colorado.  What happened in the wake of the tragedy was
   depressingly predictable: gun control advocates wisely suggested that
   this might be a good time to review our federal and state firearms
   policies so that our nation's shameful record of gun violence might be
   improved upon.  The NRA responded by scaring politicians into looking
   the other way by informing them that, "We'll be scoring you on your
   response."  Right-wing bloggers and numbskull politicians (hello,
   [40]Louie Gohmert) insisted that if only those kids at that theater had
   been allowed to be armed with Glocks, they would've been able to return
   fire Rambo-style and no one but the gunman would've been harmed.  But
   Aurora---along with the Tucson AZ, Sanford FL and Oak Creek WI
   tragedies---was still fresh enough in our collective memory to factor
   into the backlash against the gun lobby when, five months later, a
   similar event took place at an elementary school in Newtown,
   Connecticut.  Today the public is overwhelmingly in favor of
   common-sense gun-safety laws that still give all due respect to the
   precious Second Amendment.  The NRA is overwhelmingly still the
   NRA---to them carnage is a feature, not a bug.

   CHEERS to home vegetation.  I've finally figured out the difference
   between winter and summer: in winter you stay inside on weekends and
   watch TV because it's freezing outside, and in summer you stay inside
   and watch TV because it's broiling outside.  What can I say?  I'm a
   thinker.  Anyway, the weekend TV schedule starts tonight on HBO's
   [41]Real Time, when Bill Maher balances out evil with good via guests
   Grover Norquist and Dan Savage.  New DVD releases include 42 and the
   remake of Evil Dead that apparently does not suck. (Harry's full list
   is up [42]at AICN)  The baseball schedule [43]is here.  (The Yankees
   travel to Fenway with the intention of destroying the Red Sox, but in
   the immortal words of Admiral Akbar: "It's a trap!")  The British Open
   continues in Muirfield.  On [44]60 Minutes: bombs that sniff out dogs.

   On [45]Bill Moyers & Company, Baldemar Velásquez talks about "the
   ongoing David vs. Goliath struggles to ensure fairness for American
   farmworkers."  And here's your Sunday morning lineup.  Let's see how
   the male/female ratio is doing this week, shall we?  Yes, let's...

     Meet the Press: Congresscritters galore with Reps. Peter King
     (R-NY), Marcia Fudge (D-OH), Steve King (R-IA) and Joaquin Castro
     (D-TX).  Male-Female Ratio: 3-1

   CNN's turn to babysit
   John McCain this week.
   -

     CNN's State of the Union: This weekend it's Candy Crowley's turn to
     babysit John McCain while Cindy goes shopping.  Male-Female Ratio:
     1-0

     This Week: Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX); Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) and Adam
     Schiff (D-CA); roundtable with Jonathan Karl, Van Jones, Matt Dowd,
     Dana Perino, Cokie Roberts and Pierre Thomas; Orange is the New
     Black author Piper Kerman.  Male-Female Ratio: 7-3

     Face the Nation:  Least-competent-ever Speaker of the House John
     Boehner discusses how hard he works...on his tan, his golf game and
     his cork-sniffing skills; Michigan Dictator Rick Snyder (R) on the
     awesome job he's doing setting a new standard for banana republics
     around the world; yakkety-yak heads Gerald Seib, David Ignatius,
     Susan Page and Michael Scherer.  Male-Female Ratio: 5-1

     Fox GOP Talking Points Sunday: Retired Dr. Ben Carson (R) and Rep.
     Donna Edwards (D-MD) on the Zimmerman verdict; roundtable with Bill
     Kristol, Evan Bayh, Kirsten Powers and Scott Brown.  Male-Female
     Ratio: 4-2

   Final Male-Female ratio: 20-7  It's a man man man man world.  Happy
   sleeping in!

   Five years ago in C&J: July 19, 2008

   JEERS to firearms for the faithful.  Let's see...if Jesus were here on
   Earth, I wonder if he'd entice fresh converts [46]like this...

     An Oklahoma church canceled a controversial gun giveaway for
     teenagers at a weekend youth conference.  Windsor Hills Baptist had
     planned to give away a semiautomatic assault rifle until one of the
     event's organizers was unable to attend.

     The church's youth pastor, Bob Ross, said it's a way of trying to
     encourage young people to attend the event.  The church expected
     hundreds of teenagers from as far away as Canada.

   What a wimp.  Jesus would give out bazookas.  Blessed are the
   buttkickers, baby!

   -

   And just one more...

   CHEERS to the giant leap for mankind that I got to witness with my own
   5-year-old eyes.  Forty-four years ago tomorrow, at 10:56 pm eastern
   time, John Kennedy's vision to put a man on the Moon by decade's end
   was realized when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first
   humans to set foot on a heavenly body not named Earth. The entire world
   was united in awe that day---the kind of awe that our next phase of
   space exploration has to match, now that the shiny shuttles have been
   mothballed.  Here...relive the moment when the world stood still:

   IFRAME: [47]//www.youtube.com/embed/RMINSD7MmT4

   Tomorrow's anniversary will be bittersweet, seeing as it's the first
   one without Neil Armstrong.  I think when Neil died, that was when I
   really started feeling a sense of mortality.  Maybe it's because we
   always shared our August 5 birthday together at Denny's, and now those
   days are over.  [sigh]  If skies are clear tomorrow night when the full
   moon is out, you could do worse than to help fulfill [48]his family's
   wishes and "...think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink."  And for
   bonus points, nibble on some green cheese.

   Have a great weekend!  Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering
   about today?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [62]Tagging tips - [63]Search For Tags - [64]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [65]Civil
   Rights, [66]Community, [67]Congress, [68]Culture, [69]Economy,
   [70]Education, [71]Elections, [72]Energy, [73]Environment, [74]Health
   Care, [75]International, [76]Labor, [77]Law, [78]Media, [79]Meta,
   [80]National Security, [81]Science, [82]Transportation, or [83]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([84]California, [85]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   .....and finally for a song of the week ............. if you like
   reading stories about "late bloomers" than this will make you smile -
   although the lateness came more by choice than circumstance. The
   pianist/singer [599]Shirley Horn was something of a child prodigy and
   did achieve some success in her early adult years. Although possessing
   only a 2-octave voice, she became a "musician's musician" ... able to
   play uptempo but specializing in ballads - and especially noted for her
   use of "space": the silence in-between sounds that make the rendition
   of ballads compelling.

   The Washington, D.C. native began piano at age four, eventually
   entering Howard University's Junior School of Music, where she studied
   the music of Rachmaninoff and Claude Debussy (who was an influence for
   [600]Donny Hathaway a few years later). She won a scholarship at age 18
   to New York's prestigious Juilliard School but - with her family
   [601]unable to afford the incidental expenses - turned it down in order
   to enroll in Howard University.

   After graduation, she performed in Washington's noted [602]U Street
   club scene (sadly, much of which was destroyed in the 1968 riots. Her
   career turned after she travelled to New York in 1960 to record her
   first album [603]Ashes and Embers at age 26. While not a big seller, a
   copy of it reached trumpeter Miles Davis, not an easy man to impress -
   but the record impressed him.

   He invited Shirley Horn to open for him at New York's famed Village
   Vanguard and when its longtime owner [604]Max Gordon objected to
   booking an unknown artist as an opening act, Davis told him he would
   not perform without her.

   She went on to a mildly successful career for a few years, gaining
   critical reviews but never breaking into the big time. And when her
   style of piano-trio music suffered (as did many others) after the
   British Invasion, Shirley Horn resisted efforts to make her into a
   popular music singer (in the way that [605]Dinah Washington did).
   Instead, she left the music business in the later half of the 1960's
   (save for some local gigs in the Washington, D.C. area) in order to
   raise a family.

   By 1978, she felt ready to make a comeback. And while once again it did
   not make her a household name, it won her a devoted following (among
   vocal music fans and critics alike) for the next twenty-five years. The
   director of the Netherlands' [606]North Sea Jazz Festival arranged for
   her to appear at it, winning fans in Europe.

   It was in 1986 when the venerable label [607]Verve Records signed her
   that she began to be nominated for Grammys and reach a wider audience.
   She recorded with her mentor Miles Davis before his death in 1991.

   In 1992, she fulfilled a long-held desire to be backed by strings and
   worked with composer-arranger [608]Johnny Mandel on the album
   [609]Here's to Life - which spent 16 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard
   jazz chart.

   Two of her other albums, [610]I Love You, Paris - a live album - and
   [611]Light Out of Darkness (A Tribute to Ray Charles) from 1993, also
   reached number one. Notably, Shirley Horn performed with the [612]same
   rhythm section - Charles Ables (bass) and Steve Williams (drums) - for
   twenty-five years.

   Alas, Shirley's career was curtailed early last decade by diabetes.
   First, it resulted in a foot being amputated (causing her to give up
   playing piano publicly for two years). She recovered in 2004, but
   Shirley Horn [613]died the next year due to complications from that
   disease (as well as breast cancer) at the age of 71.

   Her achievements include:

   - Seven Grammy nominations (winning for [614]I Remember Miles in 1998),

   - The [615]Academie du Jazz Prix Billie Holiday from France ....

   ....for her 1988 album [616]Close Enough for Love ....

   - And she was designated a [617]National Endowment for the Arts Jazz
   Master in 2004.

   When Diana Krall produced Barbra Streisand's [618]2009 album - both
   admitted that Shirley Horn was an influence.

                     [621][Shirley4Horn_zps7b6c5a62.jpg]

   Her signature tune was the title track of that 1992 album (arranged by
   Johnny Mandel). [622]Here's to Life had music by the prolific composer
   [623]Artie Butler - who says the song came to him while watching
   [624]George Burns on the Tonight Show. He tried other lyricists, but it
   was the late [625]Phyllis Molinary who made the song complete. And
   [626]below you can listen to it.

     Funny how the time just flies
     How love can go from warm hellos to sad goodbyes
     And leave you with the memories you've memorized
     To keep your winters warm

     But there's no yes in yesterday
     And who knows what tomorrow brings
     or takes away
     As long as I'm still in the game
     I want to play
     For laughs, for life, for love

     So here's to life
     And every joy it brings
     Here's to life
     To dreamers and their dreams
     May all your storms be weathered
     And all that's good get better
     Here's to life
     Here's to love
     And here's to you

   We had our cattle at our winter place. We had taken our house/outdoors
   cat, Jeffie, with us. We were gone for a weekend, and Jeffie
   disappeared. We were afraid he was killed by a dog or coyote. A few
   months later, Jeffie showed up at the ranch. He had to have walked 70
   miles (as the crow flies), in the winter, crossing an interstate and
   several local highways, avoiding all the rangeland critters, as well.
   He was skinny, and mad as hell. He would never come in the house after
   that, but stayed around the place, eating in the barn, until he finally
   disappeared a few years later. We knew it was Jeffie, as he had a kink
   in his tail, where it had been closed in a door. Poor little Jeffie.

   I think, therefore I am. I think.

   I got 5/7 with some lucky guesses and some answers I actually knew.

   Kind of amusing to switch to the home page for the UK and not find one
   syllable about the Royal Baby.  It's said that the Prince and Duchess
   left Bucklebury "abruptly" (with their security detail) but no one
   confirmed they were en route to the hospital in London.

   I'm hoping it's a little girl because she would be the first girl in
   line to become queen in her own right at some point in the future.
   Sweden (twice over with Crown Princess Victoria and her daughter
   Princess Estelle who was born on my birthday a year and a half ago) and
   Norway (Princess Ingrid Alexandra) already have girls in the
   succession, so it would be nice if England followed suit.

   New bebes abound  ;-D  From the Royal House of Norway:

     15 July Milly Kakao - the Crown Prince and Crown Princess' family
     dog - had nine puppies. A series of photographs have now been taken
     of Their Royal Highnesses' family with the puppies.

   happened with one of her feet (caught in a trap or a snare maybe?) and

   Yesterday, July 18th, was the 77th anniversary of the start of the
   1936-39 Spanish Civil War.  I posted a two-part diary as a tribute to
   some of the 2,800 American men and women who went to Spain to fight for
   a cause near and dear to their hearts.

   Here are the links to both Parts I and II:
     * [1046]Condemned as "Premature Anti-Fascists." Is There Ever a Bad
       Time to Oppose Fascism? - Part I.
     * [1047]Condemned as "Premature Anti-Fascists." Is There Ever a Bad
       Time to Oppose Fascism? - Part II.

   I hope you read the diary.  Thank you.

       That was very generous of you.  I was quite intrigued to know that
       your mom seriously considered supporting Henry Wallace in 1948, who
       was, in his own right, a brilliant man.
       Both Wallace and Eugene Debs are on my list to write a long diary
       about.  My next one, however, will be about a man who was both
       feared and beloved by some and one whose philosophy differed
       greatly from Gandhi's during India's Independence Movement.  To say
       that he made controversial choices towards achieving that end would
       be to understate it.
       I hope to post it on August 14th evening, as India gained
       independence from the British at the stroke of Midnight on that day
       in 1947.  Now, I just have to finish writing it.

       these days.  That part, while still funny, really wouldn't be funny
       nowadays.  Besides, I am still mourning Stefan.
       Jeers to coming home from the doctor's office (making an
       appointment for blood draw in a week) to find the air conditioning
       was broken, and it was 97 outside, rapidly heading past 80 inside.
        Jeers to being told that they were booked up and the earliest they
       could deal with the aircon was on Monday.  Cheers that the woman on
       the phone realized when I said "Isn't there any time for someone to
       deal with this on the weekend? I am sick -- I will pay" that it
       might be worth investigating if they could look at it today.
       Cheers to the guy who showed up just an hour and a half later.
       Jeers to the fact that it wasn't just the compressor (he fixed
       that), it was the fan.  Jeers there wasn't one he had in his van or
       at the shop so it would be Monday or Tuesday anyway.  Cheers that
       his boss found him one and so he was back an hour later, and fixed
       the airconditioning this afternoon.  Cheers cheers cheers!!!!
       Of course, it really won't make too much difference to my sleeping,
       I guess.  One of the side effects of the induced hypothyroidism is
       insomnia.  I am realizing that more and more as the days go on.

       Last year my electric bill was through the roof for months after
       the summer because I used my air conditioner for 3 months.
         This year I have turned my air on exactly 4 times.
         And only because I had company.
         As soon as they were gone I turned it off.

       my mom liked the flowers.  But they did nothing with the peaches.
       Mom laughed that the backyard smelled of peach brandy as they fell
       and rotted.  She never tried to walk across the yard in bare feet.
        She wouldn't have laughed as much if she had tried to do so.

       I was feeling very lonely and sobbing at one point in June, and up
       popped an orange kitty to look at me questioningly as if to say

   Public service announcement:  Ramara and I are trying to bring back the
   weekly diary for "This Week in the War on Women,"  since Kaili's moved
   on.  It's going t be a group effort, so anyone who's interested, stop
   by tomorrow and sign up to take a week.  It'll be up on Saturdays at
   noon pacific, 3pm Eastern.

   Also, cheers to Queen Liz for the final ok for marriage equality.  A
   commenter at sfgate suggested her thought process went something like
   this:  "Considering the hash my kids have made of their marriages,
   same-sex couples might as well have a go."

   JEERS to having to be ready to PEE at a moment's notice once you have
   slam-dunked all the other requirements for a job.

   JEERS to people stupid enough to think this helps improve employee
   quuality or screen out "bad people".

   CHEERS to me for getting a letter from QUANTICO today. Now I have names
   of people to send stuff to in my quest to really aid in the battle

       And I really think my prospects aren't very good.
       Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the
       fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first
       existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the
       higher consideration. -- [DEL: K.Marx :DEL] A.Lincoln

   Cheers to the legislative intern for Senator Patty Murray, who is
   headed for Tonga in September to teach ESL in the Peace Corps.

   Cheers to our little garden.  Early Girl tomatoes, California Poppys.

   Jeers to the Spokane City Councilmember whose legislative priority is
   trying to cover up bikini baristas.  He might not get out much. Tis ~=
   95F and examples of behavior sure to be offensive to his delicate
   sensibilities abound without being connected to vendors of overpriced

       Kittehs are doing well, quilting is slow but steady, and I have 3

       Why can't a woman find a decent pair of tailored slacks that fit
       well? So, to hell with it. I've been sewing for 50 years, time to
       make my own pattern!

   Cheers to the rain that came though and dropped the temp from 92 to 72,
   Jeers the temp is back on the way up.

       See, when your state is shaped like, well, anyway, and it sticks
       out from the rest of the country like a...a thumb!...with water on
       three sides, the two sets of water try to show each other who's
       boss (yes, I do sound rather violent tonight, don't I?)...anyway,
       they meet in the middle of the state, beat the crap out of each
       other and you simply swap one set of hot, humid, sticky air for
       another....
       Why that's happening in Maine is beyond me.

   Getting the Jeers out first: hot and dry, with fires in the mountains
   and on the rangelands, not only in Idaho, but throughout most of the
   West; It is cold and wet where it is not needed, as well. I am sure
   each of you is dealing with one situation or the other; Jeers that
   Belle had an infection, pancreatis, but six C notes later, she appears
   recovered. But,

   CHEERS for President Obama. His very personal and softly spoken words
   about black men and racism were much needed. But,

   JEERS that the right will characterize his remarks as from an "angry
   black man." Lordy, when will the idiots lose the limelight, and also
   their positions of legislative power, nationally and in many states.
   The blatant attack on women continues, and who would believe the SCOTUS
   would undo much of the Voting Rights Act--I can hardly believe it. But,

   CHEERS for all of you. Stay strong, stay weird, get active (if you
   aren't already), and don't forget to write. Off to read Bill's
   excellence!  Love, mcmom

   MSNBC just aired Obama's remarks again in full.  I'd just caught
   snippets.

   That really was a cathartic statement he made.  And the Sunday shows
   will be all over it, in a good way for once.

   Hugs to you and the Old Timer and the critters.

   Currently watching "Wild Target," w/ Bill Nighy, who I think has moved
   up over the past 10 years to my second favorite actor ever, after
   Olivier.

   and Ron Weasley is there, too.  He's doing quite well.

   The cable folks say it's an Action/Mystery, but they're wrong.  It's a
   freakin' goofball.

       I remember the Pit and the Pendulum and I liked it.
       For a Poe fan like me I haven't seen many of the Poe movies.
         The production quality of most of them are just too awful.
         I wish a good director with some cash can re-look at some of
       those stories.
         Even a bio-pic of Poe or Price.
         I remember going to bed one night and just as I woke up the next
       morning it's hard to describe but a feeling came over me. My breath
       was taken away from me for a second.
         It was a premonition.
         I said to myself right then and there, somebody important has
       just died.
         I found out it was Vincent Price.
         I'm kind of psychic.

   You know what they say....seven days make one weak.  Or week.

   I'm tiiiiired.  (Blazing Saddles, anyone??)

   It's been a hot, humid, sticky, stinky, icky week.  But it's over and
   I'm glad!

   For the next few hours, I shall forget the entire week, focus
   completely on pleasant things, and look forward to my bowl of ice
   cream.

   For the next few hours, I shall ignore:
   My very poor showing of 3/7 on the BBC Quiz.
   The fact that there is another g.d. pile of dishes in the g.d. kitchen,
   after I just did two sinksful of g.d. dishes today in the g.d. heat.
   (g.d. does not mean "Gunther's Dear"--anybody who gets that reference
   is older than I am!  and smoochies to ya for bein' here!)
   The ongoing g.d. heat and humidity.
   My grumpiness at all of the above.

   Instead I shall be a sweet and cheery soul, if it kills me.

   my son. I'm soaking up all the time I can, as son is going back to
   college in the fall. He is in a major that will probably mean him
   having to move when he graduates. Daughter is still at home, but in
   another couple of years she will be starting college, as well.

   them!

   Another 21 mm in about 24 hours, equaling our total for the year from
   January 1 to July 17 and three times to largest amount in a 24 hour
   hour period.

   Jeers to the allotment of 5 acre 5 inches of irrigation water and even
   then Elephant Butte Reservoir at 3% of capacity, Caballo Lake at 4%.
   Politicians in Santa Fe are saying that we may have to dispense with
   agriculture - it is after all only a few percent of the total U. S.

   know I was born too early, and I belong in space.  You can't fall in

   Jeers to heat waves (if you have one of them in space, you're too close
   to something large and hot). A foot of rain in a couple of weeks and
   now three days over 95 degrees with murderous humidity are mowing down
   sensitive perennials, stripping the peach trees of peaches, sending
   root rot everywhere, killing tomatoes...My friend with the organic farm
   is seriously suffering.

   I was just a bit older than you--8 years old. I will never forget
   watching it on the little black and white TV in my parents' bedroom.
   They came in and woke my sister and I up to watch. It was a magical
   moment for the 4 of us.

   All that month we had talked about it at school. The Weekly Reader had
   articles about the upcoming moonwalk. There were concerns about what
   the men might encounter in terms of the surface being safe to land and
   walk on.

   And then--they landed and walked! It was amazing!

   I will never forget the thrill of watching :-)

   Peace, Hope, Faith, Love

       My purple basil is starting to turn green on the lower third of the
       stem. What's that all about? LOL It has such a different flavor,
       sort of like anise with a basil undertone. Have never used it but
       love growing it in the garden as a filler with a different texture
       and color.
       My sweet basil is just getting a full head of steam but it got
       started late in a patio pot. Half will be dried, the other half
       will be chopped and frozen with a little water in ice-cube trays
       for use in soups and sauces come winter.
       The thyme will be harvested this weekend so I can get another full
       harvest before Labor Day.
       Chives are - well, what can you say about chives, LOL. They are
       doing their chivey thing and my neighbors are loving all the fresh
       chives I can foist off on them.
       Peace.

       I never had any luck with purple basil. This is regular old sweet
       basil, and it's growing gangbusters.
       The mint is trying to take over the world; I keep picking it for
       tea. I love mint in my iced tea! Rosemary is doing well, and so I
       use it in cooking. What else? Oh, I have some sage. It's apparently
       a milder-flavored variety, though. Next year, I'll choose a better
       one. I've used the sage in homemade sausage; it works, but I needed
       to use more than I thought I should.
       You should see our cukes! They are total takeover mode, and putting
       out a gazillion cucumbers. So I'm making a few test jars of pickles
       this weekend, with more to come if these work out okay.

       I bought a pot of mint for my balcony today. Am hoping it tries

       basil in an emergency. Not with tomatoes, though--used it in a
       white/veggie lasagne.

   I'm growing rosemary for the first time and it's lovely!  I have it in
   an old galvanized bucket right next to the front door. I love to brush
   my hand through it when I walk by. The smell is so wonderful!

   I'll dry that at the end of summer. For now, I've been using it with a
   garlic mash (bunch of garlic and a smidge of kosher salt smashed up
   with a fork) on grilled chicken. I also like to use it with fresh lemon
   slices on baked chicken. Can't afford lamb these days which is my
   favorite way to use fresh rosemary. Yumm....

   Peace.

       Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the

       existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the

   CHEERS to some good news. When I arrived home from work yesterday I
   discovered that the construction-defect lawsuit in my building which
   had been driving us all insane for the past seven years, had been
   settled and dismissed. Spoke to the property management company this
   morning; I was told that yes indeed it was true (the court filing had
   been in the lobby by the mailboxes). This means I can refinance my
   mortgage(s) with a fixed rate loan. Rates have actually been coming
   down for the past week or two; I went to my current lender (a very big
   bank but I figure it'll save me a bit of cash and aggravation to stay
   with them instead of going elsewhere) and started the process, which is
   about the last thing I will need to take care of before I retire, apart
   of course from picking the date and submitting the application for
   that. I'd been planning to go at the end of this year but will probably
   stick around a few months longer just to pump up my pension and put
   aside more money in case the folks at OPM can't figure out how to
   calculate my pension.

   CHEERS to lemons from lemonade. Monday is a furlough day for me. Which
   means I have a three-day weekend, with the downside of course that I
   won't be paid for Monday. Because we're closing entirely it's a
   three-day weekend for the other office and (I suspect it's a bit of an
   f.u. to...well...everyone for foisting the dreaded SEQUESTER on us), we
   were given an hour off today. So the weekend started just a bit early.

   CHEERS to more lemons-from-lemonade. I was interviewed by someone from
   the Kaiser Foundation and may participate in San Francisco's "Greater
   Than AIDS" campaign this fall. It'll involve a video and a photoshoot
   (for the bus shelter posters). I could be a poster child. Yikes!

   I may as well throw in a generic JEER to cover the fact that our nation
   is still full of crazy haters who are obsessed with guns and with
   telling everyone else how to live their lives (see Robyn's diary from
   earlier today; Pat Robertson, and so on). There are undoubtedly other
   things to JEER about but I'll save those for another day.

   CHEERS to JekyllnHyde's amazing two-part diary on the Abraham Lincoln
   Brigade. He's pimped it (them?) above; go check them out. They're
   extraordinary.

   CHEERS to Bill and Michael and to everyone else who drops in here.

   It's going to be a lovely weekend and I'm going to enjoy it. I hope you
   all will do the same.

       is the, "beauty" thing. Beauty is so powerful, and so misleading.
       This may throw some off, but, let's face it, Hitler was a handsome
       man. The Elephant Man, on the other hand...not so much.
       As time has gone on, this idea that physical beauty equates to
       goodness has proliferated beyond all reason.
       It is just one more of humanities foibles that is, yet, to be
       overcome. Like, black vs white.

   and I love you so much.

   Cheers to the lil guy on the right... Actually, this pic is from last
   summer and he's grown quite a bit since then.

   Biggest of Cheers to my one and only nephew (see above). This is one
   tough, resilient booger of a kiddo (see below) and I love him so...

   Jeers that late Tuesday afternoon, he was run over by a truck...
   literally.
   He was in ICU for about 24 hours, but is in a regular room now. He has
   a broken rib, broken toe, partially collapsed lung, fractured pelvis,
   lacerated liver, broken elbow and other bruises and minor injuries.
   Thankfully, I cannot express oh how much so thankfully, he should be
   okay and is actually doing remarkably well for what he's been through.
   He just went in for surgery to get a pin or two in his elbow and adjust
   his chest tube. Yesterday, he was standing out of bed for a few steps
   and eating mac & cheese.

   Cheers to that kiddo spirit in him (He'll be 15 next week). His
   sarcastic wit and humor is still in tact. He's playing jokes on his mom
   and getting a bit bored. All in all, I call that a very welcome thing.
   I love that little guy quite a bit.

   Cheers to my sister and brother-in-law. Kerm (yes, I call my sister
   Kerm :)  ) is keeping us in the loop and we so appreciate that! I love
   them.

   Only Cheers for continued healing and recovery and profound gratitude
   that kiddo will be okay overall.

   Enjoy your weekend, folks... Have fun, stay cool, stay hydrated, eat
   well, be merry, smile, laugh... And most importantly, be sure to tell
   the ones you love just that... I love you.

       he and his friend were lying against some rocks on the side of the
       road near his friend's house... A narrow probably dirt road that
       winds around a little lake. They were on the left side on a corner.
       Some guy in a utility truck filled with stones should have been on
       the right side, but he cut the corner hard into the other "lane"
       and didn't see them there...
       I get goosebumps whenever I think about it.  Yikes.

   Cheers to summer- i know that it's been brutal, but this is what we are
   fantasizing about in february, folks, Really!!
   More cool showers, more chilled food.
   Cheers to Nature, and how she makes every morning just a little bit
   comical...
   when the Killdeer momma starts leading her chix around where i walk the
   dawg in the dawn-hours, makes for some comedy. He just has to sit and
   stay(widdle himself) until they are down the road.
   And the discovery of a very good-sized doe where 'we' are used to
   crapping in the long grass, thus calling a halt to all dogfunctions for
   at least that morning. Dawn walks on a waterway are really Cheer!
   Cheers to a little AC. I've always been a Puritan about False Cooling-
   and that is just because I blame my parents. I mean, who wouldn't? But
   the small AC machine is purring in the upstairs window, and I may sleep
   without sweatpools tonight. Just cuz it's Fryday, dammit!!

       ... in hot weather made me give in and get the first AC (I'm now on
       the second one). Well, okay - I was still working then and hot
       weather didn't allow for sleeping well, and since I needed to be
       alert for work, I just had to get enough sleep - comfortable sleep.
       Now that I have health issues and the 'feeling faint' thing has
       potential health repercussions that could adversely affect me, it's
       also a practical thing.

   It never ceases to amaze me that those, such as Heath and Madore, who
   are the first to stand up for religious liberty, are often also the
   first to try to impose their unwelcome and bigoted religious values on
   others. To Heath, Madore and the ignorant bigots who follow them, I
   would suggest that if you oppose same sex marriage, then you are simply
   free to avoid marrying someone of your own sex. Other than that, the
   means by which any two other consenting adults choose to express their
   love, commitment and devotion to each other should not be, and is not,
   any of your damned business. Butt out of the lives of others who cause
   you no harm. Just as no one has the right to decide what form your
   marriage may take, you have no right to impose your vision of marriage
   on anyone else. That's it. It's right there in the First Amendment.

   1 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.
   Juice of half a lemon.
   2 dashes of Angostura Bitters.
   1 measure Scotch.
   1 lump of ice.
   Mix and add ginger ale.

   And second, a bagpiper playing AC/DC, with flames:

   Enjoy your weekend!

       originally had CBS's Cronkite coverage, but the embed wouldn't
       work.  Got the same blank white nothingness.  Might be a copyright

   with too much money, here's a great way to blow a bunch of it.

   1. Fly to San Francisco or San Jose.

   2. Rent a convertible(or a town car & driver, remember, you're blowing
   money here).

   3. Go to Carmel-by-the-Sea.

   4. Check into The Inn at Spanish Bay.

   5. Drink all afternoon on the patio, which looks out over the ocean &
   Monterey Penninsula.

   6. Stay coherent until close to sunset--that's when the bagpiper
   follows the last group of golfers for the last 3-4 holes on The Links
   at Spanish Bay. The 18th hole is next to the Inn, so, in your
   inebriated state, you'll get to enjoy the s-l-o-w-l-y moving bagpiper
   as he moves closer & closer to the Inn. You're drunk, you're in one of
   the most beautiful places on Earth, sitting on an outside patio with
   mega-comfy chairs & outdoor fireplaces, listening to a bagpiper loft
   his notes through the Cypress trees... You may just cry--it is that
   good.

       pure hell, coping with the loss of Heidi & Ricky. I've had major
       meltdowns. When I'm not hanging around kos whining about it, I'm
       scouring rescue orgs all over AZ & CA.
       So far, the dogs that seem the most appealing in pics are snapped
       up right away, have serious health problems, or are too aggressive
        with our 13 yr old yorki-poo.
       Today we're going out to interview several candidates. One is of
       particular interest--a 2 year old terrier mix. We've been told he
       has a super sweet disposition, is quiet and affectionate, and has
       been brought back to full health after being rescued from a
       hoarder. The last qualification is the most important to us.
       No matter what we end up with, tho, within a couple months it'll be
       miserably spoiled and demanding, disobedient and noisy. For some
       reason that's happened with every dog we've ever owned. :)
       Hope you are still enjoying your travels. I could very easily adapt
       to the life of a full time RVer as long as I had my hounds along
       for the ride!

   to fly, I drove up from So Cal. I also didn't drink all afternoon on
   the patio, drat. Maybe next time. I did have a few glasses of wine on
   my balcony though as I watched and listened to the bagpipe player. It
   is an amazingly beautiful place. I went in the off season, when the
   weather was unseasonably warm, and stayed for three days. I went by
   myself, which is another story, and took long walks on the beaches,
   went shopping, toured around the area, ate great meals, drank great
   wine, etc.  On the same road trip, I also stayed two nights at the Post
   Ranch Inn in Big Sur, another must do if you ever find yourself with
   too much money and even less sense. Another mega beautiful, once in a
   lifetime kind of place along the California coast. Big Sur is much more
   rustic and quiet compared to Carmel, but the Post Ranch Inn is luxury
   all the way. This was the view from my cliff-side room:

   And I don't think I will ever forget the down topped bed I slept in.
   They had a cat who lived on the property, I want to come back in my
   next life as that cat.

   I remember my first night at The Inn at Spanish Bay thinking, wow, am I
   lucky. Best wishes.

       I know what you mean, feeling you were lucky.
       While I was sitting among the swells & well-heeled on the patio
       sipping my I-don't-even-wanna-know-what-this-costs Grey Goose
       martini, I kept feeling as if they were going to come by & ask me
       to leave, having discovered my broke-ass interloping....but I
       fooled 'em right through the time the 'staff' brought our car
       around.
       Heh. My wife & I argued right before we left. We were in the gift
       shop and I wanted a Pebble Beach pint glass. It was stupid
       expensive--like $25. I really wanted it as a souvenir, so, of
       course we bickered for 20 seconds. Still have the glass.  :)  (I
       think my argument was "I just dropped $1200 this weekend on your

   JEERS to HGTV's "Renovation Raiders." This is a series where a crew of
   experts come in and remodel a room in somebody's house while the owners
   are out to dinner. One spouse or the other is in on the ruse, and a
   helper-spy follows them to the restaurant and reports back to the
   remodelers if for any reason the couple is coming home earlier than
   expected. If they are, the helper-spy has to do something to "delay"
   them. As far as I can tell, that can be anything from staging a mugging
   or slashing their tires in the parking lot.

   All through this show, the remodeling crew dashes nervously about,
   trying to scare viewers into thinking the couple might come home before
   they're finished, even though we KNOW that ain't gonna happen. For one
   thing, they're always 100 miles away, stuffing their pie holes with a
   20-course meal, and for another, we wouldn't be seeing the damn episode
   if they'd come home early and spoiled shit.

   But what I'm really here to JEER about is the promo ad for Renovation
   Raiders. The star stands there wiggling & winking like Sarah Freakin'
   Palin, and doing a pouty-mouth thing that makes her look like a
   strawberry blonde sea bass.

   IMHO, this promo takes attention away from a REALLY COOL HGTV duo, The
   Property Brothers. THOSE dudes know how to give women what we really
   want: a new jacuzzi tub, a walk-in closet, and some of that hot
   Canadian twin bootie.

   That is all.

       you and your wasting of perfectly good paste?
       Okay, I apologize. that was out of line. I also apologize for the

       staining, but I am truly sorry y'all need to ride around with them

       Since the paste heels didn't get me out of Co Spgs I can make gravy

   Cheers for the call coming before Mr. L & I had had a chance to make
   the most of finally having the house to ourselves after our visitors of
