[24]GOP helped kill legislation sponsored by Obama that would have protected
the AP

   President Obama takes question at a news conference
   Rather than defend the government's overreach, Obama should revive his
   media shield law
   Darrell Issa is [30]outraged that the Department of Justice
   [31]secretly obtained phone records through a subpoena of the AP's
   telecommunications provider. He's right to condemn the action, but as
   nycsouthpaw [32]points out, it's worth remembering that Issa voted
   against legislation that would have protected the AP:

     Issa was one of 21 House members who opposed the Free Flow of
     Information Act of 2007, a measure that would have forbidden federal
     investigators from compelling journalists to give evidence without
     first obtaining a court order. The bill included a section that
     specifically forbid subpoenaing journalists' phone records from
     "communication service providers" to the same extent that the law
     protected the journalists themselves.

   The legislation passed the House, but it was [33]filibustered by
   Republicans in the Senate and opposed by the Bush Administration.
   Barack Obama, at the time a U.S. Senator, didn't vote on the bill, but
   was a co-sponsor. So you have a situation where Issa and Senate
   Republicans opposed legislation that would have prevented a government
   action they now decry, and you have a president who supported the
   legislation but whose administration is now responsible for taking the
   actions his legislation was supposed to prevent.

   Thus far, the president hasn't addressed the DOJ's actions. Yesterday,
   White House Press Secretary Jay Carney [34]tried to take a neutral
   posture, saying that the White House was unaware of the subpoena until
   the AP announced it yesterday and referring all questions to the DOJ.

   Given the president's support for the press shield legislation in the
   Senate, he's at risk of being as hypocritical on this issue as Issa and
   most Senate Republicans--without having the added virtue of being
   right. But if he wasn't involved in the decision to subpoena the
   records, he could help make up for the government's overreach not only
   by saying it was wrong to subpoena copies of AP phone records, but also
   by harnessing the GOP's new civil libertarian streak to push through
   the legislation that they killed just a few short years ago.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       My hope is that instead of defending the subpoena, Obama says it's
       clear we need a shield law put in place. It's bad that it happened,
       but hopefully instead of hunkering down, he decides to try to fix
       some of the damage by pushing things in the other direction.

       twists anything this administration does and always lays the blame
       on the GOP. Embarrassing. Here's Greenwald on this very subject.
       [251]http://www.guardian.co.uk/...

     The all-too-familiar axis that has enabled massive civil liberties
     assaults by the Obama administration - blindly partisan progressive
     media outlets and particularly obsequious self-styled neutral
     journalists - instantly sprung into action here and wasted no time
     jumping to the defense of the US government. TPM's Josh Marshall,
     while saying "there's still a very live question of whether this was
     a prudent action on the part of the DOJ", actually published an
     anonymous letter depicting the Obama DOJ as the victim here, saying
     AP "seeks to smear Justice" (in the annals of lowly journalistic
     behavior, printing anonymous emails defending the US government's
     surveillance actions and attacking targeted journalists is way down
     in the sewer, but that's the government-defending Josh Marshall in
     the Age of Obama). Similarly: before most people had even learned of
     the story, Think Progress purported to explain "Why The Department
     Of Justice Is Going After The Associated Press' Records" and, of
     course, offered the most benign and generous interpretation
     possible: they only did it to find out who is responsible for an
     "unauthorized and dangerous disclosure of classified information",
     quoting CIA Director John Brennan (offering instant "explainers" for
     even the most dubious of Obama administration actions is its typical
     tactic).

     Some progressives actually tried to blame Republicans for the Obama
     DOJ's conduct because the GOP largely voted against the codification
     of some added protections for journalists from DOJ record-gathering
     in a proposed "shield law". But Obama, who supported those
     protections when he was in the Senate, "reversed course" when he was
     president - that could easily be the motto of his presidency - and
     it was his opposition that helped kill that bill

   Everyone, including some in here, that supported the campaign change to

   You can't go crazy with subpeonas on one leak, but not others like the

   Not to mention, AP held story.  And they still swept in.  This is just

   But, that's one of the problems with this nightmare scenario, that
   never seems to be discussed.

   If a Democratic President signs a law 'cutting' Social Security and
   Medicare--he throws his, and his parties' credibility, 'clean
   out-the-window' on many issues!

   Check out this piece in The Atlantic:

     [586]Obama's War on Whistle-Blowers

     The extent to which the administration is prosecuting leakers has
     troubled those who see leakers as speakers of truth to power.

     "In President Obama's 26 months in office, civilian and military
     prosecutors have charged five people in cases involving leaking
     information, more than all previous presidents combined," reports
     the Times. Here's a list of prominent leakers with various agendas
     currently under pressure from the government. . . .

   I haven't exactly heard any 'hue and cry' from so-called Progressive
   Dem politicians regarding this issue in the past.  Why would we expect
   that they would take this up as an issue in 2016?

   No, expect the standard fare in 2016--wedge issues.

       All Holder is is a buffer. If his buffer integrity is compromised,

       Obama himself is a buffer. If he goes Biden will faithfully carry

 Did Obama bring this up? ([799]0+ / 0-)

   Or, as usual, is the White House waiting for the rest of us to "carry
   their water"?

     Given the president's support for the press shield legislation in
     the Senate, he's at risk of being as hypocritical on this issue as
     Issa and most Senate Republicans--without having the added virtue of
     being right.

   Oh what a tangled web we weave.

 The Problem Is That I Believe That Presidents ([802]2+ / 0-)

          [803]Lovepolitics2008, [804]glynis

   believe that when classified information is leaked and the press puts
   out information that endangers American lives that the government has
   the responsibility to do something about it.  I am one of a minority
   who believe that even the media is not above the law when it
   compromises Americans lives.  The AP put out information that damaged
   an operation that would have more than likely saved lives or at the
   least stopped the bad guys.  There are differences between whistle
   blowers who give out information on the truth of things that are being
   done wrong and those who give out information that endangers American
   lives.  I am not sure I am in favor of shielding the media when it
   comes to the security of people's lives.  Maybe the law can be
   re-written in a way that shields the media on whistle blowers, but not
   on those who abuse classified information.

       stuff willy nilly.  The Government has always had that claim, and
       courts have generally erred in their favor.  However, the burden of
       proof is on the government, not the citizen (or the press, who is
       the citizen proxy here).  Also, classified information is only
       classified to the government officials in charge of babysitting it.
        If you got your hands on some, you have no obligation to keep it
       classified - indeed if you think the public's right to know is
       compelling, the law is on your side.
       The AP put out information before the White House but after the
       info was going to be a problem (from the negotiation).  They robbed
       the WH of a breathless Mission Accomplished headline, that's it.
       There is no need to have a new law.  Indeed, what we are talking
       about is a despotic zeal to attack whistleblowers and the press,
       one that Obama's team has taken on with an unprecedented thirst.

   Why would Obama want to investigate them? And why would it bother the

   Please.

   If they were exploring leaks, they could have served subpoenae and
   given AP notice and the opportunity to quash them if they were deemed
   too broad.  Instead, DOJ conducted a wide ranging fishing expedition
   into the personal phone records of dozens of journalists.    Don't act

   This asshole is more concerned with going after cannabis growers and

   This kind of shit can actually bring a presidency down in flames.

   If Obama wants people like me to believe that he wasn't part of the
   problem here, the best way to start is to fire this asshole.

   You can try to blame the GOP all you want, but Democrats helped put
   these fascist policies in place, because they were pissing their pants
   right along with Republicans after 9/11.

   A lot of us tried to warn them at the time, because no administration
   gives up power, even with a (D) after the name.

   Frankly this kind of shit is a big reason why investigating the last
   group of criminals was taken "off the table".

   That was the Democrats' way of pleading the 5th...

   opposed a measure to protect journalists but is now crying foul when

   Whereas:

   Obama supported the measure to protect journalists but, now that he is

   journalists.

   Ah, Mercutio, were thou wise: "A plague on both your houses!"

   [857]White House Proposes Changes in Bill Protecting Reporters'
   Confidentiality
   by Charles Savage, Sept. 30, 2009

     WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration has told lawmakers that it
     opposes legislation that could protect reporters from being
     imprisoned if they refuse to disclose confidential sources who leak
     material about national security, according to several people
     involved with the negotiations.

     The administration this week sent to Congress sweeping revisions to
     a "media shield" bill that would significantly weaken its
     protections against forcing reporters to testify.

     The bill includes safeguards that would require prosecutors to
     exhaust other methods for finding the source of the information
     before subpoenaing a reporter, and would balance investigators'
     interests with "the public interest in gathering news and
     maintaining the free flow of information."

     But under the administration's proposal, such procedures would not
     apply to leaks of a matter deemed to cause "significant" harm to
     national security. Moreover, judges would be instructed to be
     deferential to executive branch assertions about whether a leak
     caused or was likely to cause such harm, according to officials
     familiar with the proposal.

     The two Democratic senators who have been prime sponsors of the
     legislation, Charles E. Schumer of New York and Arlen Specter of
     Pennsylvania, said on Wednesday that they were disappointed by the
     administration's position.

   Basically, as Sen. Specter noted, the president's proposal would gut
   judicial review.

   Like Mr. Obama's promise on "fixing FISA" after he was elected
   president, this post is only a half truth, I expected better of this
   site.
