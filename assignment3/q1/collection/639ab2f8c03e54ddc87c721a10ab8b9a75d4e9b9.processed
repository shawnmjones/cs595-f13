       As we first reported on Monday, Governor Rick Scott's re-election
       campaign planned to hold a [40]"private gator hunt" in New Smyrna
       Beach on Oct. 18. Attendees were being asked to contribute $25,000
       to the "Let's Get To Work" committee formed to promote his
       campaign.
       Tonight, the committee announced that the event has been canceled.
       Steve Bousquet of the Tampa Bay Times [41]reports that Scott, at an
       "It's Your Money" tax-cut event on Tuesday afternoon in downtown
       Fort Lauderdale, brushed off a question about the event and told a
       reporter to contact the Republican Party of Florida, even though
       the invitations made clear that Scott's campaign was handling
       reservations.
       A few hours later, Tallahassee lawyer John French, who runs Scott's
       campaign organization, Let's Get to Work, said the event was off.
       "As you know, I serve as the chairman of Let's Get to Work. This
       event has been canceled," French said in an email Tuesday night.
       News of Scott raising money from the killing of one of the state's
       signature animals went viral today, with the story making its way
       to The Huffington Post and POLITICO.

            @SaintPetersblog does he really know how to hunt? Would think
            he's more of a fox hunter if anything #sayfie
