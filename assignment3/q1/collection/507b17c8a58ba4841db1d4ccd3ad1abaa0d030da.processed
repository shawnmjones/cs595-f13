[22]Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: Generational change and the Supremes

   [29][DKE_normal.jpg] According to @FiveThirtyEight, both MT & MO should
   support same-sex marriage before 2018 [30]http://t.co/...
   -- [31]@DKElections via [32]bitly
   [33]Nate Silver:

     The Supreme Court will hear arguments this week on two cases related
     to same-sex marriage, the first involving a California referendum
     that barred gay marriage, the other involving a federal law that
     prevents the government from recognizing same-sex unions. A variety
     of outcomes are possible, but it seems prudent to take stock of
     public opinion on same-sex marriage before the decisions come
     down...

     In the past, we have sometimes considered the possibility that
     support for same-sex marriage is increasing at a faster rate than
     before. The data seems to suggest, however, that the increase in
     support has been reasonably steady since about 2004.

   [34]NY Times:

     As the Supreme Court on Tuesday weighed the very meaning of
     marriage, several justices seemed to have developed a case of
     buyer's remorse. Some wondered aloud if the court had moved too fast
     to address whether gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional
     right to marry.

     "I just wonder if this case was properly granted," said Justice
     Anthony M. Kennedy, who probably holds the decisive vote.

   As to what it all means, see our own [35]Adam B and see also [36]Tom
   Goldstein:

     At least insofar as the oral argument is revealing, the puzzle of
     Hollingsworth is how the Court will "get to five" - how five members
     of the Court will agree on the judgment.

     This is a recurring dilemma when there is a threshold question in
     the case - here, the petitioners' standing to defend Proposition 8.
      The problem gets even bigger when you add in the possibility that
     one or more members of the Court do not want to decide the case at
     all - here, Justice Kennedy's suggestion that the writ of certiorari
     should be dismissed.

     In a lot of cases, these issues don't affect the outcome of the
     case, so the Court does not have to really confront them.  If one
     Justice thinks a party lacks standing and another Justice won't
     decide the case, then five of the remaining Justices may still agree
     on an outcome.  The other two are irrelevant.

     But when the Court is closely divided, things can get messy.
     Hollingsworth may be such a case.

   More politics and policy below the fold, including doctor peer
   pressure.

   Well, this seems like a big deal. [37]Post and Courier (SC):

     Lawmaker revises bill that would keep doctors from discussing gun
     safety

     n Upstate lawmaker is changing a bill he introduced in the state
     House of Representatives that would ban doctors from discussing gun
     safety with their patients.

     Rep. Joshua Putnam, R-Piedmont, said backlash from doctors around
     the state has forced him to reconsider the original intent of House
     Bill 3416.

   Doctors, especially pediatricians, were not silent on this. AFAIK
   [38]every attempt to gag doctors so far has failed. More of the story
   [39]here.

   More on today's Topic A from [40]Peter Weber/The Week:

     Neither proponents nor opponents can be completely sure, but here
     are six possible explanations for the rapid shift toward accepting
     same-sex marriage

   [41]Gavin Wright/NY Times:

     In a sense, mobilization of business support for gay rights has been
     easier and faster than mobilization for racial equality. But the two
     revolutions are of course historically linked. By opening the
     American workplace to diversity, the successes of the 1960s and
     1970s paved the way for subsequent liberation movements.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       a constitutional amendment was added to the state's constitution
       guaranteeing a right to hunt.  Part of this is due to changing
       populations make some forms of hunting, such as "road hunting
       (using dogs to drive deer out of woods into the local roads where
       hunters sitting in the right of way then shoot them.  There have
       been several close calls as traffic picks up and  fewer and fewer
       people are "dog hunters") and the other segment was the militia
       types who think this will trump any federal regulations governing
       guns.
       OTOH this is not quite as bad as previous attempts to return SC to
       the gold standard or to outlaw federal money and have the state
       issue its own script.  Sometimes, SC makes GA and FL look
       positively sane

   require a war on information.

   GOP kowtows to NRA, blocks/bans all research into gun violence. How
   such research gets actually banned and not done is sort of surprising,
   on one hand, but it truly shows how venal and anti-YOU the GOP and its
   ilk are.

   GOP - Reagan - blocked all research that would show ANY positive impact
   of cannabis (mara-ju-wanna). That research got done anyway and we now
   know that the canncbis pant is [176]chock full of medical promise.
   Gee..... why doesn't the GOP want you to know about something that can
   save lives and cure illness?

   I learned sometime recently, also rather shocking, there is no real
   data base to search to gather exact numbers on people killed by police
   (those are gun deaths too.)

   Information is POWER and those who seek to deny YOU information intend
   to deny YOU power to make important decisions about YOUR life.

   Bad people at work.

 As Greg says, banning MD speech fails. ([191]0+ / 0-)

   The federal government tried something similar years ago after
   California voters approved medical marijuana.  They went after the
   licenses of doctors who merely discussed medical marijuana with
   patients and recommended its use in appropriate cases.

   A San Francisco doctor named Marcus Conant (whom you might remember
   from Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On) sued the government
   and won.  In [192]Conant v. Walters, 309 F.3d 629 (9th Cir. 2002), the
   Ninth Circuit concluded the government's actions violated the First
   Amendment rights of doctors and patients.

   This is really no different.  It should be obvious to anyone that guns
   present a threat to life and health.  Forbidding doctors from
   discussing such an important health issue with their patients serves no
   public health purpose.  The only goal of this kind of legislation is to
   muzzle any doctor/patient discussions that might result in patients
   deciding that it's better not to own a gun.

   Seriously, I have wondered why physicians have not protested against
   legislated medicine such as unneccessary gynacological procedures and
   similar dictates that have no basis in medical need.

   Telling doctors that they are prohibited from asking their patients a
   question about guns in the home seems to violate the doctor / patient
   relationship.

 Meta: Questions about diaries & rec list ([318]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [319]commonmass, [320]tb mare, [321]Amber6541

   This is not meant as a diary-whore or a whine, honest; I'm just
   wondering...

   I wrote a diary last night (Inexpert thoughts on today's Supreme Court
   arguments.) It took a few minutes to show up on the Recent Diary list,
   which surprised me; but then, I haven't written a diary in several
   months.

   I was pleasantly surprised to see the diary spotlighted this morning.
   Sometime later this morning, it appeared to be on the Rec List. (I
   guess I can say it was on the Rec List, but I'm being cautious.) Then I
   edited the diary to add a plug for another diarist's related diary.
   When I refreshed the front page, my diary was gone from the Rec List.
   Not just from the front page, but from at least the first four pages of
   the Rec List.

   So I'm wondering: Is it common for diaries to take some time to appear
   in the Recent Diaries list? Does editing a diary now affect its
   standing on the Rec List? And when a diary drops off the Rec List,
   shouldn't it still appear if you click the "next" link for the Rec
   List? And finally, should I add a "Recommended" tag, or is that
   supposed to be added automatically?

   I think she has it exactly correct. The Supreme Court will do precisely
   what it wants to do, and IT DOESN'T MATTER, because if it's a decision
   unfavorable to marriage equality, the states will keep on doing exactly
   what they have been doing. Her analogy is to the women's movement, and
   it's just this isn't going to take as long, considering that Mattachine
   had its first meetings 62 years ago.

   I'd prefer not to be dead when this is all settled, but I can wait a
   few years.
