U.S. official cites misconduct in Japanese American internment cases

Acting Solicitor Gen. Neal Katyal says one of his predecessors, Charles Fahy,
deliberately hid from the Supreme Court a military report that Japanese
Americans were not a threat in World War II.

   [140]May 24, 2011|By David G. Savage, Washington Bureau
     * [141]Fred Korematsu was a defendant in a Supreme Court case that
       upheld the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans. His conviction
       eventually was set aside, and he was awarded the Presidential Medal
       of Freedom by President Clinton. He died in Marin County in 2005.

   Fred Korematsu was a defendant in a Supreme Court case that upheld the
   U.S....

   Reporting from Washington -- Acting Solicitor Gen. Neal Katyal, in an
   extraordinary admission of misconduct, took to task one of his
   predecessors for hiding evidence and deceiving the Supreme Court in two
   of the major cases in its history: the World War II rulings that upheld
   the detention of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans.

   IFRAME: [142]about:blank

   Katyal said Tuesday that Charles Fahy, an appointee of President
   Franklin D. Roosevelt, deliberately hid from the court a report from
   the Office of Naval Intelligence that concluded the Japanese Americans
   on the West Coast did not pose a military threat. The report indicated
   there was no evidence Japanese Americans were disloyal, were acting as
   spies or were signaling enemy submarines, as some at the time had
   suggested.

   Fahy was defending Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, which authorized
   forced removals of Japanese Americans from "military areas" in 1942.
   The solicitor general, the U.S. government's top courtroom attorney, is
   viewed as the most important and trusted lawyer to appear before the
   Supreme Court, and Katyal said he had a "duty of absolute candor in our
   representations to the court."

   Katyal, 41, who is of Indian American heritage and is the first Asian
   American to hold the post, said he decided "to set the record straight"
   Tuesday at a Justice Department event honoring Asian Americans and
   Pacific Islanders.

   He said that two of the government's civilian lawyers had told Fahy it
   would be "suppression of evidence" to keep the naval intelligence
   report from the high court.

   "What does Fahy do? Nothing," Katyal said.

   Instead, Fahy told the justices the government and the military agreed
   the roundup of Japanese Americans was required as a matter of "military
   necessity." Roosevelt issued the order on Feb. 19, 1942, about two
   months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, which plunged the U.S.
   into World War II.

   In 1943, the high court unanimously upheld a curfew imposed on Japanese
   Americans in the case of Gordon Hirabayashi vs. United States. And in
   1944, the court in a 6-3 decision upheld the removal order imposed on
   Japanese Americans in Fred Korematsu vs. United States. The majority
   accepted the government's claim that it was a matter of "military
   urgency."

   Scholars and judges have denounced the World War II rulings as among
   the worst in the court's history, but neither the high court nor the
   Justice Department had formally admitted they were mistaken -- until
   now.

   "It seemed obvious to me we had made a mistake. The duty of candor
   wasn't met," Katyal said.

   Korematsu, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by
   President Clinton, died in Marin County in 2005 at age 86. On Tuesday,
   his daughter Karen said she was grateful that Katyal had acknowledged
   the mistakes of his predecessor.

   "It was a remarkable statement he made," she said. "It proves what my
   father believed all along -- that removing the Japanese Americans was
   wrong and incarcerating them was unconstitutional."

   Korematsu was sent to a camp in Utah, one of 10 in the country.
   California had two, Tule Lake and Manzanar.

   IFRAME: [143]about:blank

   Katyal said that last summer he was doing research for several
   immigration cases when he came upon some ugly, disturbing comments
   about Asians in 19th century briefs submitted to the Supreme Court.
   Chinese immigrants were described as "people not suited to our
   institutions." People from India were described as a "subject race."

   He then looked into the history of the World War II internment cases,
   including documents revealed in the 1980s. Peter Irons, a professor at
   UC San Diego, had found reports in old government files that showed the
   U.S. military did not see Japanese Americans as a threat in 1942. His
   research led to federal court hearings that set aside the convictions
   of Korematsu and Hirabayashi. Congress later voted to have the nation
   apologize and pay reparations to those who were wrongly held.

   Katyal said he decided it was important to publicly acknowledge the
   mistakes made in the solicitor general's office. Hiding the truth from
   the justices, he said, "harmed the court, and it harmed 120,000
   Japanese Americans. It harmed our reputation as lawyers and as human
   beings, and it harmed our commitment to those words on the court's
   building: Equal Justice Under Law."

   Hirabayashi is now 93 and living in Canada. His memory of the World War
   II years has faded, said his nephew Lane Hirabayashi, a professor of
   Asian American studies at UCLA. "I know Gordon would be very pleased by
   this. He didn't know at the time that government prosecutors had
   distorted evidence. However, he knew in his heart that mass
   incarceration was unconstitutional," he said.

   "I thought it was good and very long overdue," Irons said of Katyal's
   statement. "This was a deliberate, knowing lie by Fahy to the Supreme
   Court. For the government's highest counsel to make that statement now
   is quite noteworthy and admirable."

   A year ago, Katyal became the acting solicitor general when Elena Kagan
   was nominated to the Supreme Court. He had made a name for himself in
   legal circles in 2006 when took on the case of Salim Hamdan, who faced
   a military trial at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He won in
   the Supreme Court, which struck down the military commissions because
   they had not been authorized by Congress.

   But that victory in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld earned him some critics in the
   Senate -- and it may have cost him the chance to win Senate
   confirmation as solicitor general. This year, President Obama passed
   over Katyal and nominated Deputy White House Counsel Donald Verrilli
   Jr. for the post. Katyal said he would step down when the Senate
   officially confirmed Verrilli.
