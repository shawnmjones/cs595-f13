[23]Veteran Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin to retire after the 2014 elections

   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA) will leave the Senate after 30 years of service.
   For the second time this week, a veteran member of the United States
   Senate has announced that he will be exiting the Congress after the
   2014 midterms. This time, the loss will be a great one, as Senate
   institution [30]Tom Harkin announced his decision to retire:

     U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin will not seek re-election in 2014, the Iowa
     Democrat said Saturday.

     The 73-year-old Harkin told the Associated Press in an interview,
     "It's just time to step aside," noting that by the time he would
     finish a sixth term, he would be 81.

     Harkin said the move also would allow a new generation of Democrats
     to seek higher office.

   Harkin will wrap up four decades in Washington upon his retirement, as
   he served for a decade as a member of Congress representing the state's
   now-defunct 5th district before getting elected to the Senate in 1984.
   It was then, in the midst of the Reagan landslide, that the liberal
   Harkin easily defeated Republican Sen. Roger Jepsen. He fought back a
   couple of serious challenges to his seat before earning a breather in
   2008, when he defeated Republican Christopher Reed in a landslide.

   Harkin also briefly ran for president in 1992, losing in the Democratic
   primaries to Bill Clinton.

   Harkin's retirement could easily open the floodgates for very
   competitive primaries on both sides of the Senate battle. It is
   conceivable that all four House members could engage in the open Senate
   seat, though much of the Senate discussion on the Democratic side has
   focused on fourth-term Rep. Bruce Braley, who represents the
   northeastern part of the state.

   Republicans, meanwhile, could have a classic
   establishment-versus-teabagger battle royale on their hands, as [31]the
   perpetually entertaining darling of the far Right, Rep. Steve King, was
   mulling a bid even before Harkin's retirement. The NRSC and RNC, one
   must assume, will be begging veteran Rep. Tom Latham (who represents
   Des Moines) to make a bid. It is pretty hard to see, however, how
   Latham could cobble together a majority of the Republican primary vote
   against King.

   Harkin becomes the third Senate retiree in recent weeks, joining
   Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Democratic Sen. Jay
   Rockefeller of West Virginia.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       I mean Secretary of Agri is very powerful and important for Iowa,
       and he could have the gig the next four years. Also if King is the
       GOP candidate, it would open up the seat his wife ran in and lost
       against King in 2012 - maybe she tries there again.

       there are options.  He could wait for Grassley to retire in 2016
       possibly.  Hopefully Christie does run again against King.  That
       would mean the Vilsack team could be running against him in the
       house and senate but it is just a thought.
       Again, Braley is probably the number one option and would most
       likely defeat any R in the race.

 The GOP has a lock on IA 04 ([167]0+ / 0-)

   They have a 50,000 vote advantage of registered R v. D. Last year was
   the best chance to beat Steve King. Christie Vilsack lost by 30,000
   votes. I doubt if she will try again. Given all the crazy things King
   has said, it's hard to imagine anything he could do to that would cause
   him to lose re-election.

   If King decides to run for Senate, he would probably lose. (Yea!)
   Whoever emerges from a GOP primary for IA-04 would be the odds-on
   favorite to win the general.

       In most cases, incumbents have an advantage, but I think King is
       actually something of a liability.  A more standard-fare Republican
       would clean up in that district; King (sorta like Michele Bachmann)
       makes things difficult on himself by being a loon.

 From the last PPP poll for 2014 in Iowa ([195]0+ / 0-)
       T Harkin +5% over T Branstad
       T Vilsack +3% over T Branstad
       T Branstad +2% over C Culver
       T Branstad +4% over B Braley
       T Harkin +9% over T Latham
       T Harkin +11% over S King
       From these numbers I think the US House representatives of both
       sides are in a very close level with T Vilsack and T Branstad
       making a difference for both sides, with advantage for T Vilsack
       over T Branstad.
       I think it would be smart to take profit from the advantage of T
       Vilsack. He would have likely as easy bid as T Harkin, because I
       doubt a lot that T Branstad or T Latham would risk all in a race vs
       T Vilsack. I think they would wait to the retirement of C Grassley
       if T Vilsack runs.

   Braley is the likely candidate for Senate, and there are some
   contenders to run against Branstache for Governor like Jack Hatch or
   Tyler Olson.

   It's also that Republicans have weak candidates and the party's

       He is the principal champion in congress of medical quackery. It's
       because of Harkin that the FDA can't put a stop to the "natural
       medicine" scams that rip off consumers and now and again kill them.
       If he goes, maybe we can put a stop to these frauds.

       [372]Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Herbalife) gets cash for Institute after
       legislative favors.
       "[373]The simple fact that Senator Harkin co-wrote the execrable
       Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) with
       the multi-talented Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT&founding Festival
       member) would be qualification enough, but Tommy Boy has engaged in
       more recent stupid.
       Harkin followed up DSHEA by creating the Office of Alternative
       Medicine in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which morphed
       into the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
       (NCCAM).  By alternative, we mean therapeutic approaches that are
       not embraced by conventional medicine, by which we mean approaches
       lacking scientific evidence and plausibility.
       Like a mildly abusive parent, Harkin has publicly expressed
       disappointment in the performance of his intellectually challenged
       brainchild:
           One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and
       validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly
       that it has fallen short. It think quite frankly that in this
       center and in the office previously before it, most of its focus
       has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and
       approving.
       A lay person might, naively, think that NCCAM existed to
       scientifically test alternative modalities based on the idea that
       NIH is a science-based organization, not faith-based (e.g.,
       Treasury Department).  Not so.  While NCCAM has been doing a lot of
       investigating (about $120 million per year recently), it has not
       nearly enough validating for Senator Harkin.  I don't know about
       you; but when I pony up $108, I expect either validation of my
       preconceived notions or sweet AIG bonuses, take your pick.  "
       I say good riddance to him.

   alternative to actual medicine, and that most of it is useless or very

   And while I may disagree with Tom Harkin on this issue, that doesn't

   "retire" in the case of senators or members of congress is generally

   including Sen.  Kerry, Sen. Cleland but Tom Harkin is by far my
   favorite senator ever.  He not only is genuine but he wrote me several
   times and encouraged me to keep helping veterans.  He supported our
   little org and maybe because of Sen.  Harkin I wanted it to stay small.
    He talked to me about his own veteran life and I really really really
   hate to see him go.   He took a lot of flack from veterans in Iowa
   because he believed it was consitutional and it is to burn the flag.
   My husband said he fought under a flag and that flag guaranteed the
   freedom to burn it.  Harkin had the same view.  It may not be what
   people like but you cannot have freedom of expression and then not the
   freedom to express it.

   He stood on the principle of freedom of expression and had the courage
   to answer the question without lying.

       leaving is like saying you want to spend more time with your

 If the filibuster issue ([1032]0+ / 0-)

       He could have done that while still being gracious: "I'd been
       leaning toward retiring anyway, I've wanted to spend more precious
       time with my wife, but the obstruction in Congress and the
       difficulties of getting anything meaningful done in this body have

       Another Dem possibility is Chet Culver, who's been making noise

       Apparently I understood wrong then.
       Anyone have any idea how popular he is now?  Would he have had a
       better chance in a stronger year for the Democrats, or would it
       have been 50/50 either way?

   ...especially since I expect King will be the GOP nominee. With Harkin
   gone, the temptation for him to run will be too great and I can't see
   anyone beating him in the GOP primary. (Latham will likely be scared
   off.)

   So Harkin's retirement may well end up ridding us of Steve King.

 Thanks for the link to VoteSmart. Depressing ([1177]0+ / 0-)
       though.
       Appears that everyone is "throwing seniors under the bus."
       Saw absolutely no mention of seniors/social safety net issues
       listed.  [unless I overlooked it]
       Including, among the 14 subgroups under "Family and Children."  I
       worry that this is just the tip of the iceberg.
       Here we're been though a couple of years of nothing but talk of
       fiscal crises and "entitlement reform," yet VoteSmart doesn't even
       think that entitlement reform/cuts merit any mention?  [Let's not
       forget that there have been many cuts to Medicare already.  Most
       not directing hurting the seniors' bottom line, but there should be
       a record of them, for Pete's Sake.]
       More to the point, I wonder if lawmakers object to having their
       votes on these issues tracked  and listed here.  This is very
       troublesome.

   Braley is good on a lot of issues.  But I tried to talk to him recently
   about the Social Security and Medicare cuts that are likely going to be
   offered up in the next debt/sequester/budget fight.  He sounded more
   worried about the discretionary spending cuts in the sequester.  We
   will see what he does, but I would not be surprised to see him vote for
   a "grand bargain" that includes chained CPI in order to avoid other
   cuts.

   Tom has been so clear and consistent on these issues.  I am going to
   miss him greatly.  It does not surprise me that he made the decision in
   the week that filibuster reform went down to defeat, again. He has
   championed that cause for nearly two decades, mostly to no avail.

       If Harkin is leaving because he's fed up with the Senate
       leadership, that's especially alarming.  We should be chipping away
       at fossilized rules, not running up the white flag.  And Harkin
       would only run up the white flag if there were a compelling reason
       to do so.

 Well, just saw a video of Senator Harkin on ([1235]0+ / 0-)

   C-Span's Newsmakers stating that he strongly supports filibuster
   reform.  (December 2, 2012)

   However, I doubt that he's leaving due to Reid's actions (or
   inactions).

   Here's a short video clip that I took from a segment of C-Span's
   Washington Journal.  It is a minute-plus clip of Senator Harkin talking
   about the USA Retirement Funds that he has proposed setting up through
   legislation.

   [EMBED]

     Actually, I thought it more interesting and pertinent that Senator
     Harkin is slated to receive an award on Monday, January 28, 2013
     from NCPERS naming him "Legislator Of The Year," for his proposed
     USA Retirement Funds legislation.  [NCPERS is The National
     Conference On Public Employee Systems.]

   Senator Harkin has also been lauded by The ACLI [The American Counsel
   of Life Insurers] for the following:

     As Sen. Harkin, the HELP Committee and others work to boost
     Americans' retirement security, ACLI and its members will offer
     their expertise on proposals to ensure every American has access to
     financial security and peace of mind in retirement.

   Whether its Braley or any other Iowa democrat interested in running,
   they won't be as progressive and un-abashedly liberal as Tom Harkin,
   not even close. He was still introducing minimum wage increases last
   year, he was the main senator trying to get the EFCA, he was absolutely
   disgusted by 400,000 being a measure of "middle class", he bled empathy
   and was a through and through economic populist.

   He, along with Bernie Sanders and Sherrod Brown provide a very useful
   role of being a left-block within the Dem Caucus to hold the line for
   Harry Reid when dealing with the bigger, more conservative wing of the
   caucus. Its a very good bet that the next Senator from Iowa, even a
   Democrat, will be someone who pushes Obama from the right, as opposed
   to from the left.

   I will miss him greatly. He has been one of the best Senators to serve
   during my lifetime. I could always count on Tom to stick up for
   progressive causes when the left needed him, and to be a lone voice
   trying to get the liberal agenda moved forward.

   Like others, I suspect his announcement is related to Reid's cave in.
   Harkin probably doesn't want to spend his golden years getting rebuffed
   by that old bull frog, Mitch McConnell. He's had enough and at his age
   I don't blame him for wanting to spend his remaining years doing
   something else.

   He's right, it's time for the next generation to step up to the plate,
   but his are huge shoes to fill. I hope the people of Iowa choose
   wisely.

 this is at least the sixth vulnerable Democratic ([1762]0+ / 0-)

   Senate seat in 2014; there may be others, depending on how things pan
   out, but, right now, this makes six Democratic Senate seats that are
   very vulnerable, now including two Senators retiring (Rockefeller &

   calculations, include Landrieu (LA), Begich (AK), Hagen (NC) and
   Johnson (SD).

   That compares to only one potentially vulnerable Republican seat
   (Collins-ME, depending on whether she decides to run again).

 You forgot Pryor... ([1782]0+ / 0-)

   Rockefeller retiring means W.Virginia is lost.   It's not quite
   Nebraska 2012 level of lost, but it's in between Nebraska and N.Dakota.

   Begich has a helluva uphill battle in Alaska, and only wins if Joe
   Miller is the GOP candidate.

   Johnson in South Dakota is the underdog to former GOP Gov Rounds.

   Those are three pretty sure losses.

   Then you have Pryor, Landrieu, Baucus and Hagan who could potentially
   hold on if they run a near perfect campaign.  That still might not be
   enough for Pryor given the Arkansas trending so red.  Hagan should be
   helped by the GOP take over of  NC State government and their planning
   to make Walkers Wisconsin seem tame.  Baucus will look at the Tester
   campaign, and he should have a weaker challenger than Rehberg.

   All four of those are toss-ups at best, I'd say in the area between
   toss-up and Lean R actually.

   So we're already looking at SEVEN very tough races.  And now we have to
   worry about Iowa, and this isn't even taking into account Brown in
   Massachusetts.

 Don't forget MA ([1806]0+ / 0-)

   WV is likely a goner.  SD will be a difficulty hold.  Alaska is
   probably third, but if Miller gets the nomination again, it's a good
   chance of a hold.  Pryor has a better shot of holding on than Landrieu,
   but both could make it.  If King is the nominee in Iowa, it's a likely
   hold.  NC I really don't know.  Would depend on the nominee.

   So, IF the Dems win MA, either this year or next, they're still likely
   looking at a 2-6 seat loss.  3 or 4 would be my bet right now.  I don't

 Levin ([1921]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1922]betelgeux

   I've been largely tolerant of the guy, because he's pretty reliable on
   some issues, but when it comes to foreign policy and national security,
   you never quite know where he's going to be.  I'd hardly call him a
   hawk, but on domestic security, he's not where I want him to be most of
   the time.  I've really been waiting for him to retire.

   BTW, whoever said that he is more liberal than Granholm is crazy.  She
   wasn't allowed to be anywhere as liberal as she wanted to be with the
   Michigan Senate blocking just about anything she ever wanted, and the
   so-called Democratic Speaker of the House (Andy Dillon) barely able to
   hide his contempt for her.  With friends like Bishop and Andy Dillon,
   who was supposedly in her party, she didn't need any other enemies.  In
   the Senate, I'd trust her to be a very solid liberal vote.

   That said, I don't get the feeling she ever wants to see Michigan,
   again, and I could completely understand.  The inherent sexism in most
   of the critiques of her, right and left, have been disgusting.  While
   it would have been nice to see her fight for more of what she wanted, I
   understand why she didn't given that this has got to be one of the most
   bought-and-paid for state senates in the country despite it being a
   blue state.

   Anyway, I wouldn't lose any sleep if Levin decided to retire is what
   I'm saying, and that's putting it nicely.

       retire (which I doubt he will).  If Levin was to retire, I really

       senate.  I also trust that she would be a solidly liberal vote.

       I didn't mean for it to come across that I believe she was a jobber
       as governor and would leave us in a hot minute, rather, I could
       completely understanding if she never wanted to come back given how
       she was treated.  I always knew it was going to be hard to govern a
       state whose economy was createring before the the financial crash
       of 2008; what I never quite expected was the kind of vitrial
       released against her by her opponents, and even more to the point,
       how willing Dems were to throw her under the bus and even a lot of
       veiled sexism in their critque.  Can't tell you how many Dems I
       knew that engaged in this kind of stuff and it really disappointed
       me.
       I'd vote for her for sure if she ever wanted to run for anything,
       and I think she still has enough good will with time removed from
       her term that she'd almost certainly be able to capture a Senate
       seat, but I could completely understand her if she never wanted to
       see this place again.

 Oh, I see ([1935]0+ / 0-)
       I completely agree....Granholm was treated poorly.  It was so
       disappointing to see Dems throw her under the bus during the 2010
       governors race.  Fieger (during his "I might run" period of 2010)
       was the only Dem who had the guts to stand up for Granholm and
       point out the difficult economic and political circumstances she
       faced.  There was a brief moment where I actually wanted him to be
       the nominee again.
       Granholm is definitely a strong candidate who I think could
       overcome her low approval ratings as governor.

 9 points isn't that bad ([1947]0+ / 0-)
       considering he was running against a well-liked former 4 term
       governor in 2010. Culver probably has the best name recognition,
       and plenty of experience running statewide, having run statewide 4
       times, winning 3 of those races, and coming from a famous Iowa
       political family. His brand has probably improved as well, as a lot
       of his tepid approval ratings in 2010 didn't have a whole lot to do
       with him personally. But his approval ratings were at times pretty
       bad.
       But post-election polls from PPP in 2011 showed Branstad suffering
       from the same political environment and languishing in popularity,
       with Culver doing much better in hypothetical rematches for
       Governor. It really was the environment and the gay marriage ruling
       that hit him hard. At one point in 2008, Culver had a 60% approval
       rating. It's just hard to see any specific things that really
       damaged him. He's likely the best candidate, unless he runs for
       Governor and Braley runs for Senate.
       He should be one of the top people the DGA and DSCC are recruiting
       right now, regardless.

       He's like Frank Wolf that way.  But that also means he has no
       profile statewide and would have to lay a lot of groundwork,
       there's no foundational reputation statewide to build on.
       Braley vs. Latham would be a tossup out of the gate, and ultimately
       the candidates and campaigns would decide the outcome, absent a
       national wave.
       And yes IA-03 is winnable if Latham retires, but I wouldn't call it
       "tilt D," I'd say pure tossup out of the gate...again, candidates
       and campaigns matter greatly.

 as america keeps ([2012]0+ / 0-)

   moving right and far right with another retirement of someone left of
   center that cliff we are approaching keeps getting closer and closer,
   when we reach that precipice their won't be anything left to fight for,
   the 1% will own everything but the right to fight and die for the honor
   to protect the takers, thats what givers do, its just that their
   sacrifice once was appreciated, honored and rewarded, in todays fascist
   rw america that time honored tradition is a thing of the past.

 A sad day for me ([2015]5+ / 0-)

   I was a summer intern for Harkin long ago, in 1988, when he was a
   freshman, just 4 years in.

   Great guy, great Senator.

   A big loss.

   I wish he would've run, he would've won easily.

   Sadly, I wonder if the failed filibuster reform weighed on his
   decision.  He was dedicated to it, and it's hard for me to believe he
   was pushing it hard this time just for a successor's benefit......I
   wonder if it was the last straw for him.  Sigh.

   We're in good shape to hold the seat, we simply have more and better
   candidates than the GOP.  But it will be close, and a bad candidate or
   bad campaign or an anti-Democratic national backlash can be enough to
   cost us the seat.  At least the third of those things is highly
   unlikely given the GOP House.

 Is the Dem bench ([2023]0+ / 0-)
       in Iowa really that much stronger than the GOP's?

 No it is not ([2027]0+ / 0-)
       The Democratic bench get very weakened in Iowa without T Harkin. I
       would tell it is the weakest of all the 23 bluest states (until
       Colorado). And this including T Vilsack, who is not in a statewide
       position.
       Still it is a blue state and every race is winnable.

 Remember North Dakota in the last cycle.. ([2031]3+ / 0-)

   North Dakota was the most likliest to switch parties after the
   retirement of Kent Conrad, and Heidi Heitkamp pulled off a win, and in
   a presidential election year, no less.  In a smaller state like Iowa,
   (small population wise), we have an excellent shot.  I also don't think
   we should be writing off West Virginia yet.  There are a lot of tough
   votes coming  up, and West Virginia likes their pork and social
   services.  Shelly Moore Capito will be making lots of votes cutting
   money off to her state, this could be interesting.
