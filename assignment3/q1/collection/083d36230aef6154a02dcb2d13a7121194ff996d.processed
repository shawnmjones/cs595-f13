[71]Valerie Harper's cancer 'pretty close' to remission

   Valerie Harper's cancer diagnosis has taken a turn for the better.

   The actress [72]revealed in March that she was battling a rare,
   terminal form of cancer that doctors believed left her with just three
   to six months to live.

   But in late August, the 74-year-old actress [73]said on "Today" that
   she's getting "pretty close to remission."

   Since her diagnosis, Harper has been undergoing chemotherapy in
   addition to Eastern treatments like acupuncture.

   "Spontaneous remission lives as a possibility," the sitcom star said on
   "Today." "A lot of stuff that looks impossible is not, and every day
   there's evidence of it."

   In June, Harper received more of that evidence. Although her illness is
   incurable, doctors had good news when Harper went in for an MRI test:
   her scans showed that she was improving.

   "We're getting pretty close to a remission," Harper's doctor said,
   admitting that he didn't expect for Harper to have survived as long as
   she has. "It defies the odds."

   Visit NBCNews.com for [74]breaking news, [75]world news, and [76]news
   about the economy

   Harper still has to stay on top of her treatment, as her doctor noted
   that it isn't a matter of if the cancer becomes resistant, but when.
   Yet for now, the actress is reveling in the impossible becoming
   possible.

   For more on Harper's journey, look out for NBC's hour-long documentary
   on the star's fight with cancer that's scheduled to air on September 19
   at 10 p.m.

       Valerie has become my personal role model in how to live your life
       after getting a bad cancer diagnosis. I too have Non Small Lung
       Cancer, stage IV. I was diagnosed , the 2nd time, on Dec. 2010.She
       is living her life to the fullest, as long as she is able, and that
       is what I am doing as well. Chemo is no picnic, but giving up what
       you love, be it acting as in Valerie's case, or an antique dealer,
       in my case is letting this disease "win".
       She is truly an inspiration to anyone who is battling this disease.

       Doctors can only guess at a prognosis. I have a friend who had
       prostate cancer that spread from head to toe. He was given 3 months
       to live. 11 years and 23 cruises later, he finally passed away.
       Again, don't rely on a grim prognosis from a doctor as the final
       word.

       I think Valerie Harper is a wonderful and courageous woman.
       HOWEVER...
       This story is an utter fake. Worse, they're preying on her
       desperate hopes in quoting her that the cancer is "almost in
       remission."
       Notice that they didn't say what kind of cancer? Another network
       story said it is lung cancer and that it has spread to her brain,
       which is a very normal path Stage IV for lung cancer.
       Here is what is false:
       1. "The doctors gave her three to six months to live." THAT DID NOT
       HAPPEN. My wife was treated by the same lung cancer specialist she
       went to, Ronald Natale at Cedars. I know what Natale would say,
       because I heard him say it: that the MEDIAN SURVIVAL RATE for such
       a cancer is "X" months. A responsible doctor, and especially an
       oncologist,. NEVER NEVER NEVER says "you have x months to live"
       because they have NO IDEA. They know the MEDIAN - half live
       longer,half die sooner. The median survival rate for my wife's
       Stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer was six months at her
       diagnosis. She outlived it by three years because she got fantastic
       treatment (before Blue Cross turned into such a pack of thieves).
       2. 'REMISSION." The NORMAL course of events, the FIRST TIME one is
       treated with chemo, is for the cancer markers in the bloodstream to
       nearly disappear. That is what happens to MOST patients who receive
       the right chemo for the illness. Then, the small remaining cancer,
       which has beaten that chemo, comes back. Then they typically get a
       different chemo combination, and that works for a while. Then, it
       comes back again. Most lung cancers are relentless and not
       defeatable past Stage II.
       I feel terribly sorry for her that she has go to through this, but
       also because she is publicly setting herself up as being in a
       special situation when what she is experiencing is the normal
       course of the disease and treatment. Good for her for fighting it,
       but there is only one way that this will end. Sad to say, I watched
       it happen day by day for three and a half years.
       3. "Eastern treatments." If you believe that hogwash, by all means,
       get Eastern treatments or whatever else you can get that boosts
       morale and doesn't do harm IN ADDITION TO the treatments
       oncologists recommend. But what extends life most is (a) the best
       combination of chemo, IMRT and stereotactic radiosurgery (for the
       metastatic brain tumors), excellent nutrition, and marijuana for
       the chemo and radiation nausea. I don't advocate medical marijuana
       for much, but it is fantastic for dealing with chemo and radiation
       nausea. She should not smoke it. She should get an inhaler that
       heat-blows the THC out of the weed into water, and then inhale
       above the water. They're available online for about $400.

       When Valerie was on the "Doctors" a few months ago, I actually
       questioned just how good her doctors really were. While they were
       delivering this dire, hopeless prognosis, one of them said in an
       off-handed way, something like the path the cancer was taking in
       Valerie was unlike any they'd seen before. I was incredulous that
       none of the doctors on the panel even questioned it. My immediate
       questions were "Could they have the wrong diagnosis?", "How could
       they possibly accurately predict the outcome and strip her of all
       hope if they hadn't seen the cancer react like this before?". I so
       hope they were wrong and she's going to beat this and live a long
       and happy life. She's one amazing lady.

            Doctors do not have crystal balls - they never know for sure
            how long a person has. They are usually very accurate, but the
            biology of the human body is still a mystery. If they said
            they thought she had three to six months, then they were
            probably convinced that the progression was unstoppable. Do
            not take their estimation error here to indicate that they are
            wrong in general, or that they misdiagnosed her.
            A friend of a friend got lung cancer this summer - he was 31.
            It snuck up on him, and they gave him three months at most. He
            died within three weeks.

            Heavy exercise is not generally a bad thing to do if you have
            cancer, unless the treatments leave you weak. Plus, she might
            as well do it now. Even if she beats the cancer and lives
            thirty more years, she will never be in as good a shape as she
            is now... so she should dance now if she ever wants to do it.

            Don't think God has a scoreboard of points for each of us. The
            Bible says He loves us regardless of what we have done. It
            also says the prayer of a righteous (believing) person is
            powerful and effective. Your prayers for Valerie, or anyone
            else, including yourself, will be heard and is never a waste
            of time. I used to be a nonbeliever, but I took a leap of
            faith and am so glad I did.

       For some reason when dealing with patients most doctors always
       start with the worst case scenario. I suppose anything that happens
       on the plus side of these kinds of diagnoses can only make them
       look good. I'd take everything they say with a very large grain of

            Hi Kathleen..
            It is indeed inspiring to hear that you are a survivor. I
            presume you have Glioblastoma Multiforme. Our Mother had it
            and died less than a year from her diagnosis and since her
            passing , I have learned of cases of survivors, yours being by
            far one of the longest I have heard of. That is truly
            wonderful. I really wish our Mother had been one of the
            survivors and presume the Lord wanted her home. I certainly
            think Valerie Harper's news is wonderful and is a far cry from
            her prognosis a few months ago. This is wonderful news for her
            , as is yours and the other survivors. Thank God !
