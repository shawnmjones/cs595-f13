   U.S. Representative Steve King (R-IA) talks at the 38th annual
   Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) meeting at the Marriott
   Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, February 10, 2011. REUTERS/Larry
   Downing
   Dear Mr. King, when I [30]previously suggested you should perhaps just
   stop talking for a few days, thus allowing America a brief respite from
   your deep thoughts on what sort of things are and are not racist, I
   should have clarified that I also meant the Twitters. [31]My apologies.
   [32][d23ccc7ac888a338fbe4a2abdb52b495_normal.jpeg] Mr. President:
   Invite the rodeo clown 2 the White House 4 a beer summit. Take the
   temperature down, have a laugh, relax. It's not about race
   -- [33]@SteveKingIA
   Helpful tip: Iowa Rep. Steve King is [34]among the last people you
   would want to talk to when trying to decide whether or not a given
   thing [35]is about race. Also: Dixie Chicks. Also too: Obama has to
   meet with clowns on a regular basis already, I'm fairly sure we don't
   need to be adding any more to the mix. Also also too: No, seriously.
   Please stop talking about what you think is and isn't racist. Even your
   fellow Republican diehards [36]are sick of hearing from you.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [52]Tagging tips - [53]Search For Tags - [54]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   I read today that the rodeo clown has 60,000 likes on his facebook
   acccount now and likely will cash in on his racism.

   The racists in America have come completely out in the open with the
   re-election of Barack Obama.

   Say what you will about policy, his election and re-election struck an
   important blow for a more decent America.  The ripples are still out
   there.

     his election and re-election struck an important blow for a more
     decent America
       in re: open racism. Does this expose it to sunlight to disinfect or
       does it "legitimize" otherwise suppressed racism to blossom?
       I'd like to think that this is the last spasm of Klanism, that
       going so public will inoculate future generations, but what if it
       doesn't? What if it encourages people who would otherwise keep
       their hate to themselves to instead, that it would die with them,
       instead, spread their hate to their circle of acquaintances?

       Electing Barack Obama was very important for black pride and for
       others who see a rainbow future.  It was an important blow because
       it caused blowback like this.  The racists can never remove his
       photo from the Hall of Presidents.  His presidency puts a lie to
       white supremacy and its necessary corrallary of black inferiority,
       every day.
       The rainbow is decency; white racism is evil.

       And his election is a major milestone in the march to full equality
       (not the finishline, but a major marker nonetheless).
       I'm under no illusion that we are in a "post-racial" environment
       and if anyone out there still believes that, they aren't keeping
       track.
       I just wonder if the openness of the racist hatred is helping or

   The election of a black guy to the presidency struck a blow for a more
   decent America, and due the backlash it also brought a level of racism
   out into the open that we wouldn't have seen with a white president.

   It could be something that was cooked up in a meeting and passed

   Either that (and I suppose this is very likely) King heard Noonan say
   it and is such an idiot that he decided to use it as well.

   Actually, now that I think of it, that's more likely.

       HOrrors horrors!!!!!

     Now that the White House has weighed in on the incident via an
     official spokesperson, and their response was to lament on how the
     incident reflects negatively on the state of Missouri, the only
     conclusion we are left to draw is that this White House condones the
     absurdly defensive overreaction. This is what anyone who dares mock
     the president is due.

     This is a disturbing and, frankly, terrifying development. Any
     classical liberal should be offended at the prospect that a
     presidential administration would use its considerable leverage to
     justify the suppression of the right of average citizens to freely
     mock and deride the political class without the fear of reprisal.
     Indeed, lampooning and creating caricatures of political figures is
     a foundational American value. To attack that value is to attack
     what it means to be a citizen of the republic.

   ... is amazing. They are going to accuse him of being polarizing if he
   says nothing or if he says something. Content is irrelevant.

   And what he actually says?  Measured, thoughtful, careful, nuanced.
   It's been an eye opener for me - I'm in Chicago and knew Pres Obama
   when he was a state legislator.  He was never even remotely racially
   polarizing, which is why I thought he would win, and which is why I
   thought we'd be a lot farther along right now. This was not much of an
   issue when he ran for and served as senator, at least in Illinois.

   It makes me understand better a couple things:  First, propaganda
   really works. They create a narrative, and idiots buy into it.  Second,
   racism is a whole lot deeper and uglier on a national level. I was
   naive.

   Maybe in the end, that is a benefit.  Things are in the open and
   reasonable people can see it for what it is.

       The beer summit was a masterful piece of politics. It successfully
       defused a very rancorous situation. President Obama pwned his
       critics with that event. They didn't see it coming and they didn't
       realize what had hit them until it was all over.

   That Obama actually WORKS at his job. He doesn't just appear on Sunday

   Obama doesn't have time to hang out with a racist rodeo clown (well,
   speaking of racist rodeo clowns, it might be useful for him to meet

   the little amount of work the House gets done, that they assume the
