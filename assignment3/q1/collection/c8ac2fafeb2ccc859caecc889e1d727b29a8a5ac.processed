   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [40]Tagging tips - [41]Search For Tags - [42]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [43]Civil
   Rights, [44]Community, [45]Congress, [46]Culture, [47]Economy,
   [48]Education, [49]Elections, [50]Energy, [51]Environment, [52]Health
   Care, [53]International, [54]Labor, [55]Law, [56]Media, [57]Meta,
   [58]National Security, [59]Science, [60]Transportation, or [61]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([62]California, [63]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 The ABC report does the exact opposite. ([109]0+ / 0-)
       It details the exchange of memos between the White House and the
       State Dept and shows that they didn't substantively change the
       original content of their initial press release. And no one
       "redacted" anything, it was a reasoned back and forth about what
       exactly to say and how to say it.
       But right-wingers aren't going to let facts stop them from spending
       another year or two trying to claim this is some kind of
       controversy, cover-up, whatever. Fucking hypocritical scumbags.

   Even excellent, but Nixon did not order the break-in at the DNC
   headquarters. He was told about it soon afterwards by his Chief of
   Staff, H.R. Haldeman, and he took control of the cover-up right away,
   and taped the whole thing for the next two years, like a ninny.  But
   there's never been any evidence Nixon knew about the break-in in
   advance, let alone ordered it, not that it made much difference in the
   end.

   George F. Will feels bad about Watergate. He said Monica was worse than
   Watergate. He is always mentioning it. The GOP hasn't gotten over it
   yet.  You who are too young to remember the profound pleasure of
   reading the daily papers back then--well, all I can say is, it was

 There's a cancer on the Congress this time ([244]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [245]SherwoodB

   Our long national nightmare has metastasized. Nixon told his top aids
   early on that no one will care about Watergate "...it's routine,
   everyone is bugging everyone else, it's politics". Well breaking into
   the political opposition's headquarters to gain unfair advantage in a
   national election is not just politics. It's arguably a coup and
   definitely a crime. Making people sign a pledge to an anti-tax blind
   totality or face political abandonment if not career sabotage using
   partisan media against its own is not just politics. It's arguably
   extortion and definitely a filter through which only those of lesser
   scruples can pass.

   This has passed for politics too long--Reagan, Bush and Bush had no
   incentive to stop it, Clinton had his hands full staying afloat and may
   have missed it because partisan media is not what it is today yet. But
   President Obama is being defeated by it. It's now that this cancer must
   be stopped. The fact that Mitt Romney lent his name to this conflict of
   loyalty means that with a different outcome of the last election we
   could be one nation under Norquist with lip service and "just us" for
   all.

   Watergate and Iran Contra were both Republican scandals. Would make
   more sense if the GOP could claim that Benghazi was worse than some
   Democratic scandal.

   If they could ever find a real one.

 Democrats will never learn ([258]0+ / 0-)

   Democrats need to counter this to illustrate to the public how low on
   controversies this sloppy messaging by the State Department wa. Just
   coompare this with the much more serios lies and misrepresnations made
   during cheneys time and why the Republicans never held hearings on
   those. Other than the torture hearings, did they go after Chene for
   cherrypicking and manipulating the intelligence?

 And not a single republican can manage ([265]0+ / 0-)

   to explain EXACTLY what they think is being covered up.

   Just a lot of jumping up and down about a cover up.

   Usually, such a thing means the administration went to great lengths to
   hold back the truth of the matter instead of juggling it for a few days
   while they were trying to find out themselves.

   If Obama and Clinton were still claiming it wasn't a terrorist attack
   right up until election day.. the right might be on to something.
