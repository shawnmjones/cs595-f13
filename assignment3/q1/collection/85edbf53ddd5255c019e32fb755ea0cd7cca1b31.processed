   If only the people of Syria had the attention-getting device of the
   British "[31]Royal Easel," made famous with last week's announcement of
   the royal baby, lucky little George Alexander.  The birth of a single
   baby got wall-to-wall cable news coverage for a week or more, while
   93,000 Syrians dying in a brutal civil war were noted in passing by the
   attention-deficient cable news hounds.

   Sure, what's going on in Syria is [32]confusing and [33]scary and tends
   to make our eyes glaze over, but what's happening now matters because
   it will eventually have an [34]impact on all of us.  (See Afghanistan,
   Somalia, Pakistan, etc.)

   But, hey, I'm not a doom-and-gloom, depressed cartoonist.  There are
   some genuinely absurd and funny (in a depressing-lite sort of way)
   things about this terrible civil war.  Assad has succeeded in bringing
   Israel and Islamic jihadists together, joined together in attacking the
   Syrian regime with various explosive devices.  My enemy's enemy is my .
   . . er, never mind.

   And remember, one of the best ([35]or only) things you can do to help
   the people of Syria is to [36]donate to the relief efforts that help
   refugees.

   Hey, what did you expect, Weiner jokes?  (Maybe next week.)  Be sure to
   share far and wide, comment, like and do all that other good stuff that
   will help the NSA build a good profile of you!

   News!  In-a-nutshell!

   In the news today is . . . royal easels?

   With last week's successful baby announcement using the Royal Easel,
   the news spread like wildfire!

   Which led a certain former French colony to borrow the royal publicity
   tactic, in the hopes of drawing attention to their plight!

   At first, they started with a simple announcement.

   They soon realized, and hoped, that additional details on the Royal
   Easel would bring more attention.

   And maybe, if presented on the Royal Easel, news of the growing refugee
   crisis would quickly spread.

   But perhaps growth comparisons would be more effective!

   Yes, maybe percentages displayed on the Royal Easel will bring more
   coverage!

   Or maybe more must be explained about birthing a civil war . . .

   . . . and the growing complications therein, where Iran and Hezbollah
   fight for Assad while Israel is on the same side as jihadists.

   Or maybe an announcement of multiple births on the Royal Easel will
   have the effect of . . . complicating things.

   Meanwhile, a grand proclamation of United States military support is
   sure to . . . never mind.

   So, as ten percent of Lebanon's population suddenly becomes Syrian
   refugees and fighting spreads across the border . . . and with no
   political or military solution in sight-- it's time to say . . .

   Good night, and give some bucks.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [69]Civil
   Rights, [70]Community, [71]Congress, [72]Culture, [73]Economy,
   [74]Education, [75]Elections, [76]Energy, [77]Environment, [78]Health
   Care, [79]International, [80]Labor, [81]Law, [82]Media, [83]Meta,
   [84]National Security, [85]Science, [86]Transportation, or [87]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([88]California, [89]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       That Bush stated he wanted to create in the middle east. Now, it
       might be too far gone. The Syrian people were very secular, but now
       it appears to be mainly a secessionist war.
       Not sure what to do really. If Assad continues to murder children I
       do not know how NATO can stand by. Plus, Putin is outright arming
       the regime. This has the possibility of developing into a major
       conflict with the state of Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.
       Bush and Cheney said they invaded Iraq to make us "safer". The
       reality is they created hell on earth in the Middle East and
       strengthened Iran. That is Bushes legacy.. Our Brave American and
       Allied soldiers died  and Civilian lives were destroyed in vain.
       I love our troops and always will no matter the conflict.

 Wasn't this more an outshoot of the (much ([110]0+ / 0-)

       They protested peacefully and when attacked took up arms
       (rightfully so). They wanted US intervention, but it is difficult
       to do with us being so tapped out. Bush's destabilization has
       created a haven for extremism in Iraq (how ironic) and those
       radicals (both Shia and Sunni) are trying to turn it into a
       sectarian conflict.
       Its the Irish Troubles on steroids basically. I do think NATO
       intervention can marginalize the Jihadist though.
       The major problem is Assad has jets and tanks, the rebels do not.
       The rebels must be very brave to continue to stand up against such
       superior firepower.
       Putin's flagrant selling of arms (including anti aircraft missiles)
       is a massive offense. Do not get me wrong, the US sells tons of
       arms, but Russia and China are preventing an arms embargo in the UN
       right now.

 So we should bomb Russia? ([118]0+ / 0-)
       Good idea!  No, you didn't say it outright, but every single

       If Russia is going to use Syria to fight a proxy war then we should
       respond. Nowhere did I say "bomb Russia". Thanks for putting words

   Does it involve US?
   Is it any of our business?
   Is there any way we can help the non-combatants? (I mean as a nation
   rather than as individuals via NGOs)?
   Or are we better off staying out of it for all concerned?
   Rwanda or Bosnia? Or Iraq?

 Yes, we ought to stay out, completely ([139]0+ / 0-)
       (of course, that is damn difficult to do after the fact, so it's
       quite the quandry).
       But arguments can be made that even well meaning efforts, like
       providing humanitarian aid for the victims, are not helpful.  For
       example, the following article argues this point: [140]Alms

 Why stay out and let Iran, Russia exploit ([144]0+ / 0-)
       The conflict?
       Again, this is developing into a regional thing. Like it or not,
       our economy is still dependent on oil. The longer we allow this to
       go on, the worse it will get.
       We should establish a no-fly zone at the very least (my god I am
       agreeing with McCain). It must be a NATO lead intervention though,
       the US should not do it alone.
       It is looking like over the next few decades it is going to be the
       US/UK/France vs Russia/China/Iran. A possibility of a major
       conflict exists right now.
       I am far from a Hawk, but there is such a thing as justified
       intervention. The Syrians were begging for us to help. We didn't,
       so they turned to other sources.
       However, the radicals are still the minority.

 The bottom line seems to be is that if we ([148]0+ / 0-)
       get involved it will almost certainly be either directly through
       "the radicals" or it will at least be to their benefit.
       Essentially, it will be reproducing Afghanistan 30 years later.  I
       mean, do we ever learn anything from the past?  It seems not!!

 Very different situation ([152]0+ / 0-)
       Afghani's viewed our invasion as a Koranic Jihad, Syrian moderates
       are begging for our help. The two cultures are so different you
       cannot even compare them.
       I know its scary to think about another war, and its even easier to
       put them in blanket generalizations but this is a much more
       justifiable one.
       "The Radicals" would not even be in Syria now had we acted quicker
       (and that might have prevented us from having to become directly
       involved).
       Anyways, this conflict is not going away, its not something we can
       just ignore. Afghanistan was not ignorable either, we just had an
       idiot at the helm who handled things terrible (example: Treating Al
       Qaeda and Taliban as a single entity)

 Innoncent children are being murdered ([156]0+ / 0-)

   Majority of the population wants Assad out. I do not think it is just
   our problem, its the Western Worlds problem. The major problem is it is
   at a position of a stalemate. Russian arms are allowing this to happen.
   Putin/Russia become more of an enemy every day.

   Assad has used Sarin gas, China, Russia and Iran are aligned with
   Assad. Hezbollah and Iranian soldier have been found in Syria.

   To be honest, the best and most hopeful solution would be to go over
   and support the FSA the best we can. Hopefully we marginalize the
   radicals.

   It would have been best to get involved almost immediately, the
   Jihadist are relatively recent. They pulled the same thing in Mali and
   it eventually required French intervention (with UK and US support).

   Its not going away. I am not saying I have the answers, but this is not
   just Syria. Several countries are engaged in this conflict (it has
   already extended to Lebanon and Iraq).

 I have no idea what the right answer is. ([164]0+ / 0-)

   I sat on a sofa in 1994, my knees pulled to my chest and I sobbed as I
   watched bodies float down a bloody  river and be stacked like firewood.
   I remember who I was with. A physician used to saving lives but not
   unfamiliar with death, his arm was wrapped tightly around me, and he
   was ghastly white. I even remember the  jeans I was wearing because my
   hands were trembling and I spilled a drink all over myself when the
   news cut away.

   It seemed so clear to me: we HAD to go and do something.

   But in the 20 years since, I've learned that our presence often makes
   things worse. Violent people use US as a reason to hurt each other. And
   our fellow and sister citizens are harmed and die not only on the
   battlefield but due to neglect here at home because war takes every
   penny that is needed (plus many more) and provides a useful distraction
   and justification for those who prefer to abandon the poor, the
   mentally ill, the aged, the disabled, and every other vulnerable
   citizen.

   Then our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines come home and too many
   are those vulnerable citizens that have been abandoned.

   So in 1984, I would have shouted, yes! We must go in.
   Today, I simply don't know.

   issue that I personally have no answer for, however, I cannot
   understand why an American citizenry from a supposed democratic nation
   has so much interest in the birth of a child of a Monarchy. The birth
   of any child is a joyful occasion, but to make such a big deal over the
   birth of a future King, I find more than ridiculous. Are they using the
   popular vote now to elect Kings? Just. Don't. Get. It.

 Americans just see the royal family as celebrities ([184]0+ / 0-)
       Like the Kardassians. They influence our lives exactly as much.
       They rub elbows with the rich and famous. At least they do a bit of
       charitable work, and Harry and William sort of were/are in the
       military.
       I think a lot of people here take the monarchy thing much too
       seriously. It's not our concern if Brits want to support the
       royals. We pay the Bachmanns for all sorts of questionable stuff.
       I'm guessing that Brits who pay attention think THAT is very
       grotesque as well.
       The Windsors don't have the authority of most monarchs.
       So they're entertaining. And Kate and William seem to be reasonably
       nice compared to the rest of em (and compared to many of our
       celebrities).
       Meh, I don't see a problem.

   we need to stay the fuck out of this one! The LAST thing we need is
   another war, particularly with a country that has NOT attacked us.
   Let's not forget that Russia & China & Iran are also involved. Sorry.
   Syria is not worth starting WW3. If oil's the thing, use the savings
   from staying out of THIS one (as well as getting out of Iraq &
   Afghanistan) and put it towards renewables.

       Syria produces about half as much as North Dakota for context.
       The world can probably make do w/o it.

 "not worth starting WW3" ([201]0+ / 0-)
       I didn't realize that the majority of combatants in the last two
       wars had a choice.
       Yes, Russia, China, Iran are involved, hence the reason it cannot
       be ignored.
       Oh not to mention, they are human beings facing a genocidal
       action...
       Oil plays into it, but there are large humanitarian concerns. We
       can be a force for good, and for a long time we were. Why let an
       idiots fucked up invasion of Iraq deter us from actually helping
       people?

   difficult to determine a clear-cut smart strategy  on Syria for the
   US..

   A no-fly zone is very expensive- 1 billion/month.
   Will a month be long enough? Doubtful.

   Russia is spoiling for a fight with the US of late.
   Putin is enjoying holding the Snowden asylum over our heads.

   I say, stand clear, with the usual under the radar special forces
   helping train and guide the ''good'' rebels.

       Of course, I was washing my hair in March 2003. Someone yanked me
       out of the shower and dragged me there anyhow.
       I'm still trying to rinse that trillion-dollar deficit out of my
       hair. Ick.

 "1,200 different factions and militias" ([221]0+ / 0-)

   All of this is very sad, but the fact that there are 1,200 different
   factions and militias involved in this "civil" war is sufficient by
   itself to explain why no one is rushing in with military aid.
