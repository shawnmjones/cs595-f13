   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Matternet and Aria are exploring the possibility of dense drone
       networks that could deliver goods to remote areas
     * The idea is to connect regions or towns where roads are unreliable
       or do not reach
     * Preliminary vehicle tests have already taken place in Haiti and the
       Dominican Republic

   (CNN) -- Going off-road used to mean tearing up dirt tracks in a
   powerful four-by-four or gigantic monster truck.

   For two ambitious tech start-ups however, the term has come to comprise
   something more subtle and potentially revolutionary.

   For the past 18 months [43]Matternet and [44]A[45]ria -- separate
   companies born out of the the same Silicon Valley incubator -- have
   been working towards creating a roving network of automated drones that
   will help connect rural and under-developed areas with little access to
   existing road or highway systems.

   While the idea may sound far-fetched to those unfamiliar with the
   latest in civilian drone technology, preliminary vehicle testing has
   already taken place.

   "The easiest way to describe what we are doing is to compare how mobile
   telephony has taken off in the developing world," said Matternet
   founder and CEO, Andreas Raptopoulos.

   "(We want) to leapfrog the traditional modes of transportation
   infrastructure in a similar way and bring items through these unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs) to people who may otherwise be cut off or
   isolated," he added.
   The easiest way to describe what we are doing is to compare how mobile
   telephony has taken-off in the developing world
   Andreas Raptopolous, Matternet

   A network of drones

   The idea stems from when Raptopoulos led a research group including the
   company's three other co-founders at the [47]Singularity University in
   Silicon Valley.

   They envisioned employing a fleet of drones with a two kilogram payload
   capacity and a six mile flight-range.

   These automated vehicles would be complemented on the ground by a vast
   network of strategically positioned hubs, enabling drones to recharge
   their batteries every few miles before continuing to the next station
   (where the recharging process is repeated) or final destination.

   Control of the drones and the assignment of packages for delivery would
   eventually be handled by an automated operating system. Orders or
   requests could then be placed and paid for by cell phone.

   The potential applications, Raptopoulos explained, include delivery of
   medicines to disconnected areas, enabling farmers to supply products
   directly to customers and providing vital materials to areas cut off by
   natural disasters.

   In the future, he adds, the concept could also be adapted to enhance
   the transport or distribution systems of large cities.

   So far, Matternet have reached the stage of conducting initial trials
   of "quadrocopter" drones, which took place in Haiti and the Dominican
   Republic last year.

   While happy with the results, Raptopolous believes the concept needs
   more testing before commercial or civilian deployment can be
   considered.
   On the analogue internet you are still sending packages but these are
   physical
   Arturo Pelayo, Aria

   Internet of actual things

   Meanwhile [49]Aria (Autonomous Roadless Intelligent Array) -- set up by
   students from the same Singularity University class but concentrating
   more on developing an open source system and ground network -- intends
   to develop an autonomous aerial system to service this year's Burning
   Man festival in Nevada.

   According to Aria co-founder, Arturo Pelayo, a hyper-connected UAV
   network creates the possibility of a physical delivery system so dense
   and interconnected that is in effect an "analogue internet."

   "On the internet you send digital packages. On the analogue internet
   you are still sending packages but these are physical," he said.

   "We see the opportunity to create these very flexible networks serviced
   by these systems and ground hubs (which could even be something as
   basic as a disused shipping container) over very large areas," he
   added.

   As the technology develops further, Pelayo believes they will overcome
   the drones' principle limitations -- namely the short distances they
   can travel and small weight they are able to carry.

   He also highlights cost benefits as a significant factor in making the
   technology attractive to potential users.

   Counting the cost

   Raptopolous agrees and points to a case study carried out at the
   Singularity University of the Maseru district in the tiny African
   kingdom of Lesotho, which put the price of a network of 50
   base-stations and 150 drones at just $900,000 -- comparing favorably
   against $1 million for a two kilometer, one-lane road.
   The idea of Matternet is not to replace systems where they work well
   but really to compliment them
   Andreas Raptopolous, Matternet

   But while enthusiastic about these figures Raptopolous emphasizes that
   he doesn't see drones replacing roads or highways any time soon.

   Roads, after all, still carry the obvious benefit of being able to
   transport people and cater for much larger and heavier loads.

   "The idea of Matternet is not to replace systems where they work well
   but really to complement them," he said.

   External factors such as how small drones perform in bad weather, how
   they interact with other aircraft as well as public perceptions of
   devices best known for their operation in a military theater will also
   have to be overcome, he admits.

   On top of this, the fact that drones could be adapted to transport
   illicit materials such as drugs is also something that must be
   considered.

   This is a point addressed by associate professor of aviation at the
   University of North Dakota, Ben Trapnell.

   However, he noted that while such networks could theoretically be
   abused in such a way it would be foolish to disregard the "host of
   societal and economic benefits" they could provide.
