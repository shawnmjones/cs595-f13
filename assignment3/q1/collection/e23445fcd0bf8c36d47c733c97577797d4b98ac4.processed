[24]Heritage's in-house white supremacist wrote for white supremacists

   Jason Richwine, senior policy analyst at Heritage Foundation
   Jason Richwine, senior white supremacist at Heritage Foundation
   In case there was [30]any doubt that Heritage Foundation's Jason
   Richwine is a white supremacist, there's his pieces for a white
   supremacist website:

     Richwine's two stories for Spencer's website, AlternativeRight.com,
     dealt with crime rates among Hispanics in the United States.
     AlternativeRight.com describes itself as "dedicated to heretical
     perspectives on society and culture--popular, high, and
     otherwise--particularly those informed by radical, traditionalist,
     and nationalist outlooks."

   That site is run by Richard Spencer, who also runs a "think tank" for
   "White Americans". Nice friends, Richwine has.

     Richwine's articles for AlternativeRight.com, "Model Minority?,"
     published on March 3, 2010, and "More on Hispanics and Crime,"
     published the next day, push back on an American Conservative essay
     that argued that some conservatives have over-hyped the crime rate
     among Hispanics. (Richwine's article was cross-posted on the website
     of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in
     Washington where Richwine was previously a fellow.)

     "A proper analysis of the data indicates that Hispanics have a
     substantially higher crime rate than whites," Richwine wrote in the
     first piece, which he backed up with federal prison data showing the
     incarceration rates of whites and Hispanics.

   Ah yes, because incarceration rates have nothing to do with [31]race
   and class, proving that this self-styled Poindexter is really quite the
   moron.

   Meanwhile, the Heritage Foundation is considering [32]hiring a crisis
   management firm to repair its image, because what did they think would
   happen by putting Jim DeMint in charge?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Only a problem to the extent it prevents further mainlining of sweet
   wingnut and/or corporate ca$h.

   Stuff like this may incent the former, and discourage overt inflows of
   the latter.  At the end of the day, it's not a matter of decency for
   the Foundation, but rather just a matter of the bottom line.

       and wrote a dissertation with many of these questionable assertions
       -- I couldn't believe that no one on the faculty called him on that
       stuff.
       When I was in grad school at Hopkins and wrote my dissertation on
       women, work and family responsibilities, my advisor -- who was just
       as lefty as I was -- stopped me from putting in any of my personal
       views. She read my draft of the introduction, said she knew it was
       heartfelt, and now that I had expressed it, I had to cut it from
       the introduction and write solely based on a review of the
       literature, research and data. Which I did.
       I was also required, as are all good researchers, to point out the
       weaknesses in my data and findings.
       So who was this guy's advisor and which faculty were on his
       committee?

       I'm at a refugee conference in Florida today, hanging out with a
       whole mess of Cubans.  A lot of them, especially the younger ones,
       get it.  But some of these older conservative Cubans are really a
       mess, in terms of any sort of consistency or logic.  They sure
       don't much care for their poorer, darker brothers from Mexico and
       Central America, do they?
       I don't really have a problem with rather lax immigration rules for
       Cubans, and I can't help but like Cubans generally despite
       disliking their politics so much. But they have a special deal, and
       it's not exactly fair to everyone else. Makes it especially sad
       when they want to restrict entry for others.  And my God, if there
       was any population from some benighted island in the Caribbean that
       needs a break, it's the Haitians!  Just compare how the US treats
       Cubans compared to Haitians!  I oppose guest worker programs that
       don't lead to citizenship, but I could see making an exception to
       allow more Haitians to earn money in the US and repatriate it...
       there's no way that island survives without remitted income.

       pro-US-Republicans, pro-White, openly racist, misogynistic,
       homophobic, hateful and cruel person I've ever met.
       You'd think that any of those qualifiers would help him to
       empathize with other people, but no, it seems his anger towards
       others is only enhanced. He's not the least shy about expressing

       I've never really met anyone like him in my entire life (lots of
       years). I don't know how someone could get to be his age and still

       [603]the Dunning-Kruger effect of [604]illusory superiority.
       Charles Darwin expressed this colloquially as "Ignorance more

       time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with
       any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and
       indecision."
       Regarding that last one of Russell, the beginning phrase could
       apply to the whole Republican Party, and the ending phrase to the
       Democrats (with some exceptions, like Elizabeth Warren). Our ideas
       are the better ones, but can't be heard over all that loud
       stupid-based certainty from the other side. That is, until this
       loud stupid-based certainty becomes even too much for the
       less-than-totally stupid to bear (as the Richwine case is becoming
       given the Republican pushback).

 There are two huge problems with IQ testing ([750]8+ / 0-)

   First, the concept of a single composite number for intelligence is
   troubling, since it's not entirely clear that intelligence is definable
   as a single entity.  This reification of intelligence is cultural...
   what, precisely and specifically, is meant by intelligence?  And how do
   you measure it with a single number?  This is my biggest complaint..
   I'm not convinced it measures something useful.  There may be ways of
   measuring abstract reasoning (partially culturally determined),
   linguistic skills (culturally determined) and mathematical ability
   (quite possibly the only form of intelligence that may be more genetic
   than not).  But you can't lump everything together and call it
   "intelligence".

   Second, IQ testing is always rooted in culture, even if the
   psychologists designing IQ tests think it is not.

   There's such a long and grim history of racism and fraud and sloppy
   methodology in IQ testing that the whole thing should give anyone
   pause.  Read "The Mis-Measure of Man" by Steven Jay Gould, published in
   the early 80's, for a detailed critique and expose of that whole sordid
   history. It was a formative book for me as a college student, learning
   and leaving behind my politically conservative upbringing.  I feel as
   if I know this shitheel who wrote this report already, having read
   about similar efforts to use IQ to define racial difference in the
   1880s, 1920's and 1940's.

       Western European culture a the basis.
       Then test other cultures, races, etc, and compare the results.
       That's just invalid on its face.
       Whoever came up with IQ, I've always been convinced, was just a
       sadly mistaken person (if not a fraud and fool).
       "IQ:" one number for all facets of knowledge and intelligence and
       cultural reference and ability.   Isn't that very concept a fraud?
       I know wonderful people who I went to HS with who were labeled with
       "low IQ" because they had a bad day during the test or because
       their wonderfulness was apparent in ways other than "who is your
       brother's mother's uncle in relation to your grandfather?"   I
       mean, HUH?
       Seriously, there were a couple questions similar to that on the IQ
       test we took in HS.
       That labeling of "low IQ" held those kids back, not giving them
       attention and resources they deserved in school.  Nevertheless,
       many of them have gone on to be as successful as you can be in this
       world today. Good solid lives, good families, good kids of their
       own today.
       So..  IQ = fraud in my book.

   Alternative Right's senior editors are Peter Brimelow and Paul
   Gottfried. Brimelow founded VDARE.com, an anti-immigrant website, and
   he has described "Alternative Right" as a project of the VDARE
   Foundation. Gottfried has spoken at conferences of the white
   nationalist American Renaissance magazine, whose editor has written
   that black people are incapable of sustaining any kind of civilization.

   One of the bloggers at "Alternative Right" (Richard Hoste) wrote that
   "low-IQ Mexican immigration is the greatest threat to America."

 My great-grandfather ([877]0+ / 0-)

   You know folks said the same things about my great grandparents, the
   ones from Italy & Ireland.  Funny thing my paternal grandmother had an
   IQ through the roof, even though they pulled her from school after the
   8th grade to work in her father's grocery store.  My maternal
   grandmother was an English teacher until she married at the ripe old
   age of 28.  My maternal grandfather was an electrical engineer-went to
   Cooper Union graduated with honours.  My paternal grandfather was a NYC
   cop.  My father was brilliant & artist  ran his own roofing company for
   decades & my mother was first a banker then a headhunter for the
   banking industry.  My sisters & I all have IQ's that break the bank and
   have found our niche in society as have all of my cousins.  So this
   'study' is a load of shit, all he had to research was the same racist
   screeds written at the turn of the last century about those low-life
   Eye-Talians & Irish. That he was able to hand in such a POS as his
   dissertation defies description.  I expect shit like this from
   Heritage, they are a bunch of angry old white who don't like losing
