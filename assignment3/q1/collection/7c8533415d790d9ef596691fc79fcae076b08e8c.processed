     * Today's [29]comic by Matt Bors is [30]Avenging Uterus in
       Steubenville:

     * [32]Pakistanis arrest Qari Abdul Hayee, wanted for slaying of
       Daniel Pearl:

     Mr. Hayee, who also goes by the name of Asadullah, was identified as
     a weapons and explosives expert for Lashkar-e-Jhangvi Lashkar is
     Pakistan's most notorious sectarian militant outfit, and has
     returned to prominence this year after it claimed responsibility for
     two devastating bombings in the western city of Quetta that killed
     about 200 Shiites, mostly from the ethnic Hazara minority. [...]

     Mr. Pearl was abducted in January 2002 in Karachi and beheaded the
     next month. His killing sent shock waves throughout the world and
     shed a light on the growing nexus of Al Qaeda and Pakistani militant
     groups.
     * [33]Tempest in teapot without the tea: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz objected
       to a congressional resolution commemorating Multiple Sclerosis
       Awareness Week last week. Typically, such resolutions are passed in
       bulk lots without objection.

     "Senator Cruz does not oppose the substance of the MS resolution,
     and he never did," his spokesman said. "Unfortunately, the sponsors
     of this resolution circulated their request for unanimous consent
     less than 48 hours before they wanted it passed.  A member of Sen.
     Cruz's staff--who herself suffers from MS--asked for time to review
     the language, and to perhaps suggest revisions to the language, as
     is typical.  It appears that Senate Democratic staff, instead of
     working to ensure unanimous consent, instead decided to leak this
     story to try to malign Senator Cruz."
     * [34]More smackdown of Candy Crowley, et al., over making rapists
       victims:

     While we're at it: CNN repeatedly referred to the victim as "drunk"
     or "drunken," rather than the more accurate "out cold." The defense
     of Steubenville [law enforcement] has conveniently omitted its
     complete disinterest in the illegal use, procurement, or provision
     of alcoholic beverages, as well as a goddam crowd's disinterest in
     the girl's parlous physical condition; threatened prosecution of
     either might have loosened some tongues. I was also amused by the
     recurring theme that Steubenville's "tough economic times"
     encouraged people to rally 'round the hopeful symbol of high school
     football. Y'know, they're riding out the downturn pretty well in
     Carmel, Indiana, which didn't seem to stop them from treating
     forceable sodomy by object on a basketball team bus as just a right
     of passage, and no one else's bidness. Essentially.
     * [35]A visual on that $6 trillion dollar war in Iraq:  Tasneem Raja
       at Mother Jones reports:

     According to the first-ever comprehensive count of the true toll of
     the combined wars, the estimate the administration used to sell the
     invasion in 2003 was about 100 times too low.
     * [36]Be happy. Facebook can lift those dark clouds:

     According to a new pilot study conducted by Dr. Alice Good of the
     University of Portsmouth, the vast majority of Facebook users use
     the social network to lift their spirits when they're feeling down
     by navigating their old photos and wall posts in which they've
     interacted with family and friends--a "self-soothing" coping
     mechanism somewhat akin to flipping through a photo album or
     watching old home videos.
     * [37]Five Katrinas a Decade? Thank global warming:

     By examining the frequency of extreme storm surges in the past,
     previous research has shown that there was an increasing tendency
     for storm hurricane surges when the climate was warmer. But how much
     worse will it get as temperatures rise in the future? How many
     extreme storm surges like that from Hurricane Katrina, which hit the
     U.S. coast in 2005, will there be as a result of global warming? New
     research from the Niels Bohr Institute show that there will be a
     tenfold increase in frequency if the climate becomes two degrees
     Celcius warmer.

       On today's [39]Kagro in the Morning show, Greg Dworkin helps kick
       off discussion of the 10th anniversary of the Iraq war, and gives
       us as good a reason as any to focus on the Republican history of
       being wrong on pretty much everything, since forever. Let's find
       bipartisan compromise with the guys who sabotaged Vietnam peace
       talks and the Iranian hostage negotiations to win elections,
       conducted Iran-Contra and the disaster of Iraq, predicted economic
       doom from the 1993 Clinton economic stimulus and the passage of
       both Social Security and Medicare, and have been "reaching out" to
       minorities for 40 years!

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Cyprus Parliament Rejects Deposit Tax For Bailout ([158]7+ / 0-)

     Cyprus Parliament Rejects Deposit Tax For Bailout

     The European debt crisis is back.

     The Cypriot parliament on Tuesday soundly defeated a controversial
     bailout proposal that would have taxed bank deposits, marking a new
     and uncertain phase in a crisis that until very recently had seemed
     to be quelled.

     The Cyprus bailout plan, proposed by the European Union, European
     Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, sparked outrage from
     the moment of its introduction. Cypriot officials altered the terms
     of the plan to ease the pain on Cypriots with small bank deposits,
     but it was not enough to win passage. In fact, the bailout plan
     received no votes, with the ruling party of resident Nicos
     Anastasiades abstaining from voting at all.

     Financial markets initially reacted with surprising calm to the
     news, perhaps because the vote's eventual outcome had become more
     predictable throughout the day. Shortly after the vote, the euro was
     down only about 0.5 percent to a little less than $1.29. In the
     U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average was only slightly lower after
     the news, down about 20 points -- not even its lowest levels of the
     day.

   [167]http://www.reuters.com/...

     Cyprus lawmakers reject bank tax; bailout in disarray

     (Reuters) - Cyprus's parliament overwhelmingly rejected a proposed
     levy on bank deposits as a condition for a European bailout on
     Tuesday, throwing euro zone efforts to rescue the latest casualty of
     the currency area's debt crisis into disarray.

     The vote by the small state's legislature was a stunning setback for
     the 17-nation euro zone, after lawmakers in Greece, Portugal,
     Ireland, Spain and Italy had repeatedly accepted unpopular austerity
     measures over the last three years to secure European aid.

     The rejection, with 36 votes against, 19 abstentions and one
     absence, brought the east Mediterranean island, one of the smallest
     European states, to the brink of financial meltdown.

     EU countries said before the vote that they would withhold 10
     billion euros ($12.89 billion) in bailout loans unless depositors in
     Cyprus shared the cost of the rescue, and the European Central Bank
     has threatened to end emergency lending assistance for teetering
     Cypriot banks.

   which result in my posting [175]considering an uncertain future.  As I
   noted at the time, it was a form of sorting out my own thoughts, and in
   sharing the process of doing that I hope it may be of benefit to at
   least one other person.

   It also opens me to listen to what others may offer back.  To be open
   like that perhaps may make me vulnerable, but that is less important
   than that it provides the possibility of human connection.

   Peace.

   ...(even including deaths), it doesn't come close to the cost of our
   healthcare system (even under the ACA).

   There will still be about 25,000 unnecessary death by year for lack of
   insurance.  This adds up to at least 1,000,000 unnecessary deaths by
   2053.

   But if we had a Canadian stile Single Payer system, not only nobody
   would die (or go bankrupt) because of lack of access to healthcare, by
   eliminating the for profit insurance blood suckers we would save (not
   counting interest) at least $16 trillion by 2053.

     And of course, hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost,
     damaged, and tragically altered in the meantime. The "Costs of War"
     report estimates 134,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed,
     cautioning that the real number could be four times higher. As
     Reuters put it, "the report concluded the United States gained
     little from the war, while Iraq was traumatized by it."
     The war reinvigorated radical Islamist militants in the region, set
     back women's rights, and weakened an already precarious healthcare
     system, the report said. Meanwhile, the $212 billion reconstruction
     effort was largely a failure with most of that money spent on
     security or lost to waste and fraud, it said.

   The circle chart up top is nice but misleading. Humans have a much

   (1-dimensional).  People would tend not to see the 6 trillion circle as

   better to use length or put it in dots so the magnitudes are visually
