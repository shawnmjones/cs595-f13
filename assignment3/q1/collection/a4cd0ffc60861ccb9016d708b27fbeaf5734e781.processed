   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   afterwards.

 Here is a comment that I am sure will get ([109]1+ / 0-)

   get many HR's.

   While I support the many talented cartoonist on DK, I would rather have
   1800 hrs. be an OT. The number of rec's for cartoons seem to support my
   view.

   Idea, why not have 1800 hrs, be both?*

       I don't comment much, but I read the site every single day. I like
       the addition of the comics to the front page, and would hate to see
       them relegated to the backwaters.
       As it is, I've had to do nothing in my RSS feed to see the great
       work they're doing. I like that.
       I'm probably not the only one.

       You can't keep a mighty tree alive (much less expect it to thrive)
       by only spritzing the fine leaves at its tippy-top. The fate of the
       whole tree depends on nurturing the grassroots. - Jim Hightower

 I liked the idea... ([122]0+ / 0-)

   ...but something about the execution of the idea didn't have Brian's
   usual punch.  But hey, I'll keep reading him.  I like his artwork and
   his political humor is usually more incisive.

   Can't hit one out of the park every time, but keep trying!

 Pretty weak cartoon... ([125]0+ / 0-)

   compared with McFadden's usual stuff.

   Maybe he's struggling with guilt and self-loathing because of the
