   Bill Gates at the National Academy of Sciences

   April 28, 2013 | By Bill Gates

Why We're Talking To Scientists About Toilets

   Melinda and I [13]spoke earlier today at the [14]National Academy of
   Sciences, a non-profit group that has advised the nation on important
   scientific matters for 150 years. The NAS has roughly 2,200 members,
   all scientists at the top of their respective fields. About 200 of them
   have Nobel prizes.

   Naturally, I took the opportunity to talk about toilets. Of course I
   also mentioned vaccines and other life-saving scientific advances.
   Melinda talked about the benefits of contraception and agriculture. But
   I put special emphasis on our [15]Reinvent the Toilet Challenge,
   because it's a great example of one of our biggest priorities:
   encouraging scientists to focus on the problems of the poor.
   Melinda Gates speaks at the National Academy of Sciences

   Scientific advances like the microprocessor and new medicines have been
   key in lifting millions of people around the world out of poverty. In
   my lifetime, extreme poverty has been cut in half. So have the number
   of people who don't have safe drinking water, and the number of mothers
   who die during childbirth.
   Bill Gates:

   But we can do even better. There are many life-saving discoveries that
   don't reach the developing world. Or they aren't tailored to meet the
   needs of the poor to begin with. The toilet for example has been
   essentially the same technology for 200 years, and it requires
   infrastructure like sewage systems that are out of reach for much of
   the world. That leads to open defecation and other problems--and 1.5
   million children who die each year from contaminated food and water. So
   Melinda and I made the case for finding more ways to make sure the poor
   are among the first, rather than the last, to benefit from scientific
   progress.

   Why the National Academy of Sciences? Because it's a group that
   represents one of the greatest resources we have in fighting poverty
   and disease: brainpower. Material scientists can make big advances on
   the next-generation toilet. Geneticists can develop new seeds that help
   farmers grow more nutritious food and raise their incomes. Energy
   researchers can create cheaper, cleaner forms of energy to meet the
   growing demand for it in the developing world.

   Here are some specific ways we're trying to use the power of science to
   benefit the poor:

   Reinventing the Toilet

   Many of us in the rich world take toilets for granted. But today 40
   percent of the world's population doesn't have access to them. Instead
   they resort to open defecation, which contaminates water and food
   supplies, killing 1.5 million children a year. Unfortunately, today's
   toilets require complex sewer infrastructure that won't work in many of
   these settings. So we need to design affordable toilets that work in
   these communities.

   Last year eight universities participated in a Reinvent the Toilet
   Challenge. We held a fair to celebrate the winner, and I got
   to [16]award prizes to the top three winners. It probably says
   something about me that I really had fun handing out prizes for toilet
   designs. [17]Read more about the Toilet Challenge >>

   SCUBA Rice

   In her speech, Melinda talked about the importance of providing farmers
   with new seeds. One example of this is the effort to [18]develop new
   varieties of rice that can thrive in areas of Asia and Africa, where
   rice yields are historically much lower than other parts of the world
   because of flooding, drought and poor soils. Partners from around the
   world are working to create rice that can "hold its breath" underwater.

   Grand Challenges

   In 1900, the German mathematician David Hilbert sparked a century of
   innovation in mathematics by identifying the 23 problems in that field
   that most needed solving. That's the model for the [20]Grand Challenges
   in Global Health. A panel of scientists has identified 16 challenges
   that, if solved, could lead to breakthrough advances for the developing
   world. They include everything from making vaccines that don't have to
   be refrigerated to preventing mosquitos from transmitting malaria.
