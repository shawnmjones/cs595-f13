Hearing officer recommends firing of 2 Montgomery County elections officials

   BY JIM PROVANCE
   BLADE COLUMBUS BUREAU CHIEF

   COLUMBUS -- A pair of Democrats on the Montgomery County Board of
   Elections who pushed for weekend early voting in violation of a
   directive from Ohio's top elections official should be fired, a state
   hearing officer recommended today.

   Secretary of State Jon Husted is expected to make a final decision on
   Tuesday.

   He saw the votes of Thomas J. Ritchie, Sr., and Dennis Lieberman as in
   defiance of his directive setting uniform hours across all 88 counties
   for in-person early voting for the Nov. 6 election. That directive
   provided for expanded weekday hours but made no mention of weekend
   hours.

   Jon Allison, a hearing officer working under contract with the
   secretary of state's office for this case only, did not accept the
   arguments of Mr. Ritchie and Mr. Lieberman last week that they saw
   their votes for weekend hours as augmenting the Republican secretary's
   directive, not defying it.

   He said that the original wording of the directive and a follow-up
   clarification letter from Mr. Husted's deputy assistant made the
   secretary's intent clear.

   "I conclude that no reasonable person... could conclude that [the
   directive] is ambiguous and permits weekend hours for in person
   absentee voting," Mr. Allison wrote. "Therefore, I conclude that Mr.
   Lieberman, in making his motion, voting for it, and later refusing to
   rescind it did so in contravention of [the directive] and in violation
   of [state law].

   "Mr. Ritchie, who seconded the motion and voted for it, also did so in
   violation of [state law]," he wrote.

   On Aug. 20, Mr. Husted suspended the two Democrats after they
   deadlocked 2-2 with Republicans on the board over the scheduling of
   weekend hours.

   Last week, following a hearing before Mr. Allison, Mr. Husted
   temporarily reinstated them so they could continue to make some
   election-related decisions while the case was pending.

   Voters may begin to cast absentee ballots by mail or in person
   beginning on Oct. 2.

   With county boards of elections setting their own early-voting hours,
   Mr. Husted faced criticism for breaking 2-2 ties in a number of
   Democrat-performing urban counties, including Lucas, in favor of
   Republicans' positions of not adding any extra hours at board of
   elections sites for in-person early voting.

   At the same time, a number of boards in Republican-performing counties
   had reached bipartisan agreements that expanded early voting hours
   there, including on Saturdays.

   Mr. Husted responded with his directive establishing one set of hours
   for everyone.
