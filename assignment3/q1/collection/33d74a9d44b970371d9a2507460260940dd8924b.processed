   [29][p4lki5fvm940htl63fe8_normal.png] Obama's numbers bouncing. Early
   week Gallup tracking showed 45% approval for 2 days in a row, now at
   50% for 2 days [30]http://t.co/...
   -- [31]@CookPolitical
   [32][Me_for_twitter_normal.jpg] @CookPolitical @DemFromCT Like they
   always do. Which is why it's best to avoid freaking out over the most
   recent bounce.
   -- [33]@MysteryPollster
   [34]CJR:

     In the US Senate, filibusters are routinely used to block
     legislation, but "talking filibusters" are so rare that when Sen.
     Rand Paul (R-KY) launched one earlier this year to raise questions
     about the Obama administration's use of drones for targeted killing,
     it became a social media sensation. When Wendy Davis rose to the
     Senate floor in Austin Tuesday, she had a very specific goal in
     mind: to run out the clock on the abortion bill. But she was also,
     like Paul, creating a media event.

   [35]KCBS had the story as it broke:

     SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) -- The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
     based in San Francisco, filed an order late Friday afternoon
     allowing same-sex marriages to resume in California immediately.

   [36]Washington Blade:

     Gay federal employees in legal same-sex marriages will be eligible
     immediately for health and pension benefits in the aftermath of the
     Supreme Court ruling against Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage
     Act, according to a new memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel
     Management.

   [37][c02003ea177ebab67edea04be35b2694_normal.png] Each action raises
   more questions -- and there's a lot more out there that hasn't been
   touched this week -- but, this week was historic.
   -- [38]@chrisgeidner
   More politics and policy below the fold.

   [39]John Avlon:

     Credit goes to the "Courageous 14" Republican senators who joined
     with the Democratic majority to make this legislation pass by a
     towering bipartisan margin of 68 to 32. Building squarely on the
     tireless efforts of the Gang of Eight--led by Marco Rubio, Chuck
     Schumer, Robert Menendez, and John McCain--the bill's passage was a
     timely reminder that common ground is the only practical
     problem-solving space on Capitol Hill. That matters if you believe
     Congress should be more than an ideological debating society.

     But the first among equals in the profile in courage sweepstakes is
     Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Of all the Gang of Eight senators, he
     was the most unvarnished in his advocacy and he has the most to
     lose.

   Good argument for crediting Graham, at least a little. Worth a read.

   [40]Richard Posner:

     Shelby County v. Holder, decided Tuesday, struck down a key part of
     the Voting Rights Act (the part requiring certain states with a
     history of racial discrimination in voting to obtain federal
     permission in advance to change their voting procedures--called
     "preclearance") as violating the "fundamental principle of equal
     sovereignty" of the states. This is a principle of constitutional
     law of which I had never heard--for the excellent reason that, as
     Eric points out and I will elaborate upon briefly, there is no such
     principle.

   Worth a second, or a first, read.

   [41]Denver Post on the "moribund" (as some describe it) gun legislation
   efforts:

     At the Firing Line gun shop in Aurora, assorted guns are marked with
     red tags reading: "Not for sale after June 30." "We can sell the
     gun, but we won't be able to sell the magazine with it, so what's
     the point?" said Richard Taylor, the store's manager.

     New Colorado gun-control laws inspired feverish debate among
     politicians, law enforcement and residents during the last
     legislative session resulting in a lawsuit against the governor,
     criminal threats of violence and lawmaker recall efforts.

   Needless to say, the bad behavior wasn't on the part of gun
   responsibility proponents. And [42]there's this now:

     The front group trying to stave off a fall recall election of Senate
     President John Morse unveiled Friday what they billed as "explosive
     revelations" of forgery by petitioners who gathered enough
     signatures in an effort to oust the state lawmaker from office.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Another step toward universal health care? ([80]10+ / 0-)

       My guess is that the number of same sex couples in the nation is an
       order of magnitude greater than we suspect. This change in how the
       nation treats its citizens may have unforseen benefits in the
       health care arena as well. When a partner accesses benefits, he/she
       begins to get earlier diagnoses and treatments and the entire
       family is healthier. Of course, there will be impacts on social
       security as well, generally for the better because the small bump
       up a spouse might get by claiming spousal benefits rather than
       individual would be put right back into the economy.
       13 states? My guess is that in two years it will be the majority.

 Graham has been paving his way for this vote ([201]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [202]Greg Dworkin

       by being a raving lunatic on Bengahzi and other subjects earlier
       this year. He's been INSANE, and I'm assuming it's because he was
       going to want to vote for this, his pet project for close to a
       decade.
       Also, one of the reasons Graham is interested in immigration reform
       is because agriculture is a big, big deal down here in SC, and
       keeping labor costs low on the farm is important. One way to keep
       the salaries of local people (the state is approximately 30% native
       AA) under control is to keep the flow of labor competition coming,
       especially the kind of competition which will do practically
       anything, over practically any hours, for practically nothing, all
       in our freeeeeeedom loving "Right to Work" state.

   in the short term but I do recall a series of very public speeches
   President Obama gave over the winter resulted in a bump. That bump is
   significant because he was out there telling the truth about things and
   people were listening. So much of what doesn't get done is because
   people believe the bullshit peddled from the right, and they are damn
   good at getting in front of many issues, solidifying the narrative &

     The decline matters for three reasons.

     First, it matters for the 2014 election...
     Second, it matters for the 2016 election...
     Third, it matters for whether the President gets what he wants from
     Congress--with some caveats.

       no way that Hispanics could ever join the GOP because of their
       penchant for having babies out of wedlock and their addiction to
       public assistance and government programs.
       She continued to state that Hispanics were "as bad as Blacks" in
       terms of out of wedlock births and dependence on public assistance.
       However she then went on to say the GOP would not need the
       Hispanics so long as the GOP was able to rally its white base and
       recruit the "Black population".  This threw me for a minute given
       her earlier complaint about African Americans and their out of
       wedlock kids and public assistance but she continued to explain
       that the Black community and GOP whites agree on many social issues
       such as abortion and marriage equality.
       Wonder how this strategy will work for her and the GOP in the

   slashes unemployment  and loses federal benefits:

     State officials adopted the package of benefit cuts and increased
     taxes for businesses in February, a plan designed to accelerate
     repayment of a $2.5 billion federal debt. Like many states, North
     Carolina had racked up the debt by borrowing from Washington after
     its unemployment fund was drained by jobless benefits during the
     Great Recession.

     The changes go into effect Sunday for North Carolina, which has the
     country's fifth-worst jobless rate. The cuts on those who make
     unemployment claims on or after that day will disqualify the state
     from receiving federally funded Emergency Unemployment Compensation.
     That money kicks in after the state's period of unemployment
     compensation -- now shortened from up to six months to no more than
     five -- runs out. The EUC program is available to long-term jobless
     in all states. But keeping the money flowing includes a requirement
     that states can't cut average weekly benefits.

     Because North Carolina leaders cut average weekly benefits for new
     claims, about 170,000 workers whose state benefits expire this year
     will lose more than $700 million in EUC payments, the U.S. Labor
     Department said.

   Here's the disconnect from Republicans:

     The changes go into effect Sunday for North Carolina, which has the
     country's fifth-worst jobless rate.

     The cuts also will push people to find work faster, then move to a
     better job as the economy improves, she said.

     including perhaps some members of the media.
     ...
     Dewhurst says he's prepared for the next attempt to derail the

          [515]SanAntonioKrusty, [516]snazzzybird, [517]One Opinion

     When Wendy Davis rose to the Senate floor in Austin Tuesday, she had
     a very specific goal in mind: to run out the clock on the abortion
     bill. But she was also, like Paul, creating a media event.

   The difference is that Ms. Davis staged her "media event" principally
   to achieve a noble objective and to illustrate how unconcerned the
   radical Republicans are with the people's interests and concerns.  Mr.
   Paul stages his stunts, mainly, as a means to promote his supposed
   viability as a presidential candidate; any nod toward improving the
   general good often seems like a secondary goal.

   Or, more simply, Ms. Davis understands that she is working
   cooperatively and collaboratively with and on behalf of others; hers
   are collective victories; Mr. Paul is trying, desperately, to display
   himself as an independent who can score points on his own (and largely
   for his own benefit).

   The lazy press, however, must play its "both sides are equally guilty"
   meme, to accomplish its own ends, which are increasingly self-serving
   and unsatisfactory in actually divulging news.

 Filibuster Clarification ([530]5+ / 0-)

   Let's be clear, there is really no comparison between what Rand Paul
   did on the floor of the US Senate and what Wendy Davis did on the floor
   of the Texas Senate.

   What Paul did was only a "talking filibuster" in the sense that he was
   talking during a filibuster period.  He chose to talk during a
   filibuster.  He was not compelled to talk to keep it going.  Whether he
   spoke or not, under the rules he could not prevent a scheduled Cloture
   vote that with 60 votes, would end the filibuster.

   What Wendy Davis did was truly a "talking filibuster" in that she was
   compelled to keep talking in order to keep the filibuster going until
   the end of the session, under the most harshest of rules I might add.
   Rules that prevented any of her colleagues from helping out, and which
   imposed physical restrictions on her that some might equate to the kind
   of torture the CIA might use on a terrorist suspect.

   What Paul did was talk.  What Davis did was Mr. Smith on steroids!

   could convince me that the authors of the Fifteenth Amendment thought
   South Carolina should be treated the same way as Massachusetts.

 The Posner piece is very interesting ([542]0+ / 0-)

   He is commonly considered a conservative, but now that the Republican
   Party and the court's right wing have both moved so far right, he
   sounds downright progressive.  The position he stakes out in his
   article was basic fundamental Conservative 101 from about 25-30 years
   ago.  Now, no winger would support it.

 Principle of what? ([545]0+ / 0-)

   If a Supreme Court Justice outright lies in his judgement before the
   court, does he have to sit in a corner with a dunce cap on his head or
   something?

   Inventing a Principle that doesn't exist and using it to claim as basis
   for the Majority's opinion should literally invalidate the entire
   ruling in my book. If I could fabricate evidence to get me out of a
   criminal felony I would be put in jail. In college if I submitted a
   proof on a submitted paper based on a lie the instructor would fail it
   in an instance. What allows a Supreme Court Justice that is supposed to
   be the cream of the Constitutional Law crop to invent crap like this?

   Principle of Covering His Ass?

 Well, "right of privacy" isn't much different ([548]0+ / 0-)
       It also isn't in the Constitution; Justice Brandeis (I think it
       was) basically cobbled it together out of the shadow of the 4th
       Amendment and the 9th and I forget what else, and here we are. Most
       progressives think it's enshrined in the Constitution and cite it
       regularly. Most right-wingers know (correctly) that it was
       invented, and relatively recently (= since the Civil War) at that.
       It makes them angry at "activist judges", and with some validity.
       And don't get me started on the weak legal basis for Roe v. Wade.
       So yes, this is one where "both sides do it" has some validity.
       I would not go where Roberts has gone, not at all. But inventing
       legal doctrines to fit the case in front of you is a fairly
       well-worn pathway.
