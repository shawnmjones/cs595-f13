   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   [DEL: 10 :DEL] [DEL: 9 :DEL] [DEL: 8 :DEL] 7 Weeks to Netroots Nation!

   Yup---we're under the 50-day mark as the countdown to the [29]big
   convention in San Jose continues. Here's your weekly dose of info:

     o Volunteers are needed to make everything run smoothly at the
     convention. Linda is putting out the call for a few good men and
     women:

     Yes, we are looking for volunteers! And if you're willing to work
     every day of the conference, we have an option for you to pay a
     ridiculously low registration fee. If you're interested in this, or
     volunteering in general, contact Eric Thut at eric [at]
     netrootsnation.org.

     Besides helping to make the convention run smoothly, spending some
     time as a volunteer is a great way to meet people, especially if
     it's your first time at Netroots Nation. Plus it's just a blast.

   Netroiots Nation Register Now icon

     o The Netroots Nation/DFA/America's Voice scholarship competition is
     in its last days.  Winners get free passes to NN13 and
     accommodations. [30]Click here to apply or vote for your favorite
     candidates. The competition ends at 11:59pm May 7th. There are some
     great candidates, so go check 'em out and vote 'em up. They thank ya
     kindly.

     o Fun Fact: San Jose is represented by two
     congresscritters---[31]Mike Honda in the 17th District (one-third of
     San Jose), and [32]Zoe Lofgren in the 19th. Both dependable
     Democrats.

     o Have you seen the list of panels yet? You can [33]check 'em out
     here.

     o To register for the convention, [34]click here. And for official
     hotel info, [35]click here. I have it on good authority (my cat)
     that instead of a mint they put a pie on your pillow.

     o Follow NN13 on Twitter [36]here and on Facebook [37]here.

   If you write for another blog, feel free to catapult this info so we
   can get the word out to as many people as possible. The more the
   merrier, I say. (I hear that's also true about orgies, bottles of beer
   on the wall and waffles.)

   Meanwhile, Cheers and Jeers starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!]
   RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!]

   Cheers and Jeers for Thursday, May 2, 2013

   Note: Another sign that spring has finally arrived in Maine: the kitty
   de-winged her first housefly of the year yesterday.  [Sigh]  They grow
   up and become sadistic predators so fast...

   Your Thursday Molly Ivins Moment:
   Molly ivins publicity photo &nbsp;--- small

     [A]pproximately one fourth of all fertilized eggs are swept out on
     the menstrual tide before they even get near to implanting
     themselves in the uterine wall, and we do not hold funerals over
     Kotex or Tampax. I suggest to you this means that the beginning of
     life is not a single specific event, but rather a process that
     deserves increasing respect as it continues toward birth---precisely
     the tripartite system set up under Roe v. Wade (and if you hear Roe
     v. Wade described as "abortion on demand," you are listening to a
     liar).

     I respect those who oppose abortion, but I do not think they have a
     right to use the law as an instrument of coercion against people who
     do not believe (and it is a matter of faith) as they do. ... There
     were an estimated one million abortions a year in this country
     before Roe. Abortion can be safe and legal, or dirty and illegal. It
     cannot be stopped.

   CHEERS to a very gay day.  The tidal wave of wins in the American LGBT
   movement continues.  Cue the bullet list:

     o Civil unions are now the law [40]in Colorado.

   Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee
   Linc Chafee's signature on Rhode Island's marriage
   bill will mean equality in every New England state.
   -

     o Marriage passed through committee and is headed for a full senate
     vote [41]in Delaware.

     o It's possible that today the final marriage bill will pass a
     perfunctory procedural vote and be signed by Governor Lincoln Chafee
     [42]in Rhode Island.

     o And a day after Washington Wizards center Jason Collins came out
     of the closet, online sales of his "98" jersey (to commemorate the
     year Matthew Shepard was murdered, a classy gesture of remembrance)
     [43]are off the charts.  Meanwhile, sales of [44]Chris Broussard
     jerseys: negative to infinity.

   Bigots: we're ready to accept your unconditional surrender.  Preferably
   on the battleship the Village People used to shoot "In the Navy."
   (It's a bucket list thing.)

   JEERS to wondering if you should've closed the barn door 13 years after
   the horse left and died of old age.  Former Supreme Court justice
   Sandra Day O'Connor, furiously trying to erase the blackest stain on
   her record, now wonders if maybe the court [45]made a mistake taking
   Bush v. Gore and handing the White House keys to what turned out to be
   a catastrophic president and his warmonger veep.  But I seem to
   remember that when O'Connor heard that Gore might win back in 2000, she
   made it pretty clear about [46]where she stood:
   Window repair
   Repairing the window that
   my respect for Sandra Day
   O'Connor escaped from.

     O'Connor and her husband, John, a Washington lawyer, have long been
     comfortable on the cocktail and charity-ball circuit. So at an
     election-night party on Nov. 7, surrounded for the most part by
     friends and familiar acquaintances, she let her guard drop for a
     moment when she heard the first critical returns shortly before 8
     p.m. Sitting in her hostess's den, staring at a small
     black-and-white television set, she visibly started when CBS anchor
     Dan Rather called Florida for Al Gore. "This is terrible," she
     exclaimed. [...]

     Moments later, with an air of obvious disgust, she rose to get a
     plate of food, leaving it to her husband to explain her somewhat
     uncharacteristic outburst. John O'Connor said his wife was upset
     because they wanted to retire to Arizona, and a Gore win meant
     they'd have to wait another four years.

   Given the opportunity, she and her four conservative pals on the court
   installed Bush. Her replacement: Alito.  Now she's thinking she might
   like takesie backsies, if it's not too much trouble.  Hey, MIT---how's
   that time machine coming along?

   CHEERS to #32.  Sixteen years ago today, a [47]national memorial
   honoring Franklin Delano Roosevelt officially opened in Washington,
   D.C., making FDR only the 4th president to get such VIP treatment.
   FDR Memorial bronze statue
   FDR and Fala. Friends 4evuh.

     [T]he monument, spread over 7.5 acres, traces 12 years of the
     history of the United States through a sequence of four outdoor
     rooms, one for each of FDR's terms of office. Sculptures inspired by
     photographs depict the 32nd president alongside his dog Fala. Other
     sculptures depict scenes from the Great Depression, such as
     listening to a fireside chat on the radio and waiting in a bread
     line, a bronze sculpture by George Segal. A bronze statue of First
     Lady Eleanor Roosevelt standing before the United Nations emblem
     honors her dedication to the UN. It is the only presidential
     memorial to depict a First Lady.

   All Reagan got was a dumb airport in the 'burbs named after him.  And
   George W. will be lucky if he can convince anyone to name a one-holer
   at a rest stop after his sorry ass.

   JEERS to Tsarnaev's little helpers.  Three suspects [48]have been
   arrested for allegedly being recruited by Dzokhar Tsarnaev to help him
   erase his tracks after the Boston Marathon bombing.  To quote the
   knight in the third Indiana Jones movie: He chose...poooorly.

   CHEERS to the days of jobs and surpluses.  On May 2, 1997, President
   Clinton and congressional Republicans came to terms on a plan to
   [49]balance the budget over five years.  Said Newt Gingrich of the
   bipartisan agreement: "This is a great moment for our children and our
   grandchildren and our country, and we are proud to be part of that."
   Fourteen years later, as a presidential candidate, Gingrich foolishly
   raised his hand when asked if he would veto a budget with ten dollars
   in cuts for every 1 dollar in revenue increases.  But in fairness, he
   did also offer jobs to our children and grandchildren.  As janitors.
   So be grateful, ya little shits.

   Five years ago in C&J: May 2, 2008

   CHEERS to the mane event.  In tomorrow's Kentucky Derby, Hillary
   Clinton is putting her money on [50]Eight Bells.  Barack Obama seems to
   be backing [51]Colonel John.  And John McCain is rooting for whichever
   horse supports bombing Iran.

   And just one more...
   Cartoon tombstone
   "Oh my god! We killed Kenny!"
   "You bastards!"
   CHEERS to the end of an era.  We're feeling a little blue this morning
   in Portland, Maine.  We've lost a trusted companion.  Kenny led a clean
   existence.  Loved soaps and squeezed every last drop out of life.  Oh,
   sure, some accused Kenny of being an agitator.  Others said Kenny was a
   master of spin.  But Kenny could be quite delicate at times, believed
   strongly in a permanent press, and took on some seriously dirty
   business while we were off distracting ourselves with frivolous things.
    Sadly, after a thorough examination we were told by a specialist that
   Kenny had died of old age.  There was nothing we could do but throw a
   sheet over Kenny and call the junk hauler.  So this morning please join
   Michael and me in bidding a sudsy farewell to Kenny, our 20 year-old
   Kenmore heavy-duty washing machine.  We'll miss you, buddy.  You were
   always---[Sniff]---full of Cheer.

   Have a nice Thursday.  Happy Birthday, Jed Lewison---and many blessings
   on your camels.  Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about
   today?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [69]Civil
   Rights, [70]Community, [71]Congress, [72]Culture, [73]Economy,
   [74]Education, [75]Elections, [76]Energy, [77]Environment, [78]Health
   Care, [79]International, [80]Labor, [81]Law, [82]Media, [83]Meta,
   [84]National Security, [85]Science, [86]Transportation, or [87]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([88]California, [89]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Cheers to Debbie in ME for the Pill Pockets suggestion.  Catterina
       got her prednizone last night with no problems.  Hopefully this
       will lessen her pain and generally cheer her up.  Even by
       perpetually miffed torbie standards, she's been down lately.
       Cheers to a forced work-related travel date back to DC in the first
       week of June.  This means I get to go to a beach weekend, rock show
       down in the Outer Banks with Mrs grog and DC friends.  I also get
       to stay at a hotel during the actual work meetings near Nationals
       Park and the team just happens to be playing at home while I'm
       there.  Never been to the park so this is great and the travel
       costs are paid for by work, ie. you. ;)
       Cheers to my right ear "popping".  I've had a bad plugged ear for
       close to a month now.  I've tried ear drops, decongestants, etc.,
       to no avail.  However, the last couple of days, the ear has
       "popped" a bunch and that "I've got water in my ear" feeling has
       gotten better.  If not gone by next week, I'm gonna see a doctor.
       Cheers to a site visit.  I leave pretty much after I post this.
       Jeers that it's to Topeka.  Cheers that I get to "visit" one of the
       nicer liquor stores around, Devlins.  And Cheers that the
       Chinese/Korean/Japanese place right down the street is right down
       the street.
       Cheers to picking up an out-of-town attendee at the airport on
       Friday for this weekend miniature roleplaying game thingie.  Great
       guy to game with which will hopefully offset the asshole/douchebag
       I mentioned earlier in the week who has, alas, confirmed she'll be
       there.  Here's a final picture of something I pained for this

       While you're in DC--and as long as we're picking up the tab, and if
       you have time, and if there aren't any airport delays, and in
       between shows & partying, etc.....could you possibly drop in at

       a similar problem.  My doctor said I had wax build up in one ear.
       The druggist recommended ear drops that had a strong smell of a
       petroleum product of some sort.  After using them twice a day for
       one or two weeks, the  wax seemed to be gone - the hearing in the
       affected ear was back to being the same as the other ear.  I hope
       your problem clears up that easily.

   .......... and for a song of the week
   ........................................................ she never
   attained a Top 40 single, gold album or Grammy Award - being
   idiosyncratic can do that to you - but the music of [277]Laura Nyro
   lives on in the many musicians who had success covering her songs ...
   because in back-to-back weeks in 1969, three of the Top 10 songs on
   Billboard's singles chart were written by Nyro. And her work is being
   re-discovered, more than fifteen years after her death.

   The Bronx native (born Laura Nigro) was the daughter of a Jewish mother
   (who introduced her to opera and classical music) and an
   Italian-America father (a piano tuner and jazz trumpeter) and she
   attended - what was then known as - the [278]High School of Music & Art
   where Janis Ian was one of her classmates. Her performing actually
   began (informally) singing on street corners and subway tunnels (as
   Doo-wop singers often began). After graduation, her father's business
   contacts included record exec Artie Mogull, who signed her after a 1966
   audition.

   She sold her first song, "And When I Die," to Peter, Paul, and Mary for
   $5,000 and released her [279]debut album for Verve Folkways in 1967.
   The album (like her others) did not sell well, but was critically
   acclaimed and resulted in hits for [280]other artists - Blood, Sweat &
   Tears scored ([281]And When I Die - US #2), The 5th Dimension
   ([282]Wedding Bell Blues - US #1) and Barbra Streisand ([283]Stoney End
   - US #6).

   Later that summer, she appeared at the [284]Monterey Pop Festival - and
   she was convinced the audience was booing her, which took years to
   ascertain was not (in fact) the case. The festival did bring her to the
   attention of David Geffen - who bought out her former manager's
   contract and introduced her to Clive Davis at Columbia Records, who
   signed her to a contract. Interestingly, another group recording for
   Columbia (the aforementioned Blood, Sweat & Tears) asked her to
   [285]audition as the band's lead singer ... which she declined on the
   advice of Geffen (leading to the hiring of David Clayton-Thomas,
   instead).

   In 1968. Columbia released perhaps her best-loved album, [286]Eli and
   the Thirteenth Confession - which again spawned hits for the 5th
   Dimension ([287]Sweet Blindness and [288]Stoned Soul Picnic as well),
   and also "Eli's Comin'" for Three Dog Night. She had some excellent
   back-up musicians: veteran session players Hugh McCracken and Chuck
   Rainey, as well as some jazz stalwarts (Zoot Sims and Joe Farrell). At
   this time, she offered the job as musical director of her back-up band
   to [289]Todd Rundgren - who turned it down due to his work with
   [290]The Nazz at the time.

   I mentioned her idiosyncratic ways: Janis Ian spoke of her dressed all
   in black, with a some distant presence onstage. Clive Davis saying she
   auditioned for him via candlelight. Her music was a blend of folk,
   singer-songwriter, R&B and jazz, which made her difficult for radio
   stations to characterize. She turned down lucrative film-composing
   offers, although she contributed a rare protest song to the Academy
   Award-winning documentary [291]Broken Rainbow - about the unjust
   relocation of the Navajo people. More pertinently: she seldom gave
   interviews and rarely toured  ... at a time when this could have helped
   boost her career.

   And this became more of a factor when her 1969 album [292]New York
   Tendaberry was released, which did not spawn any hit singles ... still,
   it garnered some excellent reviews and this compliment from the jazz
   trumpet legend [293]Miles Davis - who was asked to contribute to an
   instrumental section, but once he heard what had already been recorded
   he is reported to have replied, "I can't play on this. You already did
   it."

   Her next album [294]Christmas and the Beads of Sweat featured half of
   its tracks backed by the legendary Muscle Shoals studio musicians (such
   as Dave Hood and Roger Hawkins) and the rest by musicians such as the
   Rascals' Felix Cavaliere, Duane Allman and John Coltrane's widow Alice
   (an accomplished pianist herself). Interestingly, for someone who had
   written all of her own songs on recordings:  a cover of Gerry Goffin
   and Carole King's [295]Up on the Roof became her only single to reach
   the lower ranks of the Hot 100 (peaking at #92).

   And that perhaps is why her album [296]Gonna Take a Miracle - from 1971
   and completing her contract with Columbia - consisted of solely R&B
   covers .... backed up by the trio LaBelle who made this a memorable
   album (albeit one without substantial radio airplay). And then in 1971
   at age 24, Laura Nyro got married and ..... retired. Cold.

   She returned later that decade after her marriage broke up (and she
   lost her mother to ovarian cancer) ..... but her music was never the
   same. [297]Smile from 1976 was more subdued and while she still
   garnered decent reviews (and had excellent musicians such as the
   Brecker brothers back her) both Maria Muldaur and Joni Mitchell had
   moved into her territory (with much higher record sales). After her
   [298]next album which had similarly disappointing sales, she left the
   music business again for several years.

   It was not until the mid-80's that she returned to the music business.
   She was again more subdued, but found more personal songs that her
   first comeback and began performing live, with a well-received
   [299]Live at the Bottom Line album. In 1988 she had her first major
   tour in nearly ten years.

   Her last studio album she would see released was [300]Walk the Dog &
   Light the Light from 1993, ten years since she had released an album of
   new material. Four years later in April 1997, the ovarian cancer than
   had taken her mother's life .. [301]claimed hers, as well. Her
   [302]final recordings were released four years later. A few months
   after her death, fourteen female artists recorded a [303]tribute album
   of her songs.

   Her legacy is quite solid as she has influenced many, including Kate
   Bush, Tori Amos, Suzanne Vega, Jane Siberry and Rickie Lee Jones. There
   is a 2002 [304]biography of her, an excellent [305]compilation album of
   her works, there was a [306]theatrical revue of her songs that went
   onstage in 2001 .... and there are plans for [307]a film of her life,
   though these projects are notoriously difficult to get off the ground
   (see "Joplin movie, Janis" for an example).

   Laura Nyro was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll [308]Hall of
   Fame just last year .... and one of the other inductees for 2012 was
   [309]Donovan - who said on several occasions how glad he was to go in
   at the same time as Laura Nyro.

                         [312][LNy3_zps749e79c1.jpg]

   Of all of her songs, it is [313]Save the Country - her reaction to
   Robert Kennedy's assassination in June, 1968 - that is my favorite.
   Besides the 5th Dimension, it has been recorded by Brian Auger/Julie
   Driscoll as well as Roseanne Cash ... and [314]below you can hear it
   (plus [315]at this link the more polished 5th Dimension version).

     And the precious king
     He loved the people to sing

   How I loved Laura Nyro. She was so singular, so unlike anyone else, her
   music so unique. You knew you were in the presence of greatness.

   When I was 17, I drove from Southern California to Canada by myself.
   Windows open, highway pulsing, wind blowing through my hair, and Laura
   Nyro on 8-track playing the whole way through. I cranked up her music
   as loud as it would go -- Mercy On Broadway, Time and Love, Captain
   Saint Lucifer, Eli's Coming, Poverty Train.

   Oh, word. Laura Nyro was the soundtrack of my life. I saw her play in a
   small club not long before she died. Even 30 years later, no longer a
   wild-eyed kid pointing my car toward the Canadian Rockies, I felt I was
   in the presence of God.

   There was no one like her. RIP Laura Nyro.

   It was recorded this way for release as a single and for some reason
   I've always preferred it. I always adored Laura Nyro; I saw her perform
   several times at various places, while I was still in college.

   You know, she lived the latter part of her life in a relationship with

       middle school. The GOP would love this kid, all bootsraps and all
       but he really did have a hard life, responsibility at home far
       outreaching his age and managed to get straight "A"s, be highly
       popular, and a total girl-killer in the looks department to boot.
       "Don't listen to your parents and teachers, you're just as smart as
       anyone else" I once heard him tell a frustrated fellow student who
       was obviously struggling with something at home.
       Years later that kid tracked down my email address just to let me
       know that he went to college. I can guarantee you, if he had
       listened to what school and family were trying to do to him, he'd
       be cutting your lawn today.

       is a bit more than one acre. My doctor told me I needed to use a
       riding mower. Fine, until it wouldn't stay running. So I bought a
       walk-behind with self-propulsion. I stroll while I mow, one hand on
       the mower.
       The other is usually carrying a bottle of water. I need to rig up a

   point A to point B -- until I drove my husband's car. It took awhile,
   but now it's all mine. I invent errands just so I can drive.

       It isn't just for point a to b.
       I USED to own a 1978 280 ZX.
       THAT was an awesome car. I'd get up at 2 am, drive it through the
       little 20 mph town at about 85 MPH, spin it around, zoom back home
       and go back to bed.
       It was awesome. AND 27 mpg at 75 mph.
       The new car has a non-descript workhorse of a 4 cylinder engine
       which is awesome, but it's nothing to write home about. It will
       haul the thing down the road and 55-80 happens in a blink. I'm
       pulling 30+ mpg on the hwy and 20 - 22 in-town depending on
       traffic.
       The WHOLE vehicle is the deal now: AWD means it goes to the
       mountains, goes up and down "road-like trails" in the wilderness.
       But I have zero desire to get in it just to 'drive'.

   188,000 miles on it. 5-speed. Lots of punch. I'll get another 100,000
   out of it.

   I had a 2003 Forester that was loaded. (I miss the 6-disc cd changer).
   One extremely foggy morning, I missed a stop sign and wound up upside
   down in a 6' deep drainage ditch. The roof didn't crush at all.

   I am never stuck in snow.

   My wife has a condition that enflames her hip joints, so she can't
   drive a standard anymore. I'd bought my son's Toyota Tacoma 5-speed
   pick-up for $500. Needed $1000 in clutch and brake work. I traded it to
   my friend for his daughter's 2001 Outback with automatic trans and
   heated seats so my wife will have a backup car to drive should her 2000
   Camry "see the meat". There are 163,000 miles on the Camry. I expect at
   least another 100,000 out of it. There are 212,000 miles on the '01
   Outback. I expect another 100,000 out of it. My friend maintained it
   and it is in wonderful shape and runs like a bear. I probably will take
   the Camry off the road next winter and have her drive the Subaru.

   If I have my way, I will own and drive nothing but Subaru until my
   driving days are through.

       scratchy Met cylinder recordings, though those are invaluable

   Cheers to sorta having the day off. At least I won't be going to the
   woods today. But it never ceases to amaze me how much stuff can pile up
   in a week when I'm away from home.

   Jeers to fire ants. In my brief absence, at least two new nests
   appeared in my yard. It's a never ending battle. As much as I hate
   using toxic chemicals, the poison comes out every time I see a nest. I
   try to stop 'em before the nests get too big, or they are even more
   difficult to control.

   Jeers to boneheaded construction jobs. Here in Georgia, construction
   projects are usually scheduled in a manner that keeps multiple lanes
   open on the major highways. But as I drove towards home on I-75 last
   night, traffic came to a screeching halt in all 3 lanes. Two miles
   later, there were signs warning of construction a mile down the road.
   Gee, thanks for the advance notice! The 3 lanes funneled abrupty into a
   single lane, for a construction job that was only a couple hundred feet
   long. Why didn't they wait until midnight to do it, when there's far
   less traffic?

   Multiply 3 lanes of cars and trucks by 3 miles of backup, and allow 50
   feet per vehicle, and you get 950 vehicles, each of whom had to wait 40
   minutes to get through the bottleneck. That's 633 wasted driver-hours
   in the jam that I saw. This might have been repeated for hours as new
   vehicles entered the mess. Not to mention the wasted fossil fuel.

   Is that enough math for one morning?

       I was involved in a publication on controlling Red Imported Fire
       Ants a few years ago and that was my main contribution.  You have
       to be careful not to scald yourself, but a couple of treatments
       with boiling water usually does the trick as fire ants have fairly
       shallow nests.  I got rid of a fire ant mound that way under our
       daughter's swing when we were living in Florida.
       You can't use this method for deep nesting ants like harvesters so
       it is limited.

       that invade my kitchen. Completely nontoxic, and then I'm forced to
       wipe my counters clean afterwards. Thus there's the added benefit
       of a cleaner kitchen.
       Since posting my screed, I've noticed that there are actually at
       least six new nests in my yard! The queen ants turn into egg-laying
       machines when the weather turns warm and damp. I will try the
       boiling water on the nests located in spots where I don't have to
       worry about killing the grass.

       Suppose there were four wrecks caused by people cruising along in
       the dark at 70mph and suddenly encountering a line of stopped
       traffic. The lanes were backed up for 5 miles for one hour, 7 miles
       for two hours, and 3 miles for a total of 8 hours.
       Assuming 2.3 persons per vehicle, how many total hours were wasted?

   snow fell farther to the east of us...up to 14 inches not far away in
   Wisconsin.

   Cheers to weekend festivals.
   Both the [1785]Cinco de Mayo and [1786]May Day festivals will be this
   weekend in the Twin Cities, so it will be lots of fun if the weather
   doesn't screw it up.

   Jeers to spring colds...I have one, and it sucks coughing and sneezing
   all the time.

   Cheers that I feel ok otherwise...no fever or headaches.

   Cheers to election season.
   This November will be interesting, as there will be a tough race for
   mayor, as well as a couple interesting battles for City Council,
   including my councilwoman.

   Jeers to election season.
   The Democratic city convention in June will be a long day, as we vote
   to endorse one of the mayoral candidates. With 3 very strong candidates
   and a number of lesser candidates, I anticipate many votes throughout
   the day without any of them getting the required 60% for the
   endorsement. I'll be bringing lots of Red Bull and reading materials.

   Cheers to spring.
   Finally getting buds on the trees, so won't be long before it's green
   again.

       We celebrated Cinco de Mayo a few days early last night at our
       weekly choir dinner. I contributed some chicken enchiladas with
       mole sauce, we also had some very tasty chile rillenos with three
       different homemade sauces, a couple of awesome salads and one of
       our veteran altos brought a home-made tres leche cake which was to
       die for made with local eggs and cream. This cinco de mayo dinner
       is apparently a long-standing tradition. If we didn't have a lot of
       work to do winding up the choral season, we would have had
       margaritas or sangria to go with it but I had to put the breaks on
       that. We have a lot of big stuff coming up.

   I wonder why the very thought of physical therapy leaves me so down?
   They don't hurt me.  It's all balance.  Maybe it's their obvious panic
   over liability; I'm not allowed to stand up without a helper, and how
   do they imagine I got there? I walked across the street.

   Cheers to that sudden leap perennials make after a rainstorm, and to
   buds appearing overnight on all the roses.

   Jeers to the aphids that appeared overnight, too.  I handle them
   manually.  Yuck.

   Cheers to yesterday's smell 'n taste discoveries: lilacs yes!, yogurt
   (which I always hated) now tastes light and sweet, onions are nearly

       The Virgin Mobile store will help you get it set up and learn
       features. I always let my mobile pros give me a walk-through of a
       new phone. I use about 1 percent of what my Android can actually
       do, but aside from the fact that the battery life on those things
       is very short, I do love it. If for nothing else than for the
       grindr app. LOL.

       for "things you don't see every day."
       About a mile after leaving home this moring, a county sherriff
       pulls onto the road in front of me, switches on the lights, and
       stops.  Now I can't imagine anything I'd done wrong or any reason
       he'd have to stop me, so I stopped well behind him and waited to
       see what was up.
       That's when I saw the cow in the front yard.  A big ol' beef cow
       had apparently wandered loose from a nearby pasture and was
       standing there looking a bit confused at where he found himself.

       Cheers to the return of jbou!
       Cheers to civil unions in Colorado. Today's top front page of the
       Durango Herald has a story of two local(Bayfield, actually) women
       who were willingly & voluntarily 'sentenced to 99 to Life' with
       each other yesterday. Cheers Rita & Danielle!
       Cheers to snow in MN! I was just being nice the other day with the
       snow pic showing ~4" & saying it needed my snow shoe tracks. But
       shazam-I'm watching the Weather Channel, and you folks are getting
       hammered! 10" & still snowing? That REALLY calls out for snow
       shoes! Cheers, Minnesota-I am sooo envious. It's 26 here, going up
       to 60, full sun, no clouds today. I'd trade in a heartbeat.
       Cheers to all of you, but especially cheers to me--because good men
       are hard to find!  :)

       I'm happy we didn't get hit in the Twin Cities, especially since
       the snow is not very far away. A few miles farther north, and we
       would be dealing with that mess instead.

 He needed a time out ([2321]0+ / 0-)
       and he got one. I'm ok with that. But there was no way to know it
       was a time out & not a forever-y kinda banning. Or, not until kos
       posted a "ask me anything" diary & I asked.
       I enjoy reading him-he's exceptionally clever, but sometimes he
       loses me by going off the rails. Just a part of who he is I guess.

   Cheers to getting a job!  As a RN at a summer camp for developmentally
   and physically disabled kids and adults, mostly with autism and Down's
   syndrome.  I'm so excited!  It's at the foot of the mountains, and I'll
   live there, except on days off, and work 12-15 hour shifts.  There are
   a couple stretches of 10 days in a row, which will be hard.  There'll
   be one head nurse, two of us new grad RNs, and six nursing students.
   I'm not in it for the money, obviously, but for the experience, and
   they'll train us.  Was thinking the other day how I'm getting tired of
   working for free.  Was also told that my letters of recommendation
   sealed the deal, as four of us, out of fifteen applicants, were in the
   running.

   Hey, sfbob, you better get TrapperSF over to C&J, 'cuz we're getting
   hired! (Plus, cm needs his daily fix).

   Cheers to seeing old co-worker friends today.

   Cheers to going to Bodega Bay tomorrow for my b-day.  May I please have
   my caramels blessed today, Bill, as I won't be around tomorrow?  Cheers
   to the owner of the B&B going the extra mile by calling and asking
   about any dietary restrictions and offering to make reservations at
   restaurants.

   Sorry for your loss, Bill, but who names their washing machine???

   Cheers to Bill, Michael, Fantom, Haley, and all here.  Have a great

       ... that if he likes dusty old facts, documents with indecipherable
       handwriting, maybe a mystery or two, and history and historical and
       research trivia that genealogy can become an addicting hobby.
       First, get a good genealogy program  (THE best is Reunion which
       only works on Macs, but some people don't like Mac products).
       Second, never - but never, ever!!! - copy someone else's work.
       That's only copying someone else's work and it's not original
       research.  Down that path lies errors and mistakes that have to be
       corrected (and I loathe having to correct errors in a genealogy
       program, so attempt to be correct the first time).  If he finds
       something interesting in seeing someone else's info, fine...,
       pursue the trail to see if it's valid, but don't copy it as your
       own work.  Verify everything with documents.
       Always get copies of original documents when you can (that part
       gets expensive, but some areas have the oldest documents online,
       some even free - it just depends on which state it's in); some
       courthouse clerks are now clued into the fact that genealogists
       prefer good copies of original documents, not re-typed certified
       copies (they don't have blanks for everything; took me over a
       quarter of a century to find out one gr-grandmother died from
       measles at age 40 when a friend took a digital image of the old
       ledger book records used to be kept in and sent me the images;
       there was no open blank on the certified form to put in cause of
       death, just the other info), and since they have to notarize it to
       collect those huge fees, some can/will notarize the good photocopy
       instead of re-typing the info for a certified copy.  I always ask
       for a good photo copy.
       If great aunt once removed starts telling stories and everyone
       loves her stories, that's all very good and well, but for effect
       many details are "enhanced" through retelling and now the original
       may or may not be true, and some stories are half true but the time
       frame is all wrong and it happened a decade before or after the
       story you heard (I have had that happen, too).  Tape record or
       video tape her, make notes..., but don't enter the data in a genie
       program without backup documents (birth, marriage, death, census,
       land grants, draft registration info - whatever the case may be).
       I once wandered through a maze of the most amazing errors in an old
       woman's obit.  Turned out her kids didn't know her very well or
       never listened to stories when her hubby was alive, 'cuz the vast
       majority of the info in her obit was about her hubby; both were
       Norwegian immigrants from different areas of Norway and when one is
       working with patronymic names, it's important to find the father's
       first name.  I found their marriage info by accident in a different
       state, so Serendipity often plays a huge role in my finds of copies
       of original documents.
       When entering data, pretend you've time-traveled into the future,
       the documents worked with have become separated from the genealogy
       program..., and someone wants to re-create the data from original
       documents and info.  Type out every name in full, which means
       ALWAYS use a woman's birth surname for the initial entry.  Put
       nicknames or secondary names or name changes or note spelling
       errors in documents in the Notes section, and if there was a spouse
       for either male or female, the name change may - or may not - be
       assumed (some emigrants switched back and forth between a
       patronymic name and a location name until they finally settled on
       using one, and another one chose a different name on a whim.  I put
       my finds in chronological order from birth through death for my
       Source info and put it all in the Notes section.
       Use the European dating system (day, month, year) and spell it all
       out, never using numbers for the month or day and only the last two
       digits for the year (it's a hassle and one author of a book for one
       branch of my family used numbers for everything; he's dead, but
       some moments I could willingly go back and strangle him
       posthumously for using all those numbers and not spelling out the
       name of the month).  Never use abbreviations.  People in other
       countries won't know what they mean.  In 200 years a descendant
       won't know what the old abbreviations or acronyms mean.  Write all
       locations out in full (no abbreviations) by smallest to largest for
       all locations (city, township, county, state).
       If he gets stuck, kosmail me.  I keep irregular hours when I'm in
       the middle of a research project like I am now, but I'll see it at
       some point when I'm awake and online.  I might - or might not - be
       able to help.  Certain things in genealogy come naturally to me and
       I can find them in a very few minutes (I know "secrets" about
       certain cousins that are not generally known and I can't say
       anything, for instance, and they don't know that I know these
       things - I keep a second database offline for living descendants
       and private info so I don't accidentally put data about living
       people online - no reputable genealogist will put data about living
       people online).  For areas where I have no expertise, I might know
       someone who knows someone.
       Email lists can be good.  Message boards..., not so much, or
       they're only iffy.  I don't mess with message boards except for the
       ones gatewayed to email lists, and they're usually a pain in the
       ass.  I much prefer the world-wide email lists I'm on because the
       experienced researchers know what they're doing from long
       experience, so info they give about language, customs, records in
       their countries, etc., as well as the all-important translations
       and transcriptions of old handwriting are invaluable.  We turn
       around and help the newbies when we can and talk them through
       finding data or find it for them in their databases.
       I'm now into my 51st year of doing genealogy research....
       Eeeerrrrmmmm... did I mention genealogy research can be
       addictive...?
       Happy Ancestor Hunting!!!  :-)

       a diary.  Thanks for the advice.  Do you teach genealogy?  You'd be
       great.
       We do know that there was a samurai who lost his land, a great
       uncle who wrote bad checks and spent time in Leavenworth, a great
       grandmother who sold bootleg whiskey on skid row in L.A., and that
       my grandmother was possibly the product of a rape, but we need to
       get the details.  My brother was in Japan recently and looked
       through some public records but didn't turn up much.

 Yowza! ([2662]0+ / 0-)
       You do have an interesting family history in just what you do know!
        Makes me feel inadequate that I only turned up one murder mystery
       for the brother of one of my aunt's husband's brothers, but after
       reading the newspaper accounts printed before the alleged murderer
       committed suicide, I think the fellow's wife is the murderer and he
       probably only assisted.  When the 1940 census images came out last
       year I discovered the farm of the fellow murdered was next to where
       my aunt & uncle lived (both were my godparents six years later).
       The one (of several) areas of genealogy research about which I know
       next to nothing is Japanese research (any oriental country,
       actually).  I don't know what kind of records are available, and
       the languages are a mystery (other than they're an art form,
       elegant, and we saw some great photos of it with scenes of people
       or landscape along with the writing in my Art History classes).
       I don't teach genealogy, but I've been doing this so long and made
       enough mistakes of my own I had to correct, and learned enough from
       others, that I've got all the basics down pat for what is really
       necessary.
       I'd be a terrible teacher.  I have no patience.  I have had great
       teachers in my life and practically genuflect thinking about them
       to this day.  They fostered my independent learning processes even
       though they probably didn't realize they were doing so at the time,
       and before I had the vocabulary to label it.  My earliest student
       days were a bit unique in that I was the only kid in my grade from
       second through sixth grade, in a two-room school that had four
       grades in one room and two in the other.  When I entered seventh
       grade I had a lot of classmates in another school and we graduated
       together in 1964.
       Writing about genealogy basics and putting them in a DK post I've
       thought about doing, and I could branch off into research in the
       three Scandinavian countries where I find information all the time.
        I am a member of the DK genealogy and family history community.
       If I do post an article, I'll pimp it out probably in C&J and maybe
       in the PWB posts.
       Thanks for the encouragement!  :-)

   Locals are starting to realize we've been had.  Earlier water laws
   define southern New Mexico as part of the state of Texas in regard to
   Rio Grande water. This is not true for any other purpose, but because
   of that Texas feels entitled to our ground water as well, pointing out
   that it is really old Rio Grande water!  Since there is nothing but a
   trickle in the Rio, we may be shafted.  It is up to the Supreme Court
   of the U.S.  Why do I feel insecure?

   Jeers to loosing agriculture in the valley.  We are now seriously
   discussing the demise of pecan, chile pepper, cotton, alfalfa, and
   lettuce farming.  It has not yet come to that, but it could if the
   court rules against us.

   Jeers to the Republicans and a few Democrats in the U. S. Congress (I
   can't repeat this enough) - a bunch of privileged, subsidized,
   incompetent, crazy, and/or unprincipled, jerks.  We should pay them to
   not come to work, for what little they do is not in the best interest
   of the country.

   What was that about birth certificates and being born in a foreign

   Hmmmmmmm....

   CHEERS  I fell in love with [2946]Jon Stewart all over again last
   night.  He talked about the clusterfuck that is Guantanamo.  I never
   thought I'd see anything in American Moronic Media about Guantanamo.
   The day before that I read the story and saw the video on [2947]BBC's
   web site about Guantanamo and the failure to close it.  Then Jon had
   Kay Bailey Hutchison on, and talked about how the senate powers that be
   vowed not to pass any "bipartisan" legislation because it would make it
   seem like it was a "win" for Obama.  So much for "Mr. Bipartisan
   Compromise."  At this point, I feel confident in predicting that by the
   time Obama's second term is up, Guantanamo will still be open and none
   of the illegal and unconstitutional legislation that took our rights
   away will have been repealed.  $h!t.

   CHEERS  I also fell in love with [2948]Stephen Colbert all over again

   It's the House that votes today, but that's pro-forma. It was the
   Senate vote that really mattered. The Senate President apparently put
   aside her personal opposition to the bill to allow it to come to a
   vote. And the Catholic Church's opposition apparently doesn't count for
   as much as they thought it should.

   commenter on the article I read who first said "good for them because
   we need to get rid of the god idea" (I am WAY paraphrasing here, folks)
   ....and then blamed the continuing belief in god
   on....women????????????????????? (apparently because we refuse to not
   believe in god and teach our children bs). Yeah. So there's that.

   Jeers to the chlorine leak a couple miles down the road from my
   office...and jeers to no news about it. Just that it happened, but
   nothing else. I looked. Because really, any day that (clears throat) 5
   fire trucks, 1 "technological response unit," 1 rescue vehicle, 1 cop
   car and 3 unmarkeds race past your office window in a span of 15
   minutes (some have to come from farther off)....well, something's going
   on.

   Jeers to the parents who left their 7-year-old outside a bar while they
   had drinks. Dad told the cops that he told the kid to come in and play
   pool, but kid didn't want to, so "he's playing outside."

   The poll: really? The options are all about people that we'd have to
   see MORE of? Sorry. Couldn't vote. I haven't recovered from the last
   office Sarah Palin ran for. And Ted Cruz ratchets the crazy up past my
   tolerance level on a daily basis, so I try to ignore him.

   But overall, cheers to the crazies--it provides a nice point of
   contrast without my working too hard :-)

   had to comment on a couple of things that brought a big smile to my
   face: "RIP Kenny" and "And George W. will be lucky if he can convince
   anyone to name a one-holer at a rest stop after his sorry ass."
   Actually Kenny brought a smile while G.W. brought a hearty Laugh.
   Thanks again Bill.
