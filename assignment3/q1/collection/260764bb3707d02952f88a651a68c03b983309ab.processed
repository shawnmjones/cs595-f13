   Part religious retreat, part political rally, a wave of speakers stood
   on the west steps of the state Capitol on Friday to denounce a
   civil-unions bill winding through the legislature.

   They described the measure as "bigotry and hatred" because this year's
   version doesn't offer an exception for religious communities involved
   in adoption and such.

   Former House Republican leaders Frank McNulty and Amy Stephens --
   blamed by civil-union supporters for [21]blocking the passage of last
   year's bill -- spoke to the crowd, who cheered
   Connie and Tom Goodwin drove from Canon City to participate in the
   rally at the Capitol in Denver on jan. 25, 2013. (Lynn Bartels, The
   Denver Post)
   and waved pro-marriage signs.

   "It doesn't take courage to do the right thing," said McNulty, a
   Highlands Ranch Republican who had to hand over the speaker's gavel in
   January after Democrats regained control of the House after the
   November election.

   Stephens, the former majority leader, called civil-union supporters
   "cowards" for not taking the issue back to the voters. Coloradans in
   2006 defeated a civil-unions-like measure 52 percent to 48 percent.

   The Monument Republican praised Sen. Pat Steadman, a gay Denver
   Democrat who has introduced the bill for three straight years, as a
   "decent" man and urged opponents of civil unions to remember that in
   their battle.

   "We don't do it in hatred. We don't do it in anger. We'll do it because
   it's the right thing to do," she said.

   A number of the speakers, including radio host Dan Caplis and former
   Sen. Ed Jones of Colorado Springs, urged Gov. John Hickenlooper to act
   on his moderate credentials and veto the measure.

   The event was organized by the Colorado Catholic Conference, which had
   issued an invitation to those who support "traditional marriage -- the
   cornerstone of society."

   On a party-line vote, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday
   [22]approved the civil-unions bill, which now is headed to another
   committee, part of the many steps in the legislative process.

   With Democrats in control of the Senate, House and governor's office,
   [23]Senate Bill 11 is expected to be passed and signed into law,
   possibly as early as March.

   The bill gives same-sex couples many but not
