[22]Antonin Scalia develops split personality disorder

   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia speaks at a Reuters Newsmaker
   event in New York September 17, 2012. Scalia on Monday escalated a war
   of words with a prominent appeals court judge, saying the judge lied in
   a recent criticism of Scalia's judicial
   Justice Antonin Scalia
   Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is outraged--outraged--that the
   majority of the Court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act,
   [29]writing in his dissent that "We have no power under the
   Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation" and
   that the decision represents an "exalted notion of the role of this
   court in American democratic society." Because, don't you know, DOMA
   was passed by Congress democratically and therefore the Court should
   not touch it.

   One question: Where was this Scalia when the Supreme Court was deciding
   to gut the Voting Rights Act, which was renewed by Congress in 2006?

   Oh, that's right: Scalia was one of the justices gutting the VRA. That
   bill was passed in 2006 by a 390 to 33 vote in the House and 98 to zero
   in the Senate. By contrast, [30]DOMA was passed in 1996 by a 342 to 67
   vote in the House and 85 to 14 in the Senate. And public opinion has
   undergone a sea change since then. So the "We have no power under the
   Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation"
   argument applies far more to the VRA.

   But that's Scalia. His only consistency is in service of bigotry.

   [31]Please join us and call on Congress to finish the job that the
   Supreme Court started today. Sign the petition to pass The Respect For
   Marriage Act and support full marriage equality.

   [46]Tagging tips - [47]Search For Tags - [48]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       that Scalia is "principled" has persisted despite the myriad
       examples of him voting his political preference over his stated
       principles.  One would have thought Bush v. Gore would kill that
       notion forever, but no.

        Recommended by:
                [276]Satya1, [277]shenderson

       maybe the DK community should slow down a little bit and read what
       he actually said --

     This case is about power in several respects. It is about the power
     of our people to govern themselves, and the power of this Court to
     pronounce the law. Today's opinion aggrandizes the latter, with the
     predictable consequence of diminishing the former. We have no power
     to decide this case. And even if we did, we have no power under the
     Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation.
     The Court's errors on both points spring forth from the same
     diseased root: an exalted conception of the role of this institution
     in America.
     ....

     But wait, the reader wonders--Windsor won below, and so cured her
     injury, and the President was glad to see it. True, says the
     majority, but judicial review must march on regardless, lest we
     "undermine the clear dictate of the separation-of-powers principle
     that when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the
     Constitution, it is emphatically the province and duty of the
     judicial department to say what the law is.
     That is jaw-dropping. It is an assertion of judicial supremacy over
     the people's Representatives in Congress and the Executive. It
     envisions a Supreme Court standing (or rather enthroned) at the apex
     of government, empowered to decide all constitutional questions,
     always and every- where "primary" in its role.
     ....
     In other words, declaring the compatibility of state or federal laws
     with the Constitution is not only not the "primary role" of this
     Court, it is not a separate, free-standing role at all. We perform
     that role incidentally--by accident, as it were--when that is
     necessary to resolve the dispute before us. Then, and only then,
     does it become "`the province and duty of the judicial department to
     say what the law is.'"
     N.B. "Windsor won below" means in won in a lower court.
       So the guy is not making a stupid statement that indicates he
       doesn't know what his job is. He is applying sophisticated
       sophistry to arrive at the conclusion that the Court should not be
       deciding this case at all, that there was no injury to be remedied
       because the lower court found for Windsor, and the Government did
       not oppose that finding.

       Congress can still pass whatever legislation it wants. Conceivably
       a future Republican administration could try to enforce the law as
       written, and it would be necessary to sue them. Very doubtful that
       would happen, it seems to me.

       When I saw he voted to deny standing in the Prop 8 case, my first
       question was "why"?
       He may have seen that there was a 5 vote majority not just to
       overturn Prop 8, but potentially to rule even more expansively (by
       issuing a "Loving"-style decision, or overturn all anti-gay
       referenda).
       If he saw that as a potential outcome, he would do everything and
       anything to prevent SCOTUS from issuing a decision in the case -
       including cynically voting to deny standing.
       I really doubt it had anything to do with his "principled nature",
       or even an effort to fluff the "myth of his principled nature" -
       I'm far more inclined to believe it was all about his vote count
       and attempting to manipulate the process to get the result he
       wanted.
       My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear.

   A young Jewish man in Moscow, hoping to go along to get along, did his
   best to act the part of the good Communist. However, he just couldn't
   wrap his head around some of the ideology. Finally, he discreetly
   consulted his rabbi to see if he cold clarify the notion of
   "dialectical materialism".

   The rabbi said, "I will illustrate with a parable. Moshe and Aaron
   climb down a chimney. Moshe is covered with soot, but Aaron somehow
   manages to keep himself clean. Which of them washes himself?"

   "Moshe, of course!"

   The rabbi shook his head. "No -- Aaron washes himself. He sees Moshe
   standing in front of him dirty, and assumes that he must have gotten
   dirty, while Moshe sees Aaron standing in front of him clean, and
   assumes that he must also be clean. Now... Moshe and Aaron climb down a
   chimney. Moshe is covered with soot, but Aaron somehow manages to keep
   himself clean. Which of them washes himself?"

   "That's the same question you just asked! Aaron washes himself.

   "No -- Aaron and Moshe each look at his own hands, and Aaron sees clean
   hands while Moshe sees dirty ones. Now... Moshe and Aaron climb down a
   chimney. Moshe is covered with soot, but Aaron somehow manages to keep
   himself clean. Which of them washes himself?"

   The young man stares at the rabbi for a moment, then exclaims, "You're
   just making things up so the answer will come out the way you want!"

   The rabbi smiled. "Now, young man, you understand this 'dialectical
   materialism'."

       Once upon a time in his career as a Supreme Court Justice Antonin
       Scalia would have written to overturn DOMA. Not because he was in
       favor of gay marriage, but because he would have found no
       constitutional basis for it.
       You can still see glimmers of that guy in his opinions concerning
       the Fourth Amendment.
       That guy was a hero of mine -- not because I agreed with him all
       the time (I didn't) but because I believed with every opinion he
       wrote that he was putting the Constitution ahead of personal
       opinion. He had a reputation as a conservative but also a
       reputation of breaking with them in a moment's notice if he thought
       conservatives were violating the constitution.
       I know y'all don't believe it, but he had that reputation, once
       upon a time -- and once upon a time he deserved it. He's pretty
       much pissed it away now.

       If we are talking about Federal elections why do the States get to

       Seems to me that for Federal elections Federal rules apply equally
       and everywhere. State officials simply implement those rules.
       I recommend a 24 hour voting day. No results can be reported
       anywhere until the Federal voting day ends.
       All polling places must be open 6am to 8pm local time.
       Wait times to vote over 1 hour get all elected state officials' pay
       docked $1 per minute per person affected. The number of polling
       places in the state is proportional to population. The number of
       voters served per polling place may not vary by more than 100%
       between the polling place with the most voters and the one with the
       least voters (possibly with narrowly circumscribed exceptions for
       distant... there's a lot of open space in say... Montana)

       when you see big complaints in the last election come out of places
       like Ohio and Philadelphia. It does have a little luck of punishing

       The thing that really seems questionable about the latest renewal

       was the length of the extension. 25 years.  That's a long time to

        Recommended by:
                [780]dinotrac, [781]Berkeley Fred

       1. This Congress will not legislate a new formula for the one the
       Court decided was so dated. The 18 Senators in those nine target
       states (plus several more states where a jurisdiction, usually a
       county, smaller than a state is under the re-clearance requirement)
       will not - not ever! Never! - allow a re-creation of that process.
       This GOP House will not tolerate reenacting the VRA.
       2. There is zero likelihood that Congress would put a preclearance
       VRA requirement on all states. Why? Because that would be
       tantamount to erasing state jurisdiction over qualifications to
       vote, in favor of a Federal override and at the front end, before
       the restrictions could become effective. The Court acknowledged the
       difficult truth that except in a few specific instances (such as
       defining who is a "citizen," the 18 years threshold, etc.), the
       Constitution gives the states almost all power. They ain't gonna
       give that up.
       3. It is true that voting matters can be jiggered in Oh, so many
       ways, and are by other states than the targeted nine. But that
       throws the baby out with the bath water. The way that the Feds get
       involved at all - given so much state power to decide
       qualifications, mess with voting hours and locations, etc. - is
       because states typically disadvantage groups, such as people of
       color, who are protected by Federal law. Those state-legislated
       disadvantages do not limit likely Republican voters.
       What will happen now is that restrictive laws on registration,
       voter ID, election processes (polling location and hours, process,
       advance vetting, etc.) and the many other ways to screw those who
       want to vote will get challenged all right, but there's no
       pre-clearance. As it has been said, the wheels of justice will
       grind exceedingly slow and exceedingly fine.
       Moreover, a state legislature and/or local and county election
       officials might - just might; I'm only sayin' "might" - wait until
       the last minute to act, leaving very little time for challengers to
       get to court. Moreover, in the process, they'll obliterate the
       previous ways of doing things (records, defunding or
       disenfranchising election boards, etc.) so even if a court were to
       enjoin the new restrictions, it would be too late.
       The VRS decision is another case, like Citizens United, where the
       judges can say they had no such intent. To say their ruling - as
       such - had no such effect. To lament the human condition and break
       for coffee.
       We'll see.

 Only if you believe racism no longer exists ([785]0+ / 0-)
       The only way Roberts' legal argument has any validity is if the
       facts are conclusive that racism does not exist at all in any of
       the jurisdictions covered by Section 4. Prove that by a
       preponderance of the evidence (at minimum), and then maybe the
       argument of the preclearance map being 'unfair' might make sense.
       Does anyone to the left of the KKK believe that racism does not
       exist in America today? Gee, if Roberts et al were correct, why
       there would not be any actions by local and state governments to
       restrict voting, because after all, there no longer is any more
       racist reason to do so. Wait a minute, what was enacted in Texas?
       North Carolina, literally hours after the decision? Are these laws
       designed to make it easier to vote? No? But I don't understand, if
       there's no more racism, what is the reason for these actions?
       Anyone? Anyone? Buehler?
       For the KRATS, never ascribe stupidity when you can ascribe malice
       to their actions. Of course they knew that this would be the
       outcome. It's what they wanted. It's what too many Americans want -
       to 'move on' from all that icky racist past. Interesting how often
       they and their supporters insist there must be a deadline after
       which we can say the past no longer matters.
       'Let Congress decide.' Yeah, I'm sure they can't count the number
       of reps of each party in the House, either.
       They can count just like we can, they read the papers just like we
       do: they can see that American politics is polarized between the
       White Christian Party and the Everyone Else Party, and the numbers
       are pointing one way: the wrong way.

       There was a round of court decisions regarding tests that

       It's ok to screen out minority candidates if your screening test
       actually reflects the skills needed to do the job, but, if it
       knocks out minorities for reasons that don't relate to the job, you
       can't use it.
       A couple of ways around the problem:
       1. Apply pre-clearance across the board, or
       2. Clarify the requirements for pre-clearance.

 No, it's not. ([806]0+ / 0-)
       But -- If you are going to bring the machinery and might of the
       federal government into play (making the resources used unavailable
       elsewhere), you should have a good reason for doing it, or more
       accurately, a supporatable reason for doing it.
       Remember MB's diary about the effect of the law on Indian
       reservations? The ACLU examined more than 600 laws (or maybe they
       were just regulations, I don't recall) and found that about 600
       were unobjectionable and something like 11 were a problem.
       If that's a pre-clearance district, the government needs to go
       through all 600+ regulations. And that's ok if there's good reason
       to be believe the locals are going to sneak in those 11 bad
       actions.  It means work for the feds, and it means gumming up the
       works for the locals. It's a high price, but --- when the locals
       can't be trusted, it's a price that must be paid.
       If there is no good reason to believe that locals can't be trusted,
       the price may be too high to pay, especially when you realize that
       the absence of pre-clearance is not the absence of remedy.  Look
       again at the example MB cited. Lakota were not in a pre-clearance
       district, but the ACLU sued and won, making the case that
       pre-clearance was justified.

   and he's still a political hack today.

   He was sent to the court by Reagan to preside over the destruction of
   the civil rights legislation enacted by Democrats.

   The disgrace is this "cafone" was unanimously confirmed by the US
   Senate.

   The court is no place for those so far out of the mainstream.  It's
   about time the Senate exercised it's role to "advise and consent".
   Which doesn't mean roll over and play dead for any president.

   with Hendrix.  Bloomfield was apparently a very competitive guitar
   player, for a while he was one of the best.  He was totally blown away
   by what Hendrix was doing and just couldn't deal with it ego-wise.

   He was also frustrated by the success of Super Sessions which was a one
   day jam Kooper pulled together compared to compared to his Electric
   Flag album he'd worked on meticulously for months.

   He was absolutely a great guitarist but he had some issues.  One more

       But my previous comment stands.  The Youtube series and the

       When I found those two resources, I ate them up.  Bloomfield was
       such an influence but he seemed to just disappear, there were a
       bunch of rumors and these sites cleared them up.  I knew both Al
       Cooper and Elvin Bishop back in the mid 70's (job related) but I
       never thought to ask them about Bloomfield, I wish I had.
       We had some really wonderful music back then, didn't we.

   as he shape-shifts to camouflage his true, constant, core personality.

   But later you pinned Scalia to the wax:  his constancy is bigotry.

   Bigotry, though, is a kind of base mob rule.  Roberts constancy is,
   imho, the more dangerous, both for his comparative youth and his higher
   position.  His constancy is anti-democratic.

   Scalia's bigotry is of "the other".  He incises a circle that excludes
   them, and defends it by parsing who gets to be included.  Robert's
   bigotry is any other.  His circle encompasses only himself.

     The rulings came 10 years to the day after the court's Lawrence v.
     Texas decision that struck down state bans on gay sex. In his
     dissent at the time, Scalia predicted the ruling would lead to
     same-sex marriage.
       (from Yahoo News article)
       So the fact that it is 10-years to the day and that he predicted
       Lawrence would lead to marriage equality makes him a winner, right?
       (he meant it back then as a bad thing)  Or is it a bigger loser, a

 How is it nonresponsive? ([1385]0+ / 0-)
       In New Hampshire, you can get married at 13. If Congress passed a
       law denying recognition to marriages entered into under the age of
       15, it would be treating some legally married couples in one state
       differently than legally married couples in other states.
       Similarly, if Rhode Island passed a law saying that it wouldn't
       recognize any marriage entered into by someone under the age of 15,
       a couple who married at the age of 13 in NH that moved to RI would
       find that their marriage was no longer recognized. (And please
       don't tell me Full Faith and Credit says otherwise--states have
       always had the prerogative to refuse to recognize marriages that
       are contrary to their public policy.)
       Because federal law, for the most part, incorporates the marriage
       laws of the state of residence, couples who legally married at 13
       in NH would be treated as married by the federal government (for
       most purposes) if they stay in NH, but wouldn't be treated as
       married if they moved to RI. That's current law, and I don't see
       how it violates equal protection.

   Antonin Scalia is the worst type of false intellectual there is.

   He already thinks that by talking a lot and using long words and
   occasional flashes of "wit", he achieves importance and power.

   But to sit up on his fat hairy ass and read his dissenting opinion--
   which boils down to "Ba ba waaaah, the Vatican told me to put the icky
   homos in jail and you won't let me, you're all stupid doody heads, waah
   waah waaaah"-- is the height of assholish pseudointellectualism and
   elitism.

 A VERY juvenile dissenting opinion ([1428]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1429]Josiah Bartlett

   In its tone, Scalia's work is incredible.  Very juvenile and  immature.
    Not the stuff from the highest court in the land. Sarcasm with heavy
   tones of Tea Party outrage.  Heck, I write simple business
   correspondence over a controversial topic with far more respect than he
   shows for the majority opinion.

   Some excerpts (Scalia's emphasis preserved):

     (some Tea Party rhetoric and without irony about conservative
     intrusions into private lives)
     The Court is eager--hungry--to tell everyone its view of the legal
     question at the heart of this case. Standing in the way is an
     obstacle, a technicality of little interest to anyone but the people
     of We the People, who created it as  a barrier against judges'
     intrusion into their lives.
     ...

     (fake dialogue)
     But wait, the reader wonders--Windsor won  below, and so cured her
     injury, and the President was glad  to see it.  True, says the
     majority,....
     ...

     (more angry hyperbole)
     That is jaw-dropping.  ... It envisions a Supreme Court standing (or
     rather enthroned) at the apex of government, ...
     ...
     (a sample of the many doses non-intellectual sniping and sarcasm)
     The authorities the majority cites fall miles short...
     ...
     (so much angry, disrespectful snarkism)
     As I have said, the  real rationale of today's opinion, whatever
     disappearing  trail of its legalistic argle-bargle one chooses to
     follow....

   Finally, I think the following attack on the majority explains his own
   clouded thinking.  His attack explains his own angry screed.

     It is hard to admit that one's political opponents are not monsters,
     especially in a struggle like this one, and the challenge in the end
     proves more than today's Court [Scalia!] can handle.  Too bad.  A
     reminder that disagreement over something so fundamental as marriage
     can still be politically legitimate would have been a fit task for
     what in earlier times was called the judicial temperament.

   And Scalia's screed in the permanent record fully demonstrates his own
   lack of judicial temperament.  Even if he was a simple mediator, I
   would never engage him to help settle a matter.   He obviously can't
   keep his cool and lets his personal biases contaminate his temperament.

 Scalia is a dangerous rightist who gives good text ([1449]0+ / 0-)

   The man is famous for writing about originalism and state's rights.

   Legal scholars on the liberal progressive side -LOVE- him as the
   supreme intellectual on the Court and in law schools cart him out as
   the model for how one should think about and frame the issues.

   And then react in shock everytime they lose a case somewhere... after
   spending years in law schools training their people on how to lose to
   him and his people...

   The truth is he's only about Originalism when that fits his definition
   of hateful bigotry.

   He only cares for states rights when its the rights of Segregationist
   minded states...

   He will flip his logic on a dime in order to support bigotry,
   corporatocracy (spelling if any?), white-power, male-power,
   wealth-power, established-christian-power, and so on.

   Suddenly he will become a champion of Congress and the Federal
   government, if its used to shut down 'brown people', 'poor folks',
   'workers', 'middle class', 'women', 'equality', 'environment',
   'science', 'non-christians', 'progressive-christians', etc...

   If you read him, in isolation each argument is very well written. But
   often has gaping logic flaws that somehow progressive legal scholars
   will gloss over in their flowing devotion to him.

   He's a radical. He gives good argument, but he has no actual mental
   substance to it. And the things he advocates are outright dangerous
   notions.

   Conservative legal scholars don't bother to prop him up - no need to
   prop up your greatest fly-trap when the flies on the other side do it
   for you.

   He seriously needs to go... but he's going to be one of those guys
   they'll be wheeling into the Courtroom when he's 103...

   Liberal justices like to retire way too often. Conservatives ones like
   him refuse to budge until you carry them out.
