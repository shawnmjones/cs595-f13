   Paul Katami (R) shares a kiss after proposing marriage to Jeff Zarrillo
   (L) as the two plaintiffs in the case against California's gay marriage
   ban known as Prop 8 address reporters outside the Supreme Court in
   Washington, June 26, 2013. &nbsp;REUTERS/Jonathan
   Wedding bells for Paul Katami (R) and Jeff Zarrillo (L), the two
   plaintiffs in the case against California's gay marriage ban known as
   Prop 8?
   Some good news for a Friday evening, via [30]Reuters:

     Gay marriage can resume immediately in California after an appeals
     court on Friday lifted an injunction preventing the unions.

     "The stay in the above matter is dissolved effective immediately,"
     the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling.

   I want to hear back on how many of you took the plunge on Monday, mind
   you.

   Be sure to check out the celebrating going on in [31]jpmasser's

   [32]4:38 PM PT: woot!
   [33][ff043b3b9c30c2462ab89edecbf75a7e_normal.jpeg] Same-sex marriage is
   now the law in California! #prop8
   -- [34]@JerryBrownGov

   [35]5:37 PM PT: And awesome, glorious news from [36]Berkeleyside:

     Prop. 8 plaintiffs and Berkeley couple Kris Perry and Sandy Stier
     were married this afternoon by Attorney General Kamala Harris at San
     Francisco City Hall. The wedding took place shortly after the 9th
     U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted a stay on the 2010 lower-court
     ruling that would clear the way for same-sex marriages, to begin
     immediately throughout California.

     Perry and  Stier were at the head of the line that formed at San
     Francisco City Hall to obtain marriage licenses and Harris rushed to
     City Hall to perform the first marriage. According to media,
     including KQED News and the Los Angeles Times, the couple were the
     first same-sex marriage in California since 2008.

   Congrats to the great, brave, fighting couple!

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [52]Tagging tips - [53]Search For Tags - [54]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   I'll probably keep working hard here in NC to bring about real equality
   in our recently hard right wing State.  It'll be good for the losers to
   lose again.  Smirks to tears?  That's a motivation in itself, due to
   their glee in hurting anyone they damn well want to.

   My girlfriend said I can't get gay married anyway, so I might as well
   just keep fighting for anyone that chooses to do so and is allowed to
   do so by their girlfriend / boyfriend.

   Love is all that matters

   Someone once asked me why do you always insist on taking the hard road?

   Back in NYC [246]someone I supported was one of the first judges in NY
   to marry gay couples. Sadly, she lost her next election to the corrupt
   machine, but at least she was there when NY made history. And, in fact,
   performed a marriage ceremony for two lesbian friends of mine...all
   three were in tears.

   is still in the dark ages. We will need court action here, but it
   cannot continue that you can be gay married with federal benefits in
   NY, and then move to Philly and lose them all.....including your status
   as married. Irrational. Certainly ultimately unconstitutional.

       It's just going to take one of the cases currently in the federal
       pipeline to get to the SCOTUS, where as Scalia feared, they can
       just quote this opinion and be done with it once and for all.
       Full faith and credit anyone?  The incorporation doctrine?
       If animosity was insufficient grounds for DOMA on a federal level
       on the basis of the 5th amendment, then it's also clearly an
       unconstitutional action when a state does it because he 14th
       amendment says the 5th applies to states.
       Viola.  The entire legal rationale for striking down all state bans
       on same-sex marriage in just one run-on sentence!

 How much does it cost tio get gay married ([365]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [366]TrueBlueMajority

   in California?

   I don't want to get gay married (or any married, really, right now),
   but I think it would be nice if we could start a coupon program for
   this.  Redeemable FREE GAY MARRIAGE COUPONS.  I don't have much money
   but if I can cough up $10 for wikileaks, I could throw a few dollars
   towards that.

   We could have a website for it too.  A place where you can print out
   the coupon like the postal service does.  It might even be paid for
   with pro-marriage advertising, too.  Maybe it could even be
   self-financing that way.

   Somebody with more energy -- run with it!
