AG Holder to fight Texas on voting rights

   Associated Press

   In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the Voting Rights
   Act, Republican policymakers acted with remarkable speed -- literally,
   less than 24 hours -- to approve new voting restrictions, most notably
   a controversial voter-ID law.

   When the Voting Rights Act was intact, changes to voting laws in the
   Lone Star State would need to be cleared with the Justice Department in
   advance of being implemented, but with the law gutted by a narrow
   Supreme Court majority, GOP officials in Texas assumed the Justice
   Department is no longer relevant, and they could do as they pleased.

   The nation's Attorney General apparently [3]believes otherwise.

     Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in late June that weakened the
     Voting Rights Act, Attorney General Eric Holder says the Justice
     Department will use what's left of the law to go after what it
     considers discriminatory practices.

     And the first target will be Texas, in a dispute over new boundaries
     drawn by the Republican legislature for congressional and
     legislative districts.

     Holder told National Urban League this morning that the Justice
     Department's Civil Rights division will urge a federal judge in
     Texas to subject the State of Texas to a pre-clearance regime
     similar to the one required by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act --
     a part of the law that survived the Supreme Court's ruling.

   It's not that Holder is ignoring the Supreme Court's ruling; it's that
   Holder believes the ruling still leaves him some room to maneuver. "We
   believe that the State of Texas should be required to go through a
   pre-clearance process whenever it changes its voting laws and
   practices," the A.G. said.

   What's the basis for this? We'll know more as the process unfolds, but
   it appears that the Justice Department believes that under the
   remaining provisions of the VRA, when "intentional voting
   discrimination" is found, these changes to voting rights cannot be
   permitted to continue.

   And because Texas' voter-ID law is very likely predicated on
   discriminatory grounds, Holder wants a federal court to intervene now
   -- before voter suppression can begin.

   As the Austin Statesman [4]reported this morning, the Justice
   Department's move "marks the first federal action connected to voting
   rights" since the Supreme Court's ruling, though as Holder added this
   morning, "It will not be our last."

   So, does the case have a credible shot?
     __________________________________________________________________

   The A.G. probably wouldn't be pushing this if he didn't think he has a
   reasonable chance of success, and as Ian Millhiser [5]noted, Texas'
   efforts at voter suppression are very familiar to Holder and his team.

     As Holder notes in his remarks, Texas is a particularly strong
     candidate for such federal supervison due to "the [6]evidence of
     intentional racial discrimination" in Texas that the Justice
     Department presented to a federal court last year. Among other
     things, this federal court found that Texas Republicans charged with
     drawing the states' legislative maps "consciously replaced many of
     [a] district's active Hispanic voters with low-turnout Hispanic
     voters [7]in an effort to strengthen the voting power of [the
     district's] Anglo citizens. In other words, they sought to reduce
     Hispanic voters' ability to elect" a candidate of their choice.

   It's safe to say voter-suppression proponents in other states -- cough,
   [8]North Carolina, cough -- will be keenly interested in the outcome of
   this case.

   The eternal optimist in me hopes that the gutting of the Voting Rights'
   Act might be a blessing in disguise - it will show the state
   governments that want to suppress the right to vote for the racist
   Machiavellian douche nozzles that they are and will serve to strengthen
   the act...

   But hey, may as well wish for a pony while I'm at it. I may be an
   optimist, but I'm not crazy.

   Only section 4(b) of the VRA was deemed unconstitutional. That's the
   formula that, based on outdated criteria, subjected the Southern states
   to preclearance. Section 3(c), which was not deemed unconstitutional,
   allows Justice to subject any jurisdiction to preclearance based on a
   set of criteria that does not single out any geographical area. 3(c)
   could be used to go after Ohio, Florida, etc. who were not subject to
   preclearance before, but I can't find the full text of it and thus
   don't know what the criteria are and I also can't figure out how it has
   been enforced in the past.

   Will the backlash be taken advantage of? Voter id laws will impact part
   of the GOP base (elderly voters), so what if progressive groups used
   the outrage mobilize the funding and grassroots organizing needed to
   get Voter IDs for the bulk of its base?

   Is there a groundswell of progressive NGOs going after this jugular?

   No.

   The response is scattered- groups like Tennessee Citizen Action, League
   of Women Voters and 9to5 Milwaukee are conducting outreach campaigns to
   drive acquisition of voter id, but the dollars are not flowing to the
   grassroots organizations, but to traditional media oriented political
   campaign organizations.

   Let's face it, grassroots organizing is not where the huge budgets, the
   glory and the highly paid jobs are. Sure there are organizers who do
   the right thing, but most of them can't sustain their efforts, or they
   have to resume their university studies so they can complete their
   degrees.

   So I would have thought the organizer who became President would
   recognize this and do something other than treat this as a law problem
   and throw his AG at it. Maybe part of the problem is that it was not an
   organizer who became president, but yet another lawyer who became
   president. That's not a cut at the President, but a challenge for him
   to rise to be the person he could be.

   Organizing for Action could be doing something substantial and
   nationwide, but it is comatose- MIA since 2012.

   Just like in 2008, but I am optimistic- it could be different this
   time. I still have Hope.

   As you aptly point out, money dictates what organized action can be
   taken. Making these laws hasn't cost Texas Republicans money and they
   are unlikely to lose the big campaign supporters. The few elected
   democratic officials we have in Texas already have an uphill battle to
   get reelected, without having to spend campaign money on fighting voter
   discrimination.

   But it is also labor/time intensive. Getting the voter to the DMV or
   courhouse, making sure they have the necessary documentation and so on.

   Money solicitations and automatic email programs don't deliver then
   necessary political muscle.

   It needs people donating their time and patience for a cause.

   I get lots of emails soliciting donations for signing petitions. That
   is not going to cut it. Money is going to have come from others, which
   should be a concern. I don't have money (please stop asking, I don't
   have any), but I can register voters.

   I have hope that people will take notice of the money in elections and
   politics is something from which to recoil and suspect.

   Right now, we are trying to fight fire with fire because we think that
   is working. I hope that is again proven not so effective as getting
   people eager to register to vote and willing to do what it takes to
   vote.

   Informing themselves on all the candidates and issues, resist random
   voting for a name they saw on many ads or signs.

   Resist skipping over the House and Senate candidates. Pay attention to
   what they do, not just what they say.

   Resist an idea that we need to vote in a different party than the
   president for balance. This is what happened, no cooperation.

   No cooperation means the President doesn't get the agenda that was his
   and our reasons for electing that President.

   NC's law isn't on the books yet, that's why. As soon as it is, with all
   the 'kitchen sink' stuff the far right threw into the bill, there's no
   doubt going to be several items in the final bill that will be
   applicable to the VRA.

   I wonder if the pols in NC are noting this at all. Likely they don't

   They are using Texas as a test case since the practices they are trying
   to put into law were already declared discriminatory by the Federal
   court that will hear the case, if I recall correctly.

   The Supreme court already said they didn't like the formula that was
   working, and wanted a case by case basis for "pre-clearance". Now that
   they'll get one where discrimination has been determined, it will be
   interesting to see how they wiggle their way out...

   Require that a gun deal carry insurance for the deaths caused by any

   The Supreme Court did not "gut" the voting rights act by ruling against
   the areas that the law covered. It said that Congress should up-date
   that part of the law.

   On the night that he was re-elected, President Obama said that he was
   going to fix the problems that surrounded voting in the 2012 election.
   Fixing any major problem is not like buying food at a fast-food
   restaurant. It take time especially when the Koch Republicans in the
   House and in Koch Republican controlled legislatures in 25 states are
   determined to violate the basic rights of millions and millions of
   Americans and not just the voting rights of Americans.

   Dogjudge says, "If LBJ or JFK were in office, they would have gone
   after all of them in a hearbeat." Sadly, Dogjudge, LBJ got the Civil
   Rights Act passed in the aftermath of JFK's assassination. There is
   doubt that JFK would have gotten it passed. Besides, a successful

   What the Republicans are continuing to do to such a great state brings
   tears and rage to me. How can Texas be such a wonderful place on one
   hand and such a hateful, fearful, bigoted, prejudiced place on the
   other hand? And they claim to be a righteous, religious state. Yet they
   spew hate and judgement to many because of race & all else they fear!
   Christ was asked, "Lord, of all the Commandments, which is the most
   important to follow?" Christ answered, "There are two." So Jesus
   explains that, "The first is to love God supremely, "And the second is
   like unto it, You shall love your neighbour as thyself." ~Matthew 22:39
   For a state in the 'Bible-belt' you'd think that they could at least
   follow these two!
   Shame on the haters of Texas. You make all of the people of Texas look
   as ignorant as y'all are. One of the reasons I left, I couldn't stand
   all the hate from 'certain groups' that soil the entire name of the
   state!

   I've never felt that just because some states were known to have
   engaged in voter suppression shenanigans means they should be singled
   out for scrutiny on voting laws. Frankly I think every state should
   have to receive approval before making modifications-otherwise we run
   the risk of the unsupervised states running amok.

   Yes, but taking away a law is taking a way an umbrella while it's
   raining.

   Let's work on something that stops the rain from getting us all soaked
   first, then take away the umbrella.

   This was old certain states known for their Jim Crow, well we now know
   Jim Crow doesn't stop at the state lines.

   Pennsylvania and Ohio were not part of the Confederacy, but they both
   tried to limit voting last election.

   That's not the only reason 'magnoliagirl', TX has been doing all kinds
   of strange law changes that only hurt the minorities of the state. Some
   examples are: women's rights, LGBT rights, people of color, people in
   their state with 'green cards' to work, etc....
   They had a Rep.Governor Candidate, Clayton Williams. He compared the
   cold, foggy weather spoiling this outdoor event to rape, telling ranch
   hands, campaign workers and reporters all around a campfire, ''If it's
   inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.''
   So you see, they have a bit of a history of this behavior and not
   thinking there's anything wrong with it. He even thought he was being
   funny! Ann Richards-D won as Governor that election! She got the
   lottery, had the budget balanced for the entire state and they don't
   even have State Income Tax.
   The following election she was up against Daddy Bush's boy & even
   though he tried to go dove hunting to get 'press' because reporters
   were following Ann while she hunted (as she did each year) he went out
   and shot up into a group of birds and killed an endangered species.
   Dumb ass! He still won and went on to be a President. He sucked as a
   Gov., why would people think he'd be a good Pres.?

   It may be that the SC will get another chance to look at voting rights.
   Any challenge to laws in Texas, North Carolina, or any other state
   trying to suppress votes is likely to make its way there very soon.

   Here's hoping the DOJ puts forth a good case and wins. Regardless of
   the outcome, I hope they are also working on a case against [DEL: North
   :DEL] Nazi Carolina (apologies to my friends who actually have the bad
   fortune to live there)

   I'm sorry, but it's getting so bad that, when I see a grouping of old
   white male politicians in front of a microphone, I cringe and my
   stomach starts hurting.

   The game is now, "How much worse can it get?".

   And the Cons are working ever so hard to answer that question every day
   in every possible way.
