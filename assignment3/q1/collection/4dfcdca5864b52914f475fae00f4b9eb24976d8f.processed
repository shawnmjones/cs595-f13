[22]National Review: Birthers are bipartisan

   Texas Senate candidate Ted Cruz speaking at the Values Voters Summit
   Ted Cruz poses a dilemma for birthers: If they admit he's a
   natural-born citizen, they have to give up their precious Obama
   conspiracy--or possibly invent a new one
   I think Eliana Johnson of National Review intended [29]this as an
   effort to wash the conservative movement's hands of birthers by
   labeling them as bipartisan, but it actually does a pretty good job of
   exactly the opposite:

     Birthers, it turns out, can be bipartisan. They have a new target --
     the rapidly rising GOP senator Ted Cruz.

     Though he bears all the marks of a Texan -- the swagger, the
     signature twang, and the ever-present cowboy boots -- 42-year-old
     Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, to an American mother and a Cuban
     father. By dint of his mother's citizenship, Cruz was an American
     citizen at birth. Whether he meets the Constitution's requirement
     that the president of the United States be a "natural-born citizen,"
     a term the Framers didn't define and for which the nation's courts
     have yet to offer an interpretation, has become the subject of
     considerable speculation.

   Despite initially saying that Calgary Cruz's eligibility is an open
   question, Johnson eventually makes it clear that every serious legal
   scholar thinks this speculation is idiotic. The reason for that is
   simple: U.S. law [30]clearly defines Cruz as a citizen from birth
   thanks to his mother's citizenship and there's no chance a court or any
   other branch of government would interpret this as anything other than
   Cruz being a natural-born citizen who is eligible for the presidency.

   Nonetheless, as Johnson documents, there are plenty of people who don't
   realize this, including Ann Coulter and Carl Cameron--both of whom have
   said Cruz is ineligible--and Donald Trump, who hasn't made up his mind.
   (Coulter later corrected herself.) Moreover, many of the same
   anti-Obama birther conspiracy sites refuse to accept that Cruz is a
   natural-born citizen.

   Notice that there aren't any progressive or Democratic birthers on
   Johnson's list. True, Cruz is a Republican and President Barack Obama
   is a Democrat, but this doesn't mean that birthers are bipartisan. What
   it means is that some birthers are trying to be consistent, because if
   birthers were to accept Cruz as a natural-born citizen, they'd also
   have to accept Obama as one, because they both had American-born
   mothers.

   For a birther to simultaneously say that Cruz is eligible but that
   Obama is not, saying the president was born in Kenya wouldn't be
   enough. They'd also have to say his mother wasn't his mother. I'm sure
   there's some of them who go that far, but for most birthers, the real
   problem with acknowledging that Cruz is eligible is that they'd also
   have to acknowledge Obama is eligible.

   My first choice would be for this whole birther thing to just go away.
   It's clear as day that Ted Cruz is constitutionally eligible to be
   president and birthers are insane to suggest otherwise. But I have to
   admit, if birthers end up taking down Cruz just because it's the only
   way they can hang onto their Obama conspiracy theory, it would be
   pretty damn hilarious. So until they get a grip on reality, I'm going
   to happily keep on calling him Calgary Cruz.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [44]Civil
   Rights, [45]Community, [46]Congress, [47]Culture, [48]Economy,
   [49]Education, [50]Elections, [51]Energy, [52]Environment, [53]Health

   [59]National Security, [60]Science, [61]Transportation, or [62]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([63]California, [64]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       McCain was allegedly born on a military base in Panama.  We really
       don't have any proof of this because no one has asked for his long
       form birth certificate or traveled to Panama to prove he was born
       on the military base and not in Panama general.  To rational
       people, because at least one his parents was American, the question
       is moot.  For me, I would have demanded that McCain undergo a
       paternity test.  For all we know his real father is Ricaurte(?)
       Noriega and he is Manuel's half brother.  We don't even know if
       Roberta is his mother.  He might have been just some kid they found
       on the street.  I don't know why the wingnuts did not mount an
       investigation.  We might have some wetback as president, then where
       would we be?

   McCain was born on a navy base in the Canal Zone (at that time
   belonging to the U.S., so it was U.S. soil)  to naval a U.S.

 On being born in the Canal Zone ([261]3+ / 0-)

       John McCain has a couple of ways to claim being a U.S. citizen by
       birth, but neither has to do with being born in the Panama Canal
       Zone or on a Navy base.
       An American military base is not American soil. If it were, then
       any baby born on the base would be a citizen by birth. They are
       not. The baby needs an American parent or two to become a citizen.
       Do some googling on the State Department, U.S. citizenship, and
       military bases abroad. The State Department has helpfully explained
       which infants born on American bases abroad get U.S. passports and
       which don't.
       The Panama Canal Zone was an unincorporated and unorganized
       American territory. It was not "American soil" that counted for
       transmission of citizenship.
       Babies born in the Panama Canal Zone were U.S. nationals, not U.S.
       citizens. That was the result of a U.S. Supreme Court case in 1905,
       Rasmussen v. U.S.
       Eventually, this situation troubled Congress, so in 1937, Congress
       passed legislation granting statutory citizenship to Canal Zone
       babies born to at least one U.S. citizen parent. They made it
       retroactive to 1904, so baby John, born in 1936, was entitled to
       statutory citizenship that way. (The section is still in the
       law--see Title 8, s. 1403.)
       The other way that baby John was entitled to his citizenship is
       that he was born to two U.S. citizen parents.

   Someday soon Orly will explain her theory of why Cruz is a natural born

   up with the theory.

   Then they'll all repeat it thousands upon thousands of times in blogs
   and comment sections throughout the internet.

   Nothing anybody says will have any effect on their beliefs whatsoever.

       Canada like many jurisdictions has the principle of Jus soli
       meaning you acquire Canadian citizenship at birth.
       However at birth he also inherited his mother's American
       Citizenship because American permits citizenship to passed from
       mother to son in that fashion.
       Therefore he is a native born American(i.e. not naturalized), even
       if the declaration of citizenship was done later it is immaterial.
        He already was in considered American in the eyes of the law.

 An important point ([322]0+ / 0-)
       I guess it would depend on the paperwork then. I had a friend who
       had a child while her husband was serving in the US armed services
       in Turkey. The child carries dual citizenship but that situation
       isn't really analogous either. If Cruz's citizenship had to be
       applied for, rather than being granted automatically as a military
       dependent, that changes everything, doesn't it?

 Process ([326]0+ / 0-)
       If one or both parents are U.S. citizens, then they aren't applying
       for citizenship. They are proving that their child is an American
       citizen.
       The parents submit all the paperwork required to prove their
       citizenship and the baby's birth. The State Department determines
       whether the baby is a citizen, and then notifies the parents in
       writing that the baby is regarded by the U.S. government as a U.S.
       citizen born abroad.
       There may be some additional steps to prove parentage if the State
       Department has any questions about whether this baby is indeed the
       biological child of an American citizen.
       After they get the State Department's written confirmation, then
       the parents can take the next step of applying for the passport.

 Baby born in Turkey ([330]0+ / 0-)
       Margaret, if the baby was born in Turkey, then the parents had to
       do basically the same thing that the Cruzes did many years earlier:
       provide the information required to prove the U.S. citizenship of
       the parent(s) and to provide proof that this baby was indeed their
       biological child.
       It is no more or less automatic, in the sense of how many hoops the
       baby has to jump through.
       The State Department is no doubt quite confident that a  woman
       named on a birth certificate is indeed the same woman who gave
       birth to a baby in a U.S. military hospital. So that's good.
       But a baby born in Turkey--even one born in a U.S. military
       hospital--and a baby born in Calgary are in the same basic position
       of being U.S. citizens born abroad.
       For both, once you prove the citizenship of the parent(s) and the
       birth of this baby to them, then in due course you hear back from
       the State Department that the baby's citizenship has been
       recognized.

 Dual citizen ([334]0+ / 0-)

   Ted Cruz was a dual citizen at the very moment of his birth: a citizen
   of Canada because he was born in Canada, and a citizen of the U.S.
   because his mother transmitted her citizenship to him.

   The parents would have notified the Consulate General in Calgary.
   (There was one: the first Consulate General in Calgary was established
   in 1906.)

   Paperwork would have been submitted--mom's passport, Ted's birth
   certificate, etc.

   In due course, the parents would have received confirmation from the
   State Department that baby Ted was indeed recognized as a citizen who
   had been born abroad. All they needed to do then was apply for a
   passport for him.

 I would contend ([460]0+ / 0-)

   that Cruz is not natural born. Natural born means born in US or
   territory considered US. It depends on if a consular form of US citizen
   born abroad was completed, I am not sure if the consular form overrides
   this.

   Basically, if any paperwork has to be done to make you a citizen, then
   you are not natural born. McCain had this problem because he was born
   in a part of Panama that was not considered a territory. The law was
   changed 9 months later, but at birth he was not natural born. McCain is
   a naturalized citizen.

   Cruz might be a citizen because his mother was, but that might not make
   him natural born as required to be president. Again, it is where you
   are born, not who your parents are. If both Obama's parents were
   Kenyan, he would be natural born because he was born in the US.

   I wonder, if he was born in Canada was he a Canadian citizen at birth?
   I will do more research because this is interesting.

 Paperwork and what it means ([463]0+ / 0-)
       The paperwork that parents file with the State Department is not to
       "make" the child a citizen: it is to prove citizenship.
       A baby born abroad to U.S. citizen parents is a citizen by birth.
       The parents submit proof of U.S. citizenship of one or both
       parents, and submit proof that they've had a baby, and it is the
       biological child of at least one U.S. citizen.
       If parents want to obtain a passport for a baby born in the United
       States, they file paperwork with the State Department to prove that
       the child is a citizen and eligible for a passport.
       What has to be proven is different.
       If the baby is born in the U.S., then to get a passport for the
       baby you have to prove birth in the U.S.
       If the baby is born abroad, then to get a passport for the baby you
       have to prove parental citizenship (U.S., obviously) and the birth
       of the baby to you.
       If the parents don't file the paperwork after they have the baby,
       the baby is still a U.S. citizen. His or her citizenship can be
       recognized years later after he or she files the documents proving
       all those facts. The U.S. government will be recognizing, not
       granting, U.S. citizenship in this situation.

   It's not as if Luke Russert or Mark Halperin have to read beyond the

   The National Review doesn't have to actually name a non-Movement
   Conservative birther. They just need the headline out there. That's the
   genius of where we are right now in terms of our political discourse.
   They just need to say it's something both sides have their fingerprints

   put it in a future column or piece. They might even include the phrase
   "the influential conservative magazine the National Review has reported

   Magazine. The Daily Beast. That's all you have to do to "balance" out
   the GOP being overrun with crazy with phantom Democrats and liberals

   Nobody on the left disputes the fact that Cruz was born in Calgary, as
   he says.
   Whether under the Constitution he is eligible to be president is open
   to question, although it may well be that he is eligible.
   To have wondered about it does not make one a "birther."
   And let's hope the man never gets near the Oval Office, whether
   eligible or not.

 And he's an ass who crashed 5 fighter aircraft ([529]0+ / 0-)
       and nearly destroyed the USS Forestall single-handed.
       Show me one US Navy pilot that had the opportunity to crash their
       third aircraft. No one but an Admirals' son would be allowed to
       continue flying after destroying a forth very expensive piece of
       equipment.
       Yet, John McCain was given a fifth very expensive piece of military
       hardware to once again fail in a mission by disobeying orders
       resulting in the loss of aircraft and his subsequent capture by the
       enemy.
       As an aside - the military considers highly trained & briefed
       personnel such as he valuable assets, like property. So much time
       and money goes into training a Navy fighter pilot they are
       considered valued property.
       By disobeying orders McCain not only cost the Navy yet another
       fighter/bomber aircraft, he nullified all the time, money and
       training that went into his 'career'.
       Serious accountants may be able to calculate the total cost of
       McCain's time in the Navy from Annapolis, flight school, 5
       aircraft, food, lodging, medical care and the myriad agencies
       involved in obtaining his release from capture.
       McCain was born in a US Government hospital and has been the
       beneficiary of publicly funded care and education his entire life.
       He's never knew a day without healthcare or a government
       subsistence check in one way or the other.

 But there's no question of his place of birth -- ([572]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [573]Mathazar

   The essence of Birtherism isn't even a question of law -- which was
   certainly addressed with John McCain and George Romney before him, if
   not directly answered by precedent. The Birthers insist on denying
   evidence of the President's birth as well as convoluted theories about
   the nature of citizenship. "Birtherism" is essentially about trying to
   ostracize the "otherness" of President Obama.

   The intent around the clause requiring a "natural born" citizen for the
   President was because the Founders were wary of the idea of importing a
   leader who did not have the allegiance of having grown up in the
   American culture - and this was more or less a direct swipe at the
   British Royal family, who were a German royal house that was
   simultaneously King of Hanover while King of the United Kingdom -
   although George III was born in England, his father and grandfather
   were not. The lack of having been brought up in the tradition of
   English Common law was considered one of the flaws of the rule by the
   King, and the weakened influence of Parliament and the lack of
   representation for the American colonies in the same to assert their
   rights under English common law were seen as inextricably linked.

   So if you want to take a page out of the Tea Party's histrionics and
   insist on following the Founders' intent, it has to do not really with
   the actual fact of birth so much as whether the candidate has been
   imbued with the American idea by their family, culture, and upbringing.
    The facts of both Obama's birth and his pretty All-American upbringing
   (hardworking grandparents from Kansas, striving self-made mother)
   compared to living overseas for a couple of years in elementary school
   (something done by hundreds of thousands of military family kids every
   year, such as John McCain, born in Panama) clearly support the intent,
   and AFAIK Senator Cruz' bona fides in this area are just as valid. (Who
   could mistake him for anything but a guy from Texas, anyway?)

   Birtherism is really about aligning yourself with a fundamental unease
   with Obama because he's black, and looking for a legalistic cover for
   either conscious or unconscious reasons, depending on how racist you
   think you actually are.
