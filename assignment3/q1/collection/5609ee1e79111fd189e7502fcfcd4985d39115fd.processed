[23]Gov. Chris Christie announces special election to fill Frank Lautenberg's
Senate seat

   U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) official portrait
   A replacement for Frank Lautenberg
   will be selected this October
   [30]At a press conference this afternoon, Republican Gov. Chris
   Christie announced that a special election to fill the late Sen. Frank
   Lautenberg's Senate seat would take place on Oct. 16 (a Wednesday),
   with a primary to be held on Aug. 13. This move will undoubtedly please
   Democrats, who will have the chance to replace Lautenberg quickly. And
   Christie, who is up for re-election this November, gets to avoid
   sharing a ballot with a popular Democrat such as Newark Mayor Cory
   Booker, who has long had his eye on the Senate.

   Republican partisans will probably be upset, though, since an interim
   pick (which Christie did not yet announce) could have conceivably
   served through at least November 2014, giving the GOP one extra vote on
   the Senate floor for almost 18 months. And the advantages of
   quasi-incumbency might have given that temporary Republican senator a
   fighting chance of winning an election for a full term. Instead, the
   GOP will have just a few months to gear up for special election in a
   blue state, and even if the appointee were to run, Democrats would
   still be strongly favored.

   Christie's decision also avoids a legal battle, as Democrats had been
   insisting that a special take place this year; now, they've gotten what
   they wanted. However, New Jersey law remains unclear on when exactly
   vacancies should be filled by special elections, so this issue could
   well come up again another day. In the meantime, ambitious Democrats
   will have to decide whether they want to make a go of this race, or
   whether they'll defer to the well-funded Booker, who is furthest along
   in his preparations to run. We'll be following all developments here
   closely.

   [31]11:06 AM PT: [32]Great headline: "Christie Previously Signed Law to
   Consolidate Elections to Save Money." Christie's explanation, by the
   way, for why the Senate special won't take place on the same day as the
   regular November general election is because he would have had to wait
   10 days to issue the writ calling for the election in the first place.
   Obviously that's a bogus rationalization.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       He pleases the democrats who will most likely get Booker in the
       senate and then re-elect him in a blue state in a landslide.
       Also by doing this now he figures by the 2016 race it will be
       forgotten.

   I have a feeling Christie is putting his efforts into staying Governor,
   and staying prominent nationally. I also figure he's a smart enough
   politician to realize that he has no chance at the nomination as long
   as the American Taliban is in charge of the Republican Primary. I think
   he knows he doesn't fit with a party that would pick Romney over
   Huntsman, and kept Santorum and Gingrich in the race longer than
   Huntsman. He knows rational and pragmatic is not the path to the
   Whitehouse.

   Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your
   shackles. It is by the picket line and direct action that true freedom
   will be won, not by electing people who promise to screw us less than
   the other guy.

       They'd do their best to make sure Christie makes it through the
       primaries, if he declares his intent. I think he is the more
       challenging opponent to defeat in a general election, compared to
       any of the other current potential candidate.
       And let's face it: if Christie is indeed aiming for 2016, he's been
       making all the right moves, politically.

       my book.  I do wish people who don't live in an area and have no

       opportunist and a Corporatist.  By her report, as an actual

   This is, basically, conceding the seat to the Dems.

       This move definitely helps him in the Northeast and the West where

       I am pretty far to the left. I hate what Christie has done to
       education in the state. As a commuter, I hate the fact that he
       cancelled the railway tunnel. BUT, I do admire his willingness to
       go to bat for the state after the disaster. He was willing to be
       seen hugging President Obama--something that 99.9% of Republicans
       would not do. As a Jersey girl, I also appreciate his attitude. I
       will vote for Buono because her politics are closer to mine, but I

       Revolting but true.  No, I'm not voting for him......or anyone like

       the last time Lautenberg ran, when I thought him too old but
       couldn't find anyone else to vote for.  Christie gets away with a
       lot because he kicks at out groups and people either don't care or
       enjoy the show.  Wait till he gets to them.  But it will take quite
       a while for them to realize and quite a few won't ever because
       they're emotionally invested in his power over act.  Surrogate
       dominator.   What's the masculine for dominatrix?

 The other problem is that ([749]0+ / 0-)
       his bullying is also often interpreted, for some reason, as him

       The only thing he's ever done that I liked (well, besides his
       handling of Sandy, but as I said before, to me, that's the bare
       minimum for what his job entails anyway so I don't count it) was
       that time he appointed a Muslim judge, and then proceeded to call
       out the anti-Muslim, "OH NOES SHARIA!" nutjobs.
       But I suppose it's like the old saying goes, even a broken clock is

       For those who like the whole story, many shore residents are still

 I try to stay on point, sort of, with the shore ([761]0+ / 0-)
       scene.  It's ugly.  The NJ DEP has jumped on FEMA's preliminary
       flood maps and made their standards mandatory.
       [762]http://www.usatoday.com/...  I don't mind taking a long term
       decision to halt protection plans and projects and shift to
       removing buildings from flood prone areas.  Makes sense.  But
       people need fair value compensation and re-location help.
       I've seen first hand what floods do to habitations.  It's
       unspeakable, filthy, utterly disgusting.  My advice is don't build
       near water and don't even look at houses that have been or could
       have been flooded--even slightly.  You cannot get that muck out of
       all the places in a building it gets into.  Water flows, you know?
        And what flows in a flood is all the sewerage and pollution and
       poisons anywhere in the entire watershed area.  That house in
       Galveston famously the only thing standing after Katrina?  I
       wouldn' t set foot in it.  Anyone who worked on restoration or tear
       down should have been hazardous material protected head to foot.
       I can't find the patch article that had a interview with a women
       who chairs a local environmental group, but she advocated the
       (immensely) unpopular opinion that rebuilding and raising
       protective structures is a waste of taxpayer money.  What's the
       definition of insanity:  doing the same thing over and over and
       expecting a different outcome?

   Yes, it's conceding the U.S. Senate seat to the Dems.  But we were
   probably going to win that seat anyway.  By keeping Booker off a
   November 2013 election, he can possibly win a few state legislative
   seats for the GOP.  He might even be able to flip the NJ House or
   Senate, although less likely.  Even a few more GOP seats in both houses
   would make it easier for him to govern his second term.

   politico. Same year, and while the October general date may have been
   to help Christie in November it also will help Booker. Looks like a
   hold for Democrats. Will there be a major GOP opponent?

   ...at Christie is that he's wasting a ton of money holding a 2nd
   election just 3 weeks before the General, for purely personal political
   purposes (say that 5 times fast...)

   Smart move given his options. He'll still win, just by a few points
   less than he otherwise would be likely to.

   He gets what he wants--a solid 2nd term as Gov and a clear shot at the
   nomination in 2016; Booker gets what he wants and Dems get what they
   want nationally.

       Christie was not ever for fiscal responsibility.  He's for taxing
       the poor, not his rich friends and benefactors.  The tunnel
       cancellation was a money grab.  Property taxes in NJ are through
       the roof, but income tax rates are low.  This man is a terrible,
       terrible governor, but the press lets him get away with it.  Sad
       really.

       my comment was facetious.  I know that Christie doesn't give an ish
       about fiscal responsibility.  It's all about him.  As the diarist
       added above in an update,

     "Christie Previously Signed Law to Consolidate Elections to Save
     Money." Christie's explanation, by the way, for why the Senate
     special won't take place on the same day as the regular November
     general election is because he would have had to wait 10 days to
     issue the writ calling for the election in the first place.
     Obviously that's a bogus rationalization.
       Gov Christie is a master of smoke and mirrors and NJ voters don't
       even question him.  Dems should be especially ashamed of buying his
       BS.

   would vote in large numbers for the Democratic candidate for governor.

   Christie could have nominated himself which might have put him in a
   better position in 2020 or 2024.

   He might also have nominated a genuinely weak Democrat.

   He could have nominated Cory Booker without an extra election. Pallone
   would have been furious but that might have opened a schism in the
   Democratic party between county machines.

     Chris Christie in [1171]swimming in Democratic money as he runs for
     reelection. His Democratic opponent, Barbara Buono, is ignored by
     the national press and the sort of people that would usually be
     writing checks for the Democratic challenger to a Republican
     governor in a large, liberal state.

     Hugging Barack Obama was maybe the best political decision New
     Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has ever made, and he's made some very
     canny ones. I'm not saying his embrace of the president following
     Hurricane Sandy was entirely cynical, but it was very boisterous,
     and it continued through last week, when Obama visited the Jersey
     Shore [1172]and once again made nice with Christie before the
     national TV news cameras.

     Here's what's odd about this Republican governor who currently seems
     much more popular with Democrats than national Republicans: He's
     quite conservative. Especially for the Northeast. That was, in fact,
     his original appeal, back when conservatives were thrilled about
     him: He's the most conservative possible successful statewide
     officeholder for a blue state like New Jersey...

   Well-done piece, David. You capture all of the salient points to this
   story, and quite concisely so, IMHO. Thanks for this breaking news.

       Christie's economic policies are straight up right wing, but he

   that he may put his lt gov in the Senate as an interim pick it makes
   sense. His ticket can remain intact for the Nov. election that he is
   almost certain to win. Assuming the Republican wins, which he

   for a month until the November election. At that point, the lt gov
   could either resign the senate and go back to being lt gov, in which
   case Christie still gets to pick a Republican to fill the seat through
   2014, giving that individual the advantages of incumbency, or else
   Christie gets to hand pick a new lt gov that won't have to face voters

       I used to live in his district until redistricting.  I'm on a first
       name basis with the guy so obviously he's my first choice (and has
       my vote in the primary).
       Both Pallone and Booker put different constituencies into play.
       Booker brings out the minority voters (although he did not the last
       time he was on the ballot in Newark, I volunteered on that race).
       While Booker has a demographic advantage, Pallone has a geographic
       advantage.  He is from red Monmouth County and one of his top
       issues has been protecting NJ's shoreline and beaches (his campaign
       bumper sticker reads "I <3 NJ Beaches" and yes one is on my car).
       He puts the shore counties (typically Republican) more in play
       (except for Atlantic City) than Booker would.
       In the primary Pallone has my vote.

   with a popular Democrat (Mayor Booker) who is likely to win this Senate
   election by a crushing margin. Maybe only political geeks care about
   that, but it gives Barbara Buono a good laugh/boo line or two for the
   stump.

   2. It's sooner rather than later. That's good for voters and good for
   government, but it won't go over well with Republicans who really
   wanted to have Gov. Christie's appointee serve until 2014 or hopefully
   beyond.

   3. It's going to cost the state money that holding the election
   concurrent with the 2013 or 2014 general election (or even the 2014
   primary) would not have cost, and that makes Christie look like a
   hypocrite.

   4. It gives whoever Christie appoints very little time to assume the
   airs of incumbency, i.e. becoming recognized by New Jerseyans as "their
   senator". The interim appointee will be seen as very much a placeholder
   until New Jersey elects a liberal Democrat in the mold of the late
   Frank Lautenberg in October.

   5. No announcement of an appointee means Christie is going to come
   under heavier pressure from the Republican Party, which cannot be
   pleased about what many activists will see as the governor "caving" to
   Democrats' demands to have a 2013 special election, to name a stalwart
   conservative. If Christie ends up doing that, it tarnishes his brand
   and will come off as a (perhaps in-character) fuck-you to voters for
   some. If he doesn't, Republicans get even angrier with him.

 Point 1 ([1616]0+ / 0-)
       Regarding point 1, how come people are assuming that the coattails
       of a Dem Senate win in November would hurt Christie's election
       results?  Could the opposite be possible?:  the coattails of a
       likely Christie reelection could hurt the Dem's chance at winning
       the Senate seat?

       that it would help Dem turnout in general, hobbling Christie's
       chances of narrowing the Dem legislative majority.  It would also
       help Dems in county races.

 this seems like a "two-fer" for Democrats... ([1633]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1634]wintergreen8694

   ...and possibly even a "three-fer":

   While a lot of folks have been speculating that Christie had few good
   options here, to me it seems his best option was to continue to burnish
   his image as a post-partisan/non-partisan, pragmatist who cares only
   about solving problems in the interest of the People of the state. (By
   holding the special election on the regularly scheduled November
   election day to save money.) (That may not necessarily be true...but
   it's the image that he's developed.)

   This decision could actually come back to bite Christie, in my opinion,
   in at least two ways (and possibly three):

   1) This gives his opponent, Barbara Buono, an issue to use against him.
   Depending on how politically astute she is, it could be a potent one in
   my opinion: Why is Gov. Christie wasting millions of taxpayer dollars
   for his own personal benefit? Holding this election three-weeks before
   the November elections already scheduled is a waste of taxpayer dollars
   and is a clear demonstration that, despite all of his rhetoric and his
   image...Christie cares primarily about himself, not the People of New
   Jersey. This decision helps undermine Christie's entire image as
   someone who cares more about the people of his state than politics.
   It's a waste of taxpayer dollars. And it makes no sense.

   2) This diminishes Republican chances for holding onto this Senate
   seat.

   (And, thirdly, this could hurt him with Republicans, not only statewide
   in his reelection bid this year but nationally should he run for
   president. Something like this would likely be brought up in a
   presidential campaign. It isn't exactly something that will help to
   endear him to Republicans, many of whom are already not so crazy about
   Christie's friendliness towards Barack Obama and certain Democratic
   positions.)
