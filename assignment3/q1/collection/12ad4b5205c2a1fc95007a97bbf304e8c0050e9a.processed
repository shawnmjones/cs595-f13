Sources: 3 al Qaeda operatives took part in Benghazi attack

   By Paul Cruickshank. Tim Lister. Nic Robertson and Fran Townsend, CNN

   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * "Three or four members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula," took
       part, one source says

   (CNN) -- Several Yemeni men belonging to al Qaeda took part in the
   terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi last
   September, according to several sources who have spoken with CNN.

   One senior U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that "three or four
   members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula," or AQAP, took part in
   the attack.

   Another source briefed on the Benghazi investigation said Western
   intelligence services suspect the men may have been sent by the group
   specifically to carry out the attack. But it's not been ruled out that
   they were already in the city and participated as the opportunity
   arose.

   The attack on the compound and subsequently on a "safe-house" to which
   Americans had been evacuated left four U.S. citizens dead, including
   the ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens.
   Demonstrators set the U.S. Consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya, on
   fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador and three other U.S.
   nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration
   initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked
   Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the
   consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack. View photos of

   New leads in Benghazi attack
   Benghazi investigation under review
   No charges yet in Benghazi attack

   If the AQAP members were dispatched to Benghazi, it would be further
   evidence of a new level of co-operation among jihadist groups
   throughout the Middle East and North Africa, counterterrorism analysts
   say.

   According to one source, counterterrorism officials learned the
   identity of the men and established they had spent two nights in
   Benghazi after the attack. Western intelligence agencies began trying
   to track the men in the aftermath of the terrorist attack, but were
   always behind in their manhunt.

   They were later traced to northern Mali, where they are believed to
   have connected with a fighting group commanded by Moktar Belmoktar, a
   prominent jihadist leader, according to a senior law enforcement
   source.

   The trail appears to have then gone cold. In early 2013, jihadists were
   driven out of many areas of northern Mali in a French-led offensive.

   Another source briefed on the investigation had previously told CNN
   that Belmoktar had received a call in the aftermath of the Benghazi
   attack from someone in or close to the city. Whoever made the call was
   excited.

   [41]"Mabruk, Mabruk!" he repeated, meaning "Congratulations" in Arabic.

   There is no proof the call was specifically about the attack, but the
   source says that is the assumption among those with knowledge of the
   call. One source says the phone call was discovered when a Western
   intelligence service trawled through intercepts of communications made
   in the wake of the attack.

   CIA officials told CNN they had no comment on whether any call had been
   intercepted.

   One other source briefed by Western intelligence told CNN a call was
   intercepted but said only that it was placed to an AQIM commander, not
   specifically Belmoktar.

   Belmoktar is an Algerian terrorist operative linked to al Qaeda in the
   Islamic Maghreb who claimed responsibility for the attack on the In
   Amenas gas facility in southern Algeria in January this year. Some 38
   people were killed during a three-day siege there.

   Chadian troops supporting the French intervention in Mali claimed in
   March that Belmoktar and others in his group [42]had been killed during
   an operation in the remote Adrar des Ifhogas mountain range.

   There has never been any confirmation of his death, and one source
   briefed by Western and regional intelligence officials told CNN that
   Belmoktar may have started operating in the "desert triangle"
   straddling the borders of Algeria, Niger and Libya.

   Belmoktar is believed to have moved to the region in late 2012 after
   signs that an international intervention in Mali was growing more
   likely. Known as 'the Salvador pass,' the area is a key transit points
   for drug traffickers and international criminal groups.

   The FBI released grainy photographs Wednesday of three men said to have
   been at the Benghazi compound on the night of the attack, saying it was
   "seeking information" on them. It is not known whether any of them are
   the AQAP individuals.

   AQAP is regarded as one of the most active and dangerous of al Qaeda
   franchises. It has tried to launch several attacks on the U.S.
   homeland. On Christmas Day 2009, a Nigerian recruited by the group
   attempted to blow up a plane flying into Detroit but failed because his
   device malfunctioned. The following October the group attempted to blow
   up planes heading to the United States with printer bombs disguised as
   air cargo. The packages were intercepted after a tip from Saudi
   intelligence. And in April 2012, a British informant working for Saudi
   counterterrorism thwarted a new plot by the group to bomb a U.S-bound
   airliner. The informant had infiltrated the group and was selected by
   them to launch the attack.

   AQAP was the first al Qaeda affiliate to comment on the Benghazi
   attack. On September 14 it released a statement arguing the attack was
   revenge for the death of Abu Yahya al-Libi, a senior al Qaeda
   operative, in Pakistan in June 2012. It did not claim responsibility
   for the attack.

   On September 10 -- at least 18 hours before the attack -- al Qaeda
   leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a video timed for the anniversary of 9/11,
   called for attacks on Americans in Libya to avenge the death of
   al-Libi.

   In March, Libyan authorities detained a man called Faraj al-Shibli in
   Libya on suspicion of links to the attack, according to several
   officials. The FBI was able to interview him in the presence of Libyan
   officials, according to one Libyan source. It appears al-Shibli was
   detained after returning from a trip to Pakistan, sources said.

   It remains unclear exactly whether al-Shibli was present at the U.S.
   compound at the time of the attack. It's also unclear whether his
   detention is likely to lead to charges in connection with the attack.
   Investigators have learned that al-Shibli has had contact with the
   Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula as well as al Qaeda
   members in Pakistan, sources said.

   The Libyan Interior Ministry refused to confirm he is still in custody,
   saying it could not comment on an ongoing investigation.

   Al-Shibli is the only known suspect in custody in connection with the
   attack in Benghazi. A 26-year-old Tunisian, Ali Ani al-Harzi, was held
   in Tunis for several weeks in connection with the assault on the
   compound after being extradited from Turkey. But he was released by a
   Tunisian judge in January on grounds on insufficient evidence.

   In December, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation
   said authorities were examining whether the alleged leader of a
   post-revolution terrorist network in Egypt had played a role in the
   September 11 attack. Mohammed Jamal Abu Ahmed was released from jail
   after the downfall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and is believed
   to be the driving force behind a new militant group, according to two
   U.S. officials.

   Abu Ahmed was previously a member of al-Zawahiri's group, Egyptian
   Islamic Jihad. He is currently in prison in Egypt after being arrested
   in December, when police raided a Cairo apartment allegedly being used
   by a jihadist group. An associate of Abu Ahmed's subsequently said that
   he had not been in Benghazi or anywhere in Libya on the day of the
   attack on the compound.

   In the wake of the revolts that have shaken the Arab world, al Qaeda
   sympathizers have found new space in which to operate, and would-be
   jihadists have found new causes to embrace. In Syria, the al-Nusra
   Front has proclaimed its links to the al Qaeda affiliate in Iraq.
   Militants from Tunisia, Libya and elsewhere have gone to Syria. In west
   Africa, Nigerian jihadists with Boko Haram have established links with
   al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and trained in Mali.

   If AQAP sent members thousands of miles to help launch an attack on
   U.S. diplomats, it would show that even if al Qaeda central remains
   under pressure, its fellow travelers are finding new ways to continue
   its campaign of terror.
