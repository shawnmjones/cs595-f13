Dems, GOP fight over student loan rates

   Student loans already feel like a millstone for millions of Americans.

   The issue of student loan interest rates has been simmering for a
   while, but with a deadline looming in July, Democrats are moving
   quickly to put the issue to the front burner.

   At issue is a 2007 law, set to expire on July 1, that keeps the
   interest rate for federal Direct Stafford Loans at 3.4%. If Congress
   fails to act, the rate will double, so Reps. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and
   Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) have put forward a bill to make sure [3]that
   doesn't happen.

   When the 2007 measure passed, it enjoyed broad bipartisan support, but
   Republicans have clearly moved sharply to the right in the ensuing five
   years, and are now balking at Democratic efforts.

   The White House seems to [4]feel strongly about the issue.

     White House press secretary Jay Carney swiped at Republicans on
     Friday, saying that they should prevent student loans rates from
     doubling in July.

     "You really have to have a brick in your head not to understand that
     education is the cornerstone of our economic future," Carney said.

   Education Secretary Arne Duncan added, "At a time when going to college
   has never been more important, it has also unfortunately never been
   more expensive. Families and students are struggling to meet these
   costs. And there is no reason we should add to their burden."

   Did I mention that President Obama will be speaking on college campuses
   in the coming days in North Carolina, Colorado, and Iowa? Expect to
   hear him talk about this quite a bit.

   In fairness, it's worth noting that Republicans have argued,
   accurately, that the lower rate would cost [5]about $6 billion
   according to the Congressional Budget Office, and Democrats haven't
   said much about how they'd pay for the extended rate freeze.

   Then again, House Republicans just passed an unnecessary tax cut bill
   with a $46 billion price tag, which they didn't try to pay for, either.
   For GOP officials to say we can afford to [6]add $46 billion to the
   deficit for a tax break, but we can't afford $6 billion on student aid,
   is a problem.

   Besides, if the Buffett Rule only brings in $7 billion a year, and
   congressional Republicans characterized that as an effectively
   meaningless rounding error in the context of the larger budget, why
   should the GOP balk at $6 billion a year to help students and their
   families better afford tuition costs?

   As for the president's likely opponent, Mitt Romney has said he intends
   to [7]dramatically scale back the federal role in helping students go
   to college.

   Republicans are begging for the Occupy movement to regroup. This is a
   big issue for students and if the Republicans block the bill, it may be
   the catalyst to bring out student protests again. I hope the
   Republicans do block the bill so that students can mobilize for this
   bill, the Occupy movement and the elections. It would do for the Dems
   what they are unable to do--communicate an effective message to the
   whole middle class in all states including the red ones. A galvanized
   Occupy movement would be a Republican nightmare even in safe states and
   districts.

   The rate is irelevent compared to the cost of tuition. College costs
   are out of control. You can argue that football coaches make millions,
   but what programs pay for all the useless other sports on the campus.

   When I went to college. many years ago, it costs $4,000 for 4 years in
   a private school. Another $10,000 for graduate school. I might add my
   degrees were in economics and finance, marketable skills.

   I paid $60,000 20 years ago for my son to go to college. All toll,
   after 3 kids, I've spent well over $200,000 on college. What changed?
   Easy money, and no personal responsibility for repaying. Useless
   majors. And, the lack of a military draft

     Easy money, and no personal responsibility for repaying. Useless
     majors.

   What exactly is a 'useless' major and how does one access whether or
   not a major is or isn't 'useful'? And what do you mean there's no
   personal responsibility to pay back loans? I think you are confusing
   grants w/ loans. Grants you do not have to pay back, but you have to
   meet certain requirements in order to be given them. Not every student
   qualifies for public grants. You have to be at a certain income or be
   the first person in your family to attend college or have been an honor
   student in high school or something else in order to be given a grants.
   Many grants also require that you meet a certain GPA in order to
   continue receiving them. If your GPA drops then you are no longer given
   that money. Federal loans work similarly except you have to pay them
   back- they are, afterall, loans. You have to have a passing GPA (C
   average or above) in order to continue to qualify for federal loans.
   Whether or not you qualify for federal loans depends on your family's
   income and whether or not your parents went to college. If your parents
   went to college the amount you get in a public loan is less than if
   they did not. If your family is of middle or upper income then the
   amount you get in a loan is significantly smaller than that of families
   who are lower income. There are also rules on how you can spend your
   money and on what. It's a federal crime, in fact, to spend student loan
   money on non-approved items. You can and will have your public loan
   revoked if you spend it on items that are not approved and you could
   face jail time and significant fines as a result.

   I should also point out that it's a federal crime to not pay back your
   public debt unless your public debt has been excused. Are you seriously
   admitting on a public forum that you and/or your children are violating
   federal law? Dude that's pretty serious

   Yes, tuition is a scandal and a horror. But I know a thing or two about
   student loan debt from a professional angle, and doubling the interest
   rate on the debt that some people are carrying would be an act of
   financial sadism. And letting the interest rate double would do nothing
   to lower tuition, so why even bring that into the question?

   Your last paragraph is a patently nonsensical attempt to blame those
   with large student-loan debt for the size of their debt. Contrary to
   your 'oh-pity-poor-responsible-me' complaint, student-loan debt must be
   repaid, same as any other debt. I know for a fact that loan servicers
   are being required to reduce default rates. I also know that some
   people go into Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy over their debt, so
   bang goes that bleat. There is responsibility, and there are
   consequences for being unwilling or unable to meet them.

   You should know that hose with the greatest amount of debt tend to
   people who went into medicine, or law. Do those fall under the heading
   of 'useless majors'? If not, there's another whinge down the crapper.

   Finally, what the frak has the draft got to do with student-loan debt?
   Unless you are trying to make the case that the draft would allow more
   people benefit from the GI Bill (which wouldn't be that bad of an
   argument), then it seems like you have simply resorted to padding.

   So let me get this straight. We could pass the Buffet rule and that
   would bring in about enough revenue to cover the student loans.

   ....Or we can spend that money giving tax cuts

     Mitt Romney has said he intends to [32]dramatically scale back the

   Yes because that will help us totally bring jobs back to the US. Do

   Pell Grants and the GI Bill are the only thing besides the US Mint that
   runs a profit.

   It costs about $20,000 for a bachelors degree from a state college.

   College increases income from about $13/hour to about $25/hour.

   This doubles income, and the corresponding tax increase is about
   $300,000 over a lifetime.

   That is called profit.

   Over 1,000% return on investment.

   A college education prevents incarceration, so this reduces government
   spending (a hot topic with the GOP).

   You have to be a flaming idiot to fail to recognize that the US economy
   began to dominate the world after the Pell Grant and GI BIll programs
   began.

   Stafford Loans prop up the Pell Grant and GI Bill program.

   These loans could be cancelled without risk after graduation from a
   low-cost public college because additional tax revenue will make up for
   the loss.

   Even with $140,000 average cost per student, education still runs a
   profit if you provide free education.

   The antipathy toward education comes from the groups of older people
   who have already received an education and their children are out of
   school. Now they believe that they should not have to pay for the
   education for other people and their children. That is part of the
   reason why people support the Republicans. A second reason is that some
   people believe the children are being indoctrinated with
   liberal/progressive/socialist/communist philosophy which they see as
   one and the same.

   You are trying to use logic and facts to make your case. The problem
   here is that those opposed to college loans and grants believe that a
   college education is a waste of time that should be spent on the job.
   You see they either had too poor of a GPA to get in or they did not
   want to knuckle down and learn when they could pull wrenches and drink
   beer instead. They see college as evil and all professors as far left
   radicals. They would have loved being raised in the USSR where their
   future would have been planned for them by the state. There they would
   have been told early that they were too ignorant to become engineers so
   they must go to a vocational high and become laborers.

   You make absolutely no sense. On behalf of my older generation, we see
   the value of a college education. We also see the value in blue collar
   work. The choice of which to persue is a personal one. But, we don't
   see college as an entitlement to be paid for by the tax payers.

   I just question why the cost of college has increased so much since the
   60's, far outpacing inflation. I also question the expansion in the
   number of college programs which offer little opportunity for expansive
   job offerings. Why major in puppeteering?

   Oh good lord. These are loans given out to a person. The only
   difference between a government loan and private business loan is that
   the government is able to provide you w/ an artificially lower rate.
   You must pay back your FAFSA and other loans over time. They will only
   waive that debt if it's been more than 20 years since you took out the
   loan and more than 75% of your tuition has been paid off.

   Beyond this it costs the taxpayers more money to not pay for college.
   This is why the government pays for student loans and grants in the
   first place. People who earn a degree make more money and therefore pay
   more in taxes. This, then, reduces the debt. It does not increase it.

     I just question why the cost of college has increased so much since
     the 60's, far outpacing inflation. I also question the expansion in
     the number of college programs which offer little opportunity for
     expansive job offerings. Why major in puppeteering?

   The purpose of a college degree is not singularly focused on that of
   getting a person a job, although this is the majority reason for why
   people attend school. College is a higher learning institution which
   means it's primary focus is on educating a person. Jobs, at least
   hypothetically, come about as a result of the critical thinking skills
   a person gains from school.

   FTR I'm not sure about a school that gives you the major of
   puppeteering. I am sure that there are schools that give you the major
   of acting or theater and included in that may be an emphasis on
   puppeteering...although I've never encountered such a thing. That seems
   like something you'd get at an apprenticeship school or at a community
   college for non-credit. But even so you're making an assumption here
   that a person could not turn that into a profession. While certainly it
   would be more difficult presumably someone going into the major of
   puppeteering would be well aware of his/her employment opportunities,
   the struggles inherent w/in, and would be making the decision on the
   basis of such.

   For the record there is no guarantee that any college degree will land
   a person a job. I know a person who graduated at the top of his class
   in the Air Force Academy who went on to become a registered Physical
   Therapist w/ the Air Force. He got his PT certification for the state
   of CO when his commissionship came up, but he could not get a job. So
   he now is a landscaper. I know another individual who is a close friend
   of mine who has an undergraduates degree in Computer Science from NYU
   and a graduate's degree in mathematics from MIT. He to this day has not
   been able to find a job w/ any industry...luckily for him his father
   owns a small computer service repair company and that's where he works
   now. I also know a person who has a law degree and still cannot find
   work.

   Ugh. Student loans are loans. Like a loan for a car, they have to be

   student loans are made directly by the federal government to the

   This whole Republican dark agenda is so ridiculous that it isn't even

   the middle class and poor people so everyone has to fend for himself or
   herself. They want everyone to carry their own gun for protection as
   they reduce law enforcement. They want to get rid of any environmental
   protection regulation we have so everyone can be subject to a real
   wasteland of pollution and contamination. And than when people start
   becoming sick, don't waste your time going to a hospital, because you
   will have no coverage to pay for it. But now that everyone is getting
   sick let's make sure we take away any woman's rights and keep her
   barefoot and pregnant in poverty, because we have to replace those
   people that are dying by the droves. We must also have no education for
   the average person either, since the people must stay illiterate and
   ignorant to everything that has been done to them. Who would even want
   to live in such a world like this, are these Republicans literally that
   insane, because to me this is a world that is just not worth living in.

   Are some of the countries that have free college education in the EU
   mess like Greece, Spain and Italy? I am all for higher education for
   all, but we have to find a balance between that and other
   programs...and that would of course include higher taxes as part of it.
   When I decided to go to college I never once thought of it as a right
   and I did not expect to get outright $$ for it. I just am not wired
   that way. I spent 5 years in the Navy, got out and used my GI bill.
   Since that didn't really cover all of it I worked 20-30 hours a week on
   campus and stayed in the Naval Reserves. I am not expecting a pat on
   the back for this.. it's just that I believed I had to work and earn my
   degree. I guess a little different and do not look at the Federal or
   State or local governments for aid in a category like college. I may be
   totally wrong, but that's how I thought about it and still do now. I
   honestly do no remember my parent's generation talking about grants and
   low interest loans to go to school. Yes, there was a big influx of
   college students as a result of the wars (GI Bill), but I did get the
   impression (at least from the families I lived around as a Navy brat)
   that it was something that people had to work hard for - some harder
   than others.

   I don't know...I'm just thinking about how the term entitlement has
   become more and more of a prominent term in today's world. And I just
   think that a college education would fall into a "want" type of aid
   rather than a "need" type of aid (food stamps, unemployment, etc) . Now
   if we have $$ left over after all the "need" entitlements are taken
   care of, then I am all for MORE college grants and low interest loans.
   But for now, we just can't keep overspending in an insanely excessive
   amount.

   Seriously skip? You've got to be kidding me

     I'm just thinking about how the term entitlement has become more and

   Because the Republican messaging machine keeps repeating this term over
   and over again and then, for whatever reason, you continuously pick up
   on it and then you too repeat the term over and over again (and yes I
   realize you're not a Republican so do not bother pointing that out- my

   using post hoc reasoning to conclude why).

     And I just think that a college education would fall into a "want"

   Absolutely no one is arguing w/ this

     But for now, we just can't keep overspending in an insanely
     excessive amount

   Repeat this w/ me skip: paying money up front for college costs less
   money in the long term.

   If you take government loans and grants out of college education you
   are going to see a massive reduction in the amount of income the middle
   class makes, a massive reduction in the amount of wealthy people that
   exist in this country, a massive reduction in overall GDP, and a
   massive reduction in the long-term employment rate.

   I just want to point this out. This particular conversation was started

   Then [91]Crackhead Awards responded who also did not mention

   Then [92]skip hoffman responded who mentioned entitlements.

   Then I responded and my only mention of entitlements was in pointing
   out the post hoc reasoning and in re-quoting skip.

   Then [93]MeddlingMonk responds and did not mention entitlements.

   The only people calling student loans entitlements are, apparently,
   those who do not see student loans are prudent investments. Which OK if
   you don't like them then you are certainly at liberty to make your
   case. But I just wanted to point out that it's only one segment who are
   talking about 'entitlements.' So stating that 'entitlements' keep
   coming up in conversation....well, like I said, that's some really

   Fair point Mouzer. Like i said in my first post I may be wrong :). But
   what would a federal grant be called? Just a grant. It is money given
   and no repayment required.

   I did chuckle on your "keep you government hands off my GI Bill" - I
   really did. I do see how hypocritical it looks. But I do see the GI
   Bill as part of the pay and benefits of serving in the military - you
   had to serve at least 6 months on active duty to get it, unlike a
   federal college grant that requires no such service.

   As I stated also earlier I am all for aid for college...I just look at
   it as a lower priority than other much needed programs. I have brought
   up the spending and debt issues our country has many times here
   (probably too much for some here) but I can not believe that most folks
   here barely mention the fact that we continually spend more than we
   take in - for so many straight years that it is becoming a habit. That
   is all I guess I was trying to get across. And yes I do believe in more
   taxes - but also a little less spending too.

   I am proud that I worked my ass off to get my degree. I left home at 17
   and joined the military for that very reason. I may have misspoken
   (misposted??) with the word entitlement I guess. I was trying to
   express my opinion that it seems that it is a given that the government
   will give you money for a college degree - everytime. Last week or so I
   heard a piece on the radio about 4 million trade jobs go unfilled
   because young people do not want to learn a trade skill, and the funny
   thing is most of the trade schools are paid for by unions and similar
   private concerns. The average pay of these trade skilled jobs are
   $60,000 too. Maybe this can solve some of this middle class issue you
   speak of my friend Mouzer :)

   So free or subsidized college is not an entitlement. Just want to make
   sure I got that right :).

     But what would a federal grant be called? Just a grant. It is money
     given and no repayment required.

     unlike a federal college grant that requires no such service.

   The GI bill is a grant that is given out to people who have served in
   the US military. And yes I would agree that it's a general benefit
   given to you for your service. I just thought the way you worded it
   came across as funny- it sounded like you were saying you didn't
   receive government benefits while simultaneously talking about your GI
   bill. I wouldn't care either way- I believe that you should receive
   government benefits, especially if you worked for the government (which
   you did). But it was just one of those double-take moments from how you
   worded it.

   Just as the GI bill requires that you meet the veteran/active duty
   status in order to receive it so too do the non-military based grants
   given by the federal government have strict requirements that you must
   meet and maintain. Federal grants have requirements that must be met to
   qualify such as income restrictions, family college status (so if you
   aren't the first in your family to go to college there are certain
   grants you automatically don't qualify for), or academic grants.
   Academic grants, as an example, require that you have a certain GPA and
   that you maintain that GPA. Failure to maintain the GPA will result in
   you losing your grant money and if you do not meet those requirements
   prior to applying you will also be denied.

   Some grants will make you pay if you do not maintain your GPA since the
   contract you make states that you must keep your grades above average.
   Grants operate differently than federal loans. A grant- w/ some
   exceptions- does not have to be paid back. As I said sometimes they
   will make you pay it back if it's found out that you abused the grant
   (like by not keeping your GPA up), but assuming you don't violate the
   contract a grant is something you don't have to pay back. A loan,
   however, from the federal government works exactly like a private loan
   w/ the exception of a sub-market level low rate. A regular student loan
   has anywhere from a 10-30% interest rate. A federal loan usually has
   anywhere from a 1%-4% interest rate. Both must be paid off over time.
   The government, for the record, makes a profit off programs like FAFSA.

     I just look at it as a lower priority than other much needed
     programs

   I am not sure anyone is disagreeing w/ you on this. The only thing I
   would add, however, is that we have a serious problem of income
   inequality and in particular we have a problem w/ too many people
   making too little money. Education is pretty much the only way to
   increase the income that individuals make. This also, ftr, increases
   the amount of money that they can pay in taxes which then goes on to
   help w/ the debt. But I would grant you that it's far more important to
   make sure someone is fed and clothed than to make sure someone goes to
   school.

     I was trying to express my opinion that it seems that it is a given
     that the government will give you money for a college degree -
     everytime

   This is far more sensible to state ;-) I suppose I was being a bit too
   sarcastic towards you, so I apologize. Sometimes I forget that people
   cannot hear the inflection w/ which you speak through the Internets.

   I guess to some extent people do believe that they will be given some
   federal money and to another extent they do not. Federal loans do not
   pay 100% of your college tuition rate. Federal loans and public grants
   usually only equate to about a third of your total tuition costs. Most
   college students then have to work and take out a private loan to
   finish off the remaining 2/3's or they have to use scholarships and
   private grants. I do not personally know of a single person who has
   gone to college in modern America who has not had to take out some type
   of loan from the private sector or who hasn't had to jump through hoops
   in order to get enough grant/scholarship money from the private sector
   so as to not have to take out private loans.

   When I say jump through hoops I mean I literally knew a person who
   applied for the Aryan Race Scholarship (yes such a thing exists)
   because it would offer him 600$ a semester to pay for tuition.

   I also know a person who donated an ovary to pay for college tuition
   (however in fairness to her this was to put her through medical school
   and medical school is abnormally expensive (like 150-200,000$)).

     Last week or so I heard a piece on the radio about 4 million trade
     jobs go unfilled because young people do not want to learn a trade
     skill, and the funny thing is most of the trade schools are paid for
     by unions and similar private concerns

   That is disturbing. I'd like to know more about that if you can find
   any information on it. My understanding is that a trade job requires
   that you get an apprenticeship. I have heard that in states like Iowa
   and Pennsylvania they still do apprenticeships...but most places don't
   do that. So I'm not sure how you'd get training for a trade job. Trade
   schools don't even exist in every state or every city any more.
   Community colleges usually will help you get a certificate or AA degree
   in in-demand fields or fields that require that you have specific
   training (like, for instance, Denver Automotive and Diesel College (my
   best friends sister was formerly married to a man who went there and
   got trained as an airplane mechanic....yeah he got a union job almost
   immediately and makes bank like 80k/yr now)).

     So free or subsidized college is not an entitlement

   Your complaint initially was that you heard the word entitlement too
   often. I was pointing out that this was silly reasoning. Your revised
   statement (in your rebuttal post) makes far more sense. I will gladly
   retract my previous statement about this since I was fixated on the
   dynamics of your language use rather than the meaning. I honestly had
   no idea what it was that you were talking about at the time- w/ your
   revised statement I feel that I have now connected the dots. Redacted
   =)

   I like debating with you Mouzer :). And to be fair, yes there are
   requirements to get federal grants so I guess they are just not
   throwing $$ at folks.

   I think I heard the trade school piece on "The Osgood Minute" which I
   hear on WBBM AM newsradio in the mornings on the way to work. I don't
   remember the piece verbatum, but it may have been about the
   apprentiships you mentioned as well as some trade schools. I did learn
   a trade myself in the service - although it was a very specialized
   skill. I started out working on flight simulators which required a
   working knowledge of electonics, hydraulics and basic flight training.
   A couple of my fellow "shipmates" did get pretty good paying jobs with
   airlines working on their simulators after their hitch. For me, the
   Navy in their infinite wisdom (pun intended) switched me over to Naval
   Intelligence after a few years (because they discontinued our rate
   /speciality and civilianized it). That was a bit more interesting...

   Well all I can say is the complete detachment of financial
   considerations from the people who are linked to these financial
   considerations is a new and weird turn of affairs in the world.

   I was reading in the NYT today that if the Socialists win in France
   then the (democratically elected) government will have to face off
   against what truly governs the world: "the markets.' The thesis in the
   article is that if Sarkozy wins there will be more austerity to satisfy
   "the markets" but less austerity if Hollande wins, deferring the
   gratification of "the markets" for some years down the road.

   "The markets" are the financial markets who long ago severed all
   relationship to the people on which these "markets" are ultimately
   based. It's almost like the pre-revolutionary aristocracy in France,
   wanting nothing more than to distance itself as much as possible from
   "the rabble." Who were, nevertheless, the ultimate source of the
   nation's wealth.

   You can't guillotine "the markets" but someone has to question
   seriously why this unelected aristocracy of financial whizzes gets to
   dictate to democracies around the world?

     Mitt Romney has said he intends to dramatically scale back the
     federal role in helping students go to college.

   He knows from personal experience that it's not needed.

   they have been telling it. they have used this excuse to take money
   away from much needed programs such as this. they dare put our country
   in such a mess, and blame Obama for it plus obstruct his progress ON
   PURPOSE, then cry that they can do a better job at fixing what THEY
   screwed up! TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS IS LIKE GETTING PISSED ON, SO,
   REPUBLICANS, PLEASE QUIT PISSING ON MY AMERICAN DREAM! GET OFF OF YOUR
   RICH LAZY BUTTS AND HELP OBAMA FIX THA MESS YOU ALL MADE. OR COME

   they better feel fortunate, if i had my way about it all, tha rich
   would be paying 40-45% in taxes, a high rate penalty on offshore
   accounts, id close all loopholes in tha tax system, outlaw lobbyists to
   pay off legislators, penalty of death for both offenders. and put a
   mandate that every canidate for federal public office has to spend 5
   years on tha street as a homeless person, stripped of their wealth and
   influence. i know this sounds extreme, but they have lost too much
   touch with tha common american. i would also enforce strict regulations
   on corporate america, not allowing any monopolies and tax at 75% rate
   to those companies who move their buisnesses outside of tha USA. i
   would also slash tha pay of every top official in tha government. if
   they have wealth before office, we dont need to give them that much
   pay, after all, we need to keep THEM in tha REAL world.... OUR WORLD. I
   have other ideas, but i know ppl think they are too extreme.... but
   they would solve all our problems, dont you think? i do!

   I'm not sure how many people know just the gravity of this situation.
   This is no joke. I like to occupy Gretawire, and after a year I have a
   pretty good sense of what is coming out of Fox, and just how effective
   their message is. I will go out on a limb and say 90% of that community
   have negative views of higher education. I am not exaggerating.
   Sometimes I feel like I am in a dream if I hang out there for too long.
   It's absolutely amazing.

   That said, I have a dog in this fight. (oh man, they would have a field
   day over there at GW with that comment). My son is graduating high
   school this june and has been accepted at UC Santa Cruz. He will be the
   first of anyone in his family to go to college. This is attributed to
   his amazing character, and hard work throughout high school. I don't
   know how we are going to afford this, but I'm pretty sure it will have
   to include loans. I was appalled when I read about this story today.
   Granted, it is small in comparison to the entire issue of college
   tuition costs, but this is something tangible we can get our hands on
   right now. With knowing what I know now about how the GOP want to
   funnel money in certain directions, I am incredibly angry. Please help
   fight this with me. I found this petition. I don't know if it will
   help, but I must try to do something

   [121]http://act.credoaction.com/campaign/reid_federal_student_loans/

   You know, these public schools are no longer "public". I saw a report
   that the Universities are accepting way more out of state tuition,
   because those students pay so much more, and the schools need the
   money. My son applied to UC Davis and UC Berkeley as well. We knew he
   probably wouldn't get in to Berkeley because he doesn't have a 4.0, but
   we (he especially) were hopeful about Davis. And I can't help but think
   if our economy was healthy he would of had a better chance to get in
   there. We are all so excited for him to go to Santa Cruz. I will work
   three jobs if I have to. Rachel, can you cover this some next week? I
   hear President Obama is going to start pushing on this next week at
   some Universities. We need all the help we can get. Thank you Rachel
   for all you do.

   Two thoughts:

   (1) If they could somehow extend the rate cut to mid-november (after
   the elections), I am pretty sure there would be bi-partisan support.
   The republican party will do anything to ensure that this adminstration
   is not successful on fufilling any of its promises.

   (2) Doesn't the republican party realize they are only increasing the
   amount of money that wil be necessary to bail out the banks and federal
   government when the student loan crisis hits? But then again, I should
   pobably see my first point.
