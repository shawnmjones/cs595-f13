   Doctors Without Borders relies on public support for two vital reasons:
     * To ensure the freedom to provide humanitarian assistance whenever
       and wherever it is needed.
     * To remain independent from political, religious and economic
       interests.

   Thank you for considering supporting our work. Your contribution is
   absolutely vital. Without public support, the valuable work of Doctors
   Without Borders Field Staff would be impossible. Just as importantly,
   your support demonstrates solidarity with the people Doctors Without
   Borders helps.
   By making a regular monthly donation and becoming a Doctors Without
   Borders Field Partner, your support can guarantee ongoing, regular
   income which is one of the most effective ways for us to plan our
   operations and respond quickly to emergencies while remaining flexible
   and independent.
   You can support our work by donating online today, or call our office
   at (212) 763-5779.
