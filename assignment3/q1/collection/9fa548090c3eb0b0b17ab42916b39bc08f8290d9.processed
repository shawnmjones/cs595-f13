   (CNN) -- In The World According to Dennis Rodman, North Korean leader
   Kim Jong Un, whom he just saw on his second trip to the country, is
   quite likable.

   "He has to do his job, but he's a very good guy," Rodman said Monday at
   a news conference, announcing plans for a "basketball diplomacy" event
   that will involve players from North Korea.

   Meanwhile, Kim presides over one of the most repressive regimes on
   Earth.

   Dennis Rodman\'s trips to North Korea Dennis Rodman's trips to North
   Korea

   People are subjected to torture and thrown into prison camps based on
   political charges. Those who have managed to escape describe horror
   that includes beatings, starvation and executions.
   Rodman to Obama: Let's talk
   Rodman's hoop dreams for North Korea
   The seven wackiest Rodman moments
   Rodman: Jailed American not my problem

   As [42]CNN has reported, Kim Jong Un appears to have changed nothing in
   the camps.

   U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae knows first-hand. [43]He's currently in one,
   charged with "serious crimes" and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor
   for allegedly trying to bring down the government through religious
   activities. Bae's family says he owned a tour company and was in North
   Korea for work.

   The accusations against him [44]were spelled out on state-run media,
   which is the only kind of media that "very good guy" Kim Jong Un and
   his country allow.

   [45]Bae from North Korean prison: Please help me

   Par for the course in North Korea, where people have no freedom.

   In 2012, "Defectors continued to report extrajudicial killings,
   disappearances, arbitrary detention, arrests of political prisoners,
   and torture," the [46]U.S. State Department Human Rights Report says.

   "The judiciary was not independent and did not provide fair trials.
   There continued to be reports of severe punishment of some repatriated
   refugees and their family members. There were reports of trafficked
   women among refugees and workers crossing the border into China.

   "The government made no known attempts to prosecute officials who
   committed human rights abuses."

   Meanwhile, much of the country starves.

   More than 25% of North Korean children under the age of 5 suffered from
   chronic malnutrition in 2012, according to the National Nutrition
   Survey of North Korea, a report backed by UNICEF, the World Food
   Program and the World Health Organization. The report also found nearly
   one in three women suffered from anemia.

   [47]The North Korea we rarely see

   Rodman: Come with me

   In The World According to Dennis Rodman, journalists would realize that
   his rosy description of Kim is really the right one, if only they'd go
   over there and see for themselves.

   "You write what you hear, but you don't see what you write," Rodman
   complained, saying he wants to bring a journalist on one of his trips
   to visit his friend.

   Yes, that's the problem, Mr. Rodman. North Korea is aching for
   journalists to roam freely around the country and report to the world
   what things are really like.

   "My military minder tells me to turn my camera off, and it soon becomes
   clear why," CNN's Paula Hancocks wrote last month [48]on a trip to the
   "hermit kingdom."

   "The poverty I see through the bus window is not the view of North
   Korea the regime wants to be seen. ... Buildings are in disrepair; some
   barely look inhabitable. Residents of this small town walk or sit by
   the side of the road, many seeming to have little to do. A number of
   official-looking men dressed in brown Mao suits stand silently on
   street corners. ... Despite the driver traveling as quickly as possible
   through these inhabited areas, you could still sense the local
   community being monitored."

   "It was a tightly restricted, carefully stage-managed tour rich with
   propaganda and political theater and little else," CNN's Ivan Watson
   [49]wrote in July of his five-day trip to Pyongyang. "It offered
   virtually no insight into what life is like for ordinary citizens who
   live in this rigid dictatorship."

   "We were not allowed to leave the confines of the Yanggakdo
   International Hotel unless we were riding a government bus. During my
   five days in North Korea, the authorities did not even allow me to see
   what the country's currency looks like."

   "Our three-man crew was assigned two very polite minders who
   accompanied us everywhere outside of the hotel and made no secret about
   the fact that they had veto rights if we were to take pictures of
   something that they didn't approve of," he added on CNN's [50]GPS blog.
   "So they would basically tell us what we could and could not take
   pictures of."

   Rodman: Kim just wants to talk

   In The World According to Dennis Rodman, Kim Jong Un just wants to
   talk.

   "It's about trying to open Obama's and everyone's minds," he said
   Monday, aiming some of his remarks at the U.S. president. "You don't
   have to talk about politics. ... Meet him or even give him a call.
   That's all he wants."

   Meanwhile, Kim might be [51]even more bellicose than his father was. On
   CNN's GPS blog, three analysts say an analysis of language used in the
   state-controlled Korean Central News Agency "shows the use of terms
   such as 'war' and 'nuclear' far more prevalent than terms such as
   'peace' and 'reconciliation.' "

   A U.S. defense official said North Korea has been using
   "[52]warmongering rhetoric."

   Rodman: I held Kim's daughter

   In The World According to Dennis Rodman, Kim opening "his heart and
   mind" and allowing Rodman to hold his daughter "for the first time in
   history" is something to celebrate.

   Never mind that the existence of said child has been shrouded in
   secrecy. North Korea's regime is so restrictive that even state media
   haven't mentioned the possibility [53]that their leader might have had
   a daughter.

   And speaking of children, Rodman shared an interesting detail Monday
   involving the "basketball diplomacy" event he's putting together with
   Paddy Power, an online betting company.

   "The marshall" -- the term Kim goes by -- "gave me anything I wanted,"
   he said. Kim told him, "We've got 150,000 kids will do anything for you
   on the field. We've got 95,000 people will be in the stadium watching
   this game."

   A dictator telling a foreign basketball player he can instruct 150,000
   kids, who will comply: In The World According to Dennis Rodman, that's
   a good thing.

   Still, reason for hope

   Any effort to, as Rodman says, "bridge a gap" with North Korea can be
   construed as a good thing.

   "I said to him, 'Your grandfather and your father did some bad things
   ... but you are trying to change,' " Rodman said at Monday's news
   conference.

   Kim has an "image" to keep up, he added.

   Maybe, one day, Kim Jong Un will knock down the walls behind which his
   country tries to hide its reality -- including the desperation, pain
   and horror described by defectors and refugees.

   [54]Struggling for survival, family tries to feed child mice

   But for now, Kim's propaganda machine [55]is ratcheting up, as CNN has
   reported.

   Rodman says Kim asked him to do one thing: "Tell the American people
   we're very cool."

   Mission accomplished, Mr. Rodman.
