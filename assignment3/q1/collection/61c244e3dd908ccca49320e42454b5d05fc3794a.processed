[22]Tucson group to give away shotguns, ammo in high-crime areas

   Arizona state flag
   Arizona, the bad idea state.
   [29]What could possibly go wrong?

     A Tucson, Arizona affiliate of the Armed Citizen Project will spend
     $12,000 on a new charitable initiative: handing out free shotguns in
     neighborhoods with high crime rates. According to the head of the
     Tucson initiative, an armed citizenry is the sensible solution to an
     underfunded police department facing budget cuts.

   The project is being spearheaded by failed mayoral candidate and local
   crackpot Shaun McClusky. Most non-crackpots [30]don't seem to be
   impressed:

     Councilwoman Regina Romero echoed Miller's sentiments and said
     McClusky is "stereotyping" south-side residents.

     She said Midvale is a "safe, beautiful neighborhood" and residents
     "don't need a gun to survive." [...]

     Councilman Steve Kozachik said he doesn't understand the logic
     behind the move.

     "To suggest that giving away ... loaded shotguns in high-crime areas
     will make anybody safer is pure idiocy," Kozachik said. "This is
     coming from a purported leader in the local Republican Party, the
     same group who last year auctioned off a Glock and a rifle as
     fundraisers. Now they're giving them away in our community? They're
     totally out of touch with the values of this city."

   That is a good question. Why isn't he doing this in his own
   neighborhood?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [49]Tagging tips - [50]Search For Tags - [51]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Or do the residents have to meet other criteria? Like being white?
   Maybe they'll want to check the resident's immigration status while
   they're handing out the shotguns. Oh, and just because they hate
   transpeople as well make sure their genitals match their birth
   certificate. Yeesh, when bad ideas intersect you put the AZ in crAZy.

   You can't assassinate the character of any of modern conservative.

   of homes & cars, capable of cracking engine blocks of vehicles, taking
   down big game animals, and even penetrating police body armor depending
   upon type of slug and propellant. Slugs are not a very smart choice for
   use in dense urban settings due to high probability of collateral
   damage. A slug will require more precise aiming than pellet shot shells
   and will fly farther retaining deadly force over longer distances.

   Why not 'defensive load' shot shells with BB sized or smaller pellets,
   birdshot even, that are less likely to go through walls, etc. and harm
   innocent bystanders, neighbors, etc.

   Hey BATF! Shouldn't a Federal Firearms License be required of the
   people passing out shotguns?  Shouldn't there be state or federal law
   enforcement present to ensure background checks are properly done?

 Defense ([453]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [454]LilithGardener

   What the NRA, and most of it's cronies, try to do is set up a gun as
   the best, last, line of defense against the masses that are trying to
   murder every good christian in the US.  Of course, they also have to
   fabricate the murdering masses because they don't exist.

   In reality there are much better ways to defend oneself than a gun.  It
   really is the difference between building security and adding it later
   as an afterthought.  Guns are mostly an afterthought.  Of a plan.  Go
   to a dangerous place and kill minorities.

   Of course in Texas the minorities are often in powerful positions, so
   shooting at one may mean trouble that would not happen in places like
   the midwest and north.

   I look at it this way.  The gun laws in the south are, on balance,
   little different than those in the north.  Vermont has laxer laws and
   most places. Connecticut has comparable laws, along with open carry.
   And if you ignore the unpleasantness in Waco, where an entire extended
   family committed suicide by cop, there simply has not been a case of 20
   children being murdered in one day.  The closest thing to that is
   Colorado, which is midwest, and the law enforcement seems happy to let
   people murder at will.

     McClusky said he's bringing the program to Tucson because the City

     many residents easy targets for criminals.

   This is what we can expect elsewhere. Republicans cut funding for the
   police, and later claim that armed citizens are necessary because the
   police can't protect them.

     The Armed Citizens Project was created recently by a master's
     student at the University of Houston as a way to measure whether
     more guns result in less crime. The plan is to have diverse cities
     across the nation implement the program in specific neighborhoods
     and then track those neighborhoods to see if crime is reduced.

   So.... sad to say, every experiment needs negative controls, and with
   something as lethal as a gun, no one can ethically do blind controls.

   Any experiment involving human subjects has to meet high standards for
   informed consent. How subjects are recruited / selected also has to
   meet standards.

   We should be pushing back against the University of Houston and find
   out which department approved this project.

   Recommended by the Vice President, in fact. Though please don't go
   firing them into the air- that's a crime.

   Large weapons, difficult to conceal. If used to fire birdshot, are
   lethal without risk of overpenetrating sheetrock. Inexpensive, and easy
   to maintain. Low capacity and short range.

   Why do you people have a problem with this, again? I, for one, think
   giving shotguns to those who otherwise couldn't afford them is a great

       Paranoia is, by definition, an irrational fear.
       However, firearms have been seized before, utilizing national
       registries. Many gun control advocates, admittedly back in the 90's
       when they had much looser lips, have advocated the confiscation of
       most weapons.
       Hell, Andrew Cuomo said confiscation was on the table just two
       months ago.
       How how are my misgivings in any way irrational? It's happened
       before, and many want it to happen again- here. And they've been

 *raises hand* Here's my problem with it ([970]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [971]LilithGardener, [972]tytalus, [973]TheDuckManCometh

   I grew up in one of these areas of Tucson.  (And I now live just a few
   miles east of there, in an OK but not great neighborhood.) We were the
   rare white family in the 12th & Drexel neighborhood.  Was there crime?
    Yes.  Were we constantly living in fear?  Oh hell no.  But we did have
   one thing stolen from the house in my 16 years there.

   It was my dad's shotgun. A friend of my brother's took it.  Feel safer
   yet?

   They are talking about introducing weapons into these neighborhoods to
   combat a problem that really doesn't exist.  They have this perception
   that people are getting robbed and assaulted on a regular basis.  It
   does happen, but I don't know a lot of people who it has happened to
   and I don't know anyone who feels like they need to keep a weapon in
   the house, who feels scared without one.

   Giving out these weapons, though, adds more guns into the mix, and some
   of these are going to be stolen or end up in the hands of kids.  We
   already know that more guns do not equal less crime - there are close
   to 300 million guns in the US, and 30,000 gun deaths each year.
   Compare that with European countries with effective gun control - the
   gun death rate isn't even close. This is a recipe for more dead people,
   more gun accidents, and more crime.  This isn't about preventing crime.
    It's about finding new ways to display a sick worship of guns.

       There's crime, but not that much crime. People are worried about

     However, the unique experiment has specific criteria for determining
     who can receive the weapons from the Armed Citizens Project. All
     recipients must first pass a background check and have lived in
     their current home for longer than one year. They must also pass a
     safety and tactical course offered by the group.
     ....
     The group is still analyzing data to determine which neighborhoods
     they will use for what is expected to be a year-long study.
     In addition to arming citizens, the group hopes to counter local gun
     buyback programs and instead educate those who want to give up their
     weapons with training sessions, or have those weapons traded in for
     20-gauge shotguns. "We want to reverse the flow of guns, to where
     they are flowing into a community, along with the necessary safety
     training and skills," the site states.

     Our founder, Kyle Coplen, is a policy analyst in his final semester
     of the Masters of Public Administration program with the University
     of Houston.  Tired of the blatant manipulation and politicization of
     statistics when it comes to the relationship between firearms and
     safety, Kyle decided to conduct a multi-year, multi-city study that
     may be able to establish the definitive link that the gun debate is
     sorely lacking.

   Interesting news today about Jared Loughner, who shot Gabrielle
   Giffords.

     Randy Loughner said his son felt harassed by campus police, who came
     to the Loughner home and asked if there were any firearms in the
     house. Loughner had bought a 12-gauge shotgun in 2008; at the
     recommendation of Pima Community College campus police, who
     recommended any firearms be taken away, they hid the shotgun and an
     antique weapon they owned.

   Did you get that?   Once again, the campus police knew about a shooter
   before a shooting.  Campus police knew enough about Jared Loughner to
   determine that he was a threat to others, to the point that they asked
   his parents to lock up their guns.   So why wasn't he committed?

   What do you know?   They were right.    Too bad we didn't have
   procedures in place to take advantage of their foresight in time to
   save Gabby Giffords.

   This is eerily similar to what happened with James Holmes.   The
   psychiatrist that he was seeing reported the concern that he was a
   danger to others, to the campus police.

   Again -- the campus police had information or reasonable suspicion that
   a person is a threat to others, but took no action to attempt to have
   the person taken into custody for a 72 hour hold.

   In both cases, campus police knew or suspected the person was a danger
   to others, and yet, the threat was not dealt with, and people were
   injured or killed as a result.   This is not rocket science.   If these
   people had died after a 911 call, someone would demand answers.
   People died after police were informed or aware that a person was a
   danger to others.

   Both of these two are reported to have been under psychiatric
   treatment.  They are victims, too.  Our community failed to provide the
   protection and treatment they needed, and tragedy resulted for them and
   for their victims.

   If you truly think a person might shoot someone, don't just lock up the
   guns.   LOCK UP THE POTENTIAL SHOOTER.  Get him some help.

   There will be more documents released soon on the Adam Lanza case.  I
   will be interested to hear if there were any doctors or police who were
   aware or concerned that he was a danger to others.

   It is time to look very carefully at exactly what campus police should
   do in the case that a person is suspected of being a danger to himself
   or others.   Recent events suggest that current policies are
   inadequate, and the entire process needs an overhaul, in a manner
   similar to the way that child abductions are now handled in a different
   manner, which Amber Alerts and coordination between departments.  By
   the time that a community starts to get the suspicion that one of its
   own might be dangerous, very little time may be left.  These reports
   should be treated like 911 calls.

   We need to start taking these reports seriously.  Maybe, we could call
   it The Gabby Alert.

       Thank you for sharing that information.
       I really feel that this issue of how police respond to a report
       that a person is a danger to others, particularly campus police, is
       a critical piece of this puzzle.  If we could crack that nut, it
       could make a real difference.
       This issue lies, as most difficult issues do, at the intersection
       of personal civil rights, and the over-riding public interest to
       keep people safe from dangerous persons.   We had a pendulum swing
       towards personal civil rights in the last few decades that has
       resulted in a situation where, when a person is recognized by
       authorities  or persons in the community as a danger to others, the
       response is ineffective.     We must empower authorities to act
       when they suspect a person may shoot or otherwise harm another
       individual.  This has bearing on violence against women, as well.
       It is all part of the same puzzle.

       Off the cuff, what I see as an obvious piece of this is due legal
       process, which means some form of court order by a judge.  Cops get
       warrants all the time and in these cases it sounds like there was
       sufficient time for them to go through such procedures.  The
       important part would be oversight and process review and not
       leaving the decision completely in the hands of the LE officers.
       There would also need to be a way to expediently rectify any
       mistakes as well as safe guards to prevent (false) accusations from
       being used to deny rights in the future.

   I say "group," because I suspect there is something organized about

   he is going to do all this and, well, the money would just come to him
   somehow.

     A University of Houston graduate student says he's conducting a
     study to hopefully answer the question being asked across the
     country, "Do more guns reduce crime or not?"

     Kyle Coplen, who founded the Armed Citizens Project, is giving away
     20-gauge single-shot shotguns to residents in mid- and high-crime
     neighborhoods to test whether or not the weapon will help reduce
     crime in the area,

   Since this is popping up in other places, doesn't this sound like
   another fake "grassroots" effort by the far right?

   Sorta like the grassroots "Tea Party" was started by Dick Armey and the
   Koch bros?

   Where Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by an armed killer while
   peacefully walking home at night after a trip to the 7-11.  If he and
   all young black youths like him in Sanford, Florida, were armed, that
   might have gone down differently!

   I've suggested this before.  Considering the danger to young black
   youths from armed white killers in Florida who believe that they have
   the support of people like Rush Limbaugh, we need a program to arm
   them, more than we need a program in Tucson.

   Let's get it going.  In fact, maybe after we get it started, we can bus
   a bunch of newly armed Sanford citizenry to Tucson to walk the streets
   at night, making it safer there, as well.

       emmigration to Mexico in the mid-1800s, this is not surprising.
       My father-in-law's mother's maiden name was Holmann. She crosed the
       border into San Diego in the 1920s, just ahead of the revolutionary
       hit squads... her family was wealthy Spanish / German... little
       native blood.
       My FiL looks more like a Spaniard than a "Mexican".
       To the original point, though... the Martin shooting simply doesn't
       fit neatly into the black / white racial narrative... although
       there has been plenty of shoving and pushing to try to make it fit
       that box.
       And, of course, Latino vs black racism isn't news to anybody who
       grew up poor in Southern California. The shooting of Trayvon Martin
       may well have been racially motivated, but George Zimmerman doesn't
       have to be white for that to be true. Racism in the real world

 Now there's a good logical idea...... ([1320]0+ / 0-)

   You have a high crime neighborhood.  Chances are residents of the
   neighborhood are committing most of the crimes. So arming the criminals
   makes a lot of sense.......

 can we get a list of where you get free guns ([1323]0+ / 0-)

   To match up with a list of where you can get cash to surrender them in
   to be melted down? If no one objects, i'd like to try that. (I'm real
   broke.) Not unethical, is it? Legal? Fair? If it catches on, could
   steer funds to kossacktivist charities.
