The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal

   June 27, 2012: 5:00 AM ET

A Fortune investigation reveals that the ATF never intentionally allowed guns
to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. How the world came to believe
just the opposite is a tale of rivalry, murder, and political bloodlust.

   Dave Voth, Fast and Furious supervisor for the ATF

   FORTUNE -- In the annals of impossible assignments, Dave Voth's ranked
   high. In 2009 the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
   Explosives promoted Voth to lead Phoenix Group VII, one of seven new
   ATF groups along the Southwest border tasked with stopping guns from
   being trafficked into Mexico's vicious drug war.

   Some call it the "parade of ants"; others the "river of iron." The
   Mexican government has estimated that 2,000 weapons are smuggled daily
   from the U.S. into Mexico. The ATF is hobbled in its effort to stop
   this flow. No federal statute outlaws firearms trafficking within the
   U.S., so agents must build cases using a patchwork of often toothless
   laws. For six years, due to Beltway politics, the bureau has gone
   without permanent leadership, neutered in its fight for funding and
   authority. The National Rifle Association has so successfully opposed a
   comprehensive electronic database of gun sales that the ATF's
   congressional appropriation explicitly prohibits establishing one.

   Voth, 39, was a good choice for a Sisyphean task. Strapping and
   sandy-haired, the former Marine is cool-headed and punctilious to a
   fault. In 2009 the ATF named him outstanding law-enforcement employee
   of the year for dismantling two violent street gangs in Minneapolis. He
   was the "hardest working federal agent I've come across," says John
   Biederman, a sergeant with the Minneapolis Police Department. But as
   Voth left to become the group supervisor of Phoenix Group VII, a friend
   warned him: "You're destined to fail."

   Voth's mandate was to stop gun traffickers in Arizona, the state ranked
   by the gun-control advocacy group Legal Community Against Violence as
   having the nation's "weakest gun violence prevention laws." Just 200
   miles from Mexico, which prohibits gun sales, the Phoenix area is home
   to 853 federally licensed firearms dealers. Billboards advertise volume
   discounts for multiple purchases.

   Customers can legally buy as many weapons as they want in Arizona as
   long as they're 18 or older and pass a criminal background check. There
   are no waiting periods and no need for permits, and buyers are allowed
   to resell the guns. "In Arizona," says Voth, "someone buying three guns
   is like someone buying a sandwich."

   By 2009 the Sinaloa drug cartel had made Phoenix its gun supermarket
   and recruited young Americans as its designated shoppers or straw
   purchasers. Voth and his agents began investigating a group of buyers,
   some not even old enough to buy beer, whose members were plunking down
   as much as $20,000 in cash to purchase up to 20 semiautomatics at a
   time, and then delivering the weapons to others.

   The agents faced numerous obstacles in what they dubbed the Fast and
   Furious case. (They named it after the street-racing movie because the
   suspects drag raced cars together.) Their greatest difficulty by far,
   however, was convincing prosecutors that they had sufficient grounds to
   seize guns and arrest straw purchasers. By June 2010 the agents had
   sent the U.S. Attorney's office a list of 31 suspects they wanted to
   arrest, with 46 pages outlining their illegal acts. But for the next
   seven months prosecutors did not indict a single suspect.

   On Dec. 14, 2010, a tragic event rewrote the narrative of the
   investigation. In a remote stretch of Peck Canyon, Ariz., Mexican
   bandits attacked an elite U.S. Border Patrol unit and killed an agent
   named Brian Terry. The attackers fled, leaving behind two semiautomatic
   rifles. A trace of the guns' serial numbers revealed that the weapons
   had been purchased 11 months earlier at a Phoenix-area gun store by a
   Fast and Furious suspect.

   Ten weeks later, an ATF agent named John Dodson, whom Voth had
   supervised, made startling allegations on the CBS Evening News. He
   charged that his supervisors had intentionally allowed American
   firearms to be trafficked--a tactic known as "walking guns"--to Mexican
   drug cartels. Dodson claimed that supervisors repeatedly ordered him
   not to seize weapons because they wanted to track the guns into the
   hands of criminal ringleaders. The program showed internal e-mails from
   Voth, which purportedly revealed agents locked in a dispute over the
   deadly strategy. The guns permitted to flow to criminals, the program
   charged, played a role in Terry's death.

   After the CBS broadcast, Fast and Furious erupted as a major scandal
   for the Obama administration. The story has become a fixture on Fox
   News and the subject of numerous reports in media outlets from CNN to
   the New York Times. The furor has prompted repeated congressional
   hearings--with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder testifying multiple
   times--dueling reports from congressional committees, and an ongoing
   investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general. It has led
   to the resignations of the acting ATF chief, the U.S. Attorney in
   Arizona, and his chief criminal prosecutor.

   Rep. Darrell Issa (R.-Calif.)

   Conservatives have pummeled the Obama administration, and especially
   Holder, for more than a year. "Who authorized this program that was so
   felony stupid that it got people killed?" Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.),
   chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,
   demanded to know in a hearing in June 2011. He has charged the Justice
   Department, which oversees the ATF, with having "blood on their hands."
   Issa and more than 100 other Republican members of Congress have
   demanded Holder's resignation.

   The conflict has escalated dramatically in the past ten days. On June
   20, in a day of political brinkmanship, Issa's committee voted along
   party lines, 23 to 17, to hold Holder in contempt of Congress for
   allegedly failing to turn over certain subpoenaed documents, which the
   Justice Department contended could not be released because they related
   to ongoing criminal investigations. The vote came hours after President
   Obama asserted executive privilege to block the release of the
   documents. Holder now faces a vote by the full House of Representatives
   this week on the contempt motion (though negotiations over the
   documents continue). Assuming a vote occurs, it will be the first
   against an attorney general in U.S. history.

   As political pressure has mounted, ATF and Justice Department officials
   have reversed themselves. After initially supporting Group VII agents
   and denying the allegations, they have since agreed that the ATF
   purposefully chose not to interdict guns it lawfully could have seized.
   Holder testified in December that "the use of this misguided tactic is
   inexcusable, and it must never happen again."

   There's the rub.

   Quite simply, there's a fundamental misconception at the heart of the
   Fast and Furious scandal. Nobody disputes that suspected straw
   purchasers under surveillance by the ATF repeatedly bought guns that
   eventually fell into criminal hands. Issa and others charge that the
   ATF intentionally allowed guns to walk as an operational tactic. But
   five law-enforcement agents directly involved in Fast and Furious tell
   Fortune that the ATF had no such tactic. They insist they never
   purposefully allowed guns to be illegally trafficked. Just the
   opposite: They say they seized weapons whenever they could but were
   hamstrung by prosecutors and weak laws, which stymied them at every
   turn.

   Indeed, a six-month Fortune investigation reveals that the public case
   alleging that Voth and his colleagues walked guns is replete with
   distortions, errors, partial truths, and even some outright lies.
   Fortune reviewed more than 2,000 pages of confidential ATF documents
   and interviewed 39 people, including seven law-enforcement agents with
   direct knowledge of the case. Several, including Voth, are speaking out
   for the first time.

   How Fast and Furious reached the headlines is a strange and unsettling
   saga, one that reveals a lot about politics and media today. It's a
   story that starts with a grudge, specifically Dodson's anger at Voth.
   After the terrible murder of agent Terry, Dodson made complaints that
   were then amplified, first by right-wing bloggers, then by CBS. Rep.
   Issa and other politicians then seized those elements to score points
   against the Obama administration, which, for its part, has capitulated
   in an apparent effort to avoid a rhetorical battle over gun control in
   the run-up to the presidential election. (A Justice Department
   spokesperson denies this and asserts that the department is not drawing
   conclusions until the inspector general's report is submitted.)

   "Republican senators are whipping up the country into a psychotic
   frenzy with these reports that are patently false," says Linda Wallace,
   a special agent with the Internal Revenue Service's criminal
   investigation unit who was assigned to the Fast and Furious team (and
   recently retired from the IRS). A self-described gun-rights supporter,
   Wallace has not been criticized by Issa's committee.

   The ATF's accusers seem untroubled by evidence that the policy they
   have pilloried didn't actually exist. "It gets back to something basic
   for me," says Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa). "Terry was murdered, and
   guns from this operation were found at his murder site." A spokesman
   for Issa denies that politics has played a role in the congressman's
   actions and says "multiple individuals across the Justice Department's
   component agencies share responsibility for the failure that occurred
   in Operation Fast and Furious." Issa's spokesman asserts that even if
   ATF agents followed prosecutors' directives, "the practice is
   nonetheless gun walking." Attorneys for Dodson declined to comment on
   the record.

   For its part, the ATF would not answer specific questions, citing
   ongoing investigations. But a spokesperson for the agency provided a
   written statement noting that the "ATF did not exercise proper
   oversight, planning or judgment in executing this case. We at ATF have
   accepted responsibility and have taken appropriate and decisive action
   to insure that these errors in oversight and judgment never occur
   again." The statement asserted that the "ATF has clarified its firearms
   transfer policy to focus on interdiction or early intervention to
   prevent the criminal acquisition, trafficking and misuse of firearms,"
   and it cited changes in coordination and oversight at the ATF.

   Irony abounds when it comes to the Fast and Furious scandal. But the
   ultimate irony is this: Republicans who support the National Rifle
   Association and its attempts to weaken gun laws are lambasting ATF
   agents for not seizing enough weapons--ones that, in this case,
   prosecutors deemed to be legal.

   The investigation begins

   The ATF is a bureau of judgment calls. Drug enforcement agents can
   confiscate cocaine and arrest anyone in possession of it. But ATF
   agents must distinguish constitutionally protected legal guns from
   illegal ones, with the NRA and other Second Amendment activists
   watching for missteps.

   Critics have depicted the ATF as "jackbooted government thugs"
   trampling on the rights of law-abiding gun owners. From the deadly
   standoff with the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas, in 1993 to
   allegations that ATF agents illegally seized weapons from suspected
   straw purchasers at a Richmond  gun show in 2005, these scandals have
   helped cement the bureau's reputation in some quarters for
   law-enforcement overreach.

   In part because of these notorious cases, the bureau has operated in a
   self-protective crouch. It has stuck to small single-defendant cases to
   the detriment of its effort to combat gun trafficking, the Justice
   Department's inspector general found in a review of ATF cases from 2007
   to 2009. To refocus its efforts, the ATF established Group VII and the
   other Southwest border units to build big, multi-defendant conspiracy
   cases and target the leaders of the trafficking operations.

   Of course, the ATF can be its own worst enemy. Voth arrived in Phoenix
   in December 2009 only to discover that his group had not been funded.
   The group had little equipment and no long guns, electronic devices, or
   binoculars, forcing Voth to scrounge for supplies.

   Then there was Voth's seven-agent team, which was almost instantly at
   war with itself. Most of the agents were transplants, unfamiliar with
   Arizona or one another. Fast and Furious' lead case agent, Hope
   MacAllister, 41, was the exception--a tough, squared-away Phoenix
   veteran with little tolerance for complaints. Her unsmiling demeanor
   led Voth to give her the ironic nickname "Sunshine Bear." She declined
   to be interviewed.

   Dodson, 41, arrived one day before Voth from a two-man outpost of ATF's
   Roanoke field office, where he'd worked since 2002. He had joined the
   ATF from the narcotics section of the Loudoun County sheriff's office
   in Virginia, where his blunt, even obnoxious manner did not earn him
   friends. He's "an asshole sometimes--there is no other way to put it,"
   says his former partner, Ken Dondero, who served as best man at
   Dodson's wedding. "He's almost too honest. He believes that if he has a
   thought in his head, it's there to broadcast to everyone."

   Voth, MacAllister, and a third agent, Tonya English, were
   quintessential by-the-book types. By contrast, Dodson and two other new
   arrivals, Olindo "Lee" Casa and Lawrence Alt, seemed to chafe at ATF
   rules and procedures. (An attorney for Casa says that "in light of the
   current congressional investigation, as well as investigations by the
   Department of Justice Inspector General and the Office of Special
   Counsel" it would be premature to comment. A lawyer for Alt says Alt
   could not be interviewed because he is in mediation to settle a suit he
   filed in which he charges that he was retaliated against for being a
   whistleblower.)

   Dodson's faction grew antagonistic to Voth. They regularly fired off
   snide e-mails and seemed to delight in mocking Voth and his methodical
   nature. They were scornful of protocol, according to ATF agents. Dodson
   would show up to work in flip-flops. He came unprepared for
   operations--without safety equipment or back-up plans--and was pulled
   off at least one surveillance for his own safety, say two colleagues.
   He earned the nickname "Renegade," and soon Voth's group effectively
   divided into two clashing factions: the Sunshine Bears and the
   Renegades.

   Even had they all gotten along, they faced a nearly impossible task.
   They were seven agents pursuing more than a dozen cases, of which Fast
   and Furious was just one, their efforts complicated by a lack of
   adequate tools. Without a real-time database of gun sales, they had to
   perform a laborious archaeology. Day after day, they visited local gun
   dealers and pored over forms called 4473s, which dealers must keep on
   file. These contain a buyer's personal information, a record of
   purchased guns and their serial numbers, and a certification that the
   buyer is purchasing the guns for himself. (Lying on the forms is a
   felony, but with weak penalties attached.) The ATF agents manually
   entered these serial numbers into a database of suspect guns to help
   them build a picture of past purchases.

   By January 2010 the agents had identified 20 suspects who had paid some
   $350,000 in cash for more than 650 guns. According to Rep. Issa's
   congressional committee, Group VII had enough evidence to make arrests
   and close the case then.

   Prosecutors: Transferring guns is legal in Arizona

   This was not the view of federal prosecutors. In a meeting on Jan. 5,
   2010, Emory Hurley, the assistant U.S. Attorney in Phoenix overseeing
   the Fast and Furious case, told the agents they lacked probable cause
   for arrests, according to ATF records. Hurley's judgment reflected
   accepted policy at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona. "[P]urchasing
   multiple long guns in Arizona is lawful," Patrick Cunningham, the U.S.
   Attorney's then-criminal chief in Arizona would later write.
   "Transferring them to another is lawful and even sale or barter of the
   guns to another is lawful unless the United States can prove by clear
   and convincing evidence that the firearm is intended to be used to
   commit a crime." (Arizona federal prosecutors referred requests for
   comment to the Justice Department, which declined to make officials
   available. Hurley noted in an e-mail, "I am not able to comment on what
   I understand to be an ongoing investigation/prosecution. I am precluded
   by federal regulation, DOJ policy, the rules of professional conduct,
   and court order from talking with you about this matter." Cunningham's
   attorney also declined to comment.)

   It was nearly impossible in Arizona to bring a case against a straw
   purchaser. The federal prosecutors there did not consider the purchase
   of a huge volume of guns, or their handoff to a third party,
   sufficient evidence to seize them. A buyer who certified that the guns
   were for himself, then handed them off minutes later, hadn't
   necessarily lied and was free to change his mind. Even if a suspect
   bought 10 guns that were recovered days later at a Mexican crime scene,
   this didn't mean the initial purchase had been illegal. To these
   prosecutors, the pattern proved little. Instead, agents needed to link
   specific evidence of intent to commit a crime to each gun they wanted
   to seize.

   None of the ATF agents doubted that the Fast and Furious guns were
   being purchased to commit crimes in Mexico. But that was nearly
   impossible to prove to prosecutors' satisfaction. And agents could not
   seize guns or arrest suspects after being directed not to do so by a
   prosecutor. (Agents can be sued if they seize a weapon against
   prosecutors' advice. In this case, the agents had a particularly strong
   obligation to follow the prosecutors' direction given that Fast and
   Furious had received a special designation under the Justice
   Department's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. That
   designation meant more resources for the case, but it also provided
   that prosecutors take the lead role.)

   In their Jan. 5 meeting, Hurley suggested another way to make a case:
   Voth's team could wiretap the phone of a suspected recruiter and
   capture proof of him directing straw purchasers to buy guns. This would
   establish sufficient proof to arrest both the leaders and the
   followers.

   On Jan. 8, 2010, Voth and his supervisors drafted a briefing paper in
   which they explained Hurley's view that "there was minimal evidence at
   this time to support any type of prosecution." The paper elaborated,
   "Currently our strategy is to allow the transfer of firearms to
   continue to take place, albeit at a much slower pace, in order to
   further the investigation and allow for the identification of
   additional co-conspirators."

   Rep. Issa's committee has flagged this document as proof that the
   agents chose to walk guns. But prosecutors had determined, Voth says,
   that the "transfer of firearms" was legal. Agents had no choice but to
   keep investigating and start a wiretap as quickly as possible to gather
   evidence of criminal intent.

   Ten days after the meeting with Hurley, a Saturday, Jaime Avila, a
   transient, admitted methamphetamine user, bought three WASR-10 rifles
   at the Lone Wolf Trading Company in Glendale, Ariz. The next day, a
   helpful Lone Wolf employee faxed Avila's purchase form to ATF to flag
   the suspicious activity. It was the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday
   weekend, so the agents didn't receive the fax until Tuesday, according
   to a contemporaneous case report. By that time, the legally purchased
   guns had been gone for three days. The agents had never seen the
   weapons and had no chance to seize them. But they entered the serial
   numbers into their gun database. Two of these were later recovered at
   Brian Terry's murder scene.

   Rebuffed by the prosecutors

   Voth was a logical thinker. He lived by advice he received from an
   early mentor in law enforcement: "There's what you think. There's what
   you know. There's what you can prove. And the first two don't count."

   But he was not operating in a logical world. The wiretap represented
   the ATF's best--perhaps only-- hope of connecting the gun purchases it
   had been documenting to orders from the cartels, according to Hurley.
   In Minneapolis, the prosecutors Voth had worked with had approved
   wiretap applications within 24 hours. But in Phoenix, days turned into
   weeks, and Group VII's wiretap application languished with prosecutors
   in Arizona and Washington, D.C.

   No one has yet explained this delay. Voth thinks prosecutor Hurley's
   inexperience in wiretapping cases may have slowed the process. Several
   other agents speculate that Arizona's gun culture may have led to
   indifference. Hurley is an avid gun enthusiast, according to two
   law-enforcement sources who worked with him. One of those sources says
   he saw Hurley behind the counter at a gun show, helping a friend who is
   a weapons dealer.

   William Newell, then special agent in charge of the ATF's Phoenix field
   division, suspected that U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke, an Obama
   appointee, was not being briefed adequately by deputies about the
   volume of guns being purchased. He wrote to colleagues in February 2010
   that the prosecutor seemed "taken aback by some of the facts I informed
   him about"--by then, the Fast and Furious suspects had purchased 800
   guns--"so I am setting up a briefing for him (alone no USAO 'posse')
   about this case and several other cases I feel he is being misled
   about."

   The conflict between federal prosecutors and ATF agents had been
   growing for years. Pete Forcelli, who served as group supervisor of
   ATF's Phoenix I field division for five years, told Congress in June
   2011 that he believed Arizona federal prosecutors made up excuses to
   decline cases. "Despite the existence [of] probable cause in many
   cases," he testified, "there were no indictments, no prosecutions, and
   criminals were allowed to walk free." Prosecutors in Los Angeles and
   New York were far more aggressive in pursuing gun cases, Forcelli
   asserted.

   Phoenix-based ATF agents became so frustrated by prosecutors'
   intransigence that, in a highly unusual move, they began bringing big
   cases to the state attorney general's office instead. Terry Goddard,
   Arizona's Attorney General from 2003 to 2011, says of federal
   prosecutors, "They demanded that every i be dotted, every t be crossed,
   and after a while, it got to be nonsensical."

   For prosecutors, straw-purchasing cases were hard to prove and
   unrewarding to prosecute, with minimal penalties attached. In December
   2010, five U.S. Attorneys along the Southwest border, including Burke
   in Arizona, wrote to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, asking that
   penalties for straw purchasing be increased. The commission did
   increase the recommended jail time by a few months. But because the
   straw purchasers, by definition, have no criminal record and there is
   no firearms-trafficking statute that would allow prosecutors to charge
   them with conspiracy as a group, the penalties remain low.

   Prosecutors repeatedly rebuffed Voth's requests. After examining one
   suspect's garbage, agents learned he was on food stamps yet had plunked
   down more than $300,000 for 476 firearms in six months. Voth asked if
   the ATF could arrest him for fraudulently accepting public assistance
   when he was spending such huge sums. Prosecutor Hurley said no. In
   another instance, a young jobless suspect paid more than $10,000 for a
   50-caliber tripod-mounted sniper rifle. According to Voth, Hurley told
   the agents they lacked proof that he hadn't bought the gun for himself.

   Voth grew deeply frustrated. In August 2010, after the ATF in Texas
   confiscated 80 guns--63 of them purchased in Arizona by the Fast and
   Furious suspects-- Voth got an e-mail from a colleague there: "Are you
   all planning to stop some of these guys any time soon? That's a lot of
   guns...Are you just letting these guns walk?"

   Voth responded with barely suppressed rage: "Have I offended you in
   some way? Because I am very offended by your e-mail. Define walk?
   Without Probable Cause and concurrence from the USAO [U.S. Attorney's
   Office] it is highway robbery if we take someone's property." He then
   recounted the situation with the unemployed suspect who had bought the
   sniper rifle. "We conducted a field interview and after calling the
   AUSA [assistant U.S. Attorney] he said we did not have sufficient PC
   [probable cause] to take the firearm so our suspect drove home with
   said firearm in his car...any ideas on how we could not let that
   firearm 'walk'"?

   Voth believed the wiretap could help bring the case to a swift and
   successful close. On March 5, 2010, ten days before their first wiretap
   was set to begin, Voth was in Washington, D.C., to brief ATF brass and
   Justice Department officials on Fast and Furious. The response was
   overwhelmingly positive. A senior ATF attorney wrote Voth, "This is
   exactly the types of cases ATF should be doing with a wire, it is
   fantastic."

   The schism inside Phoenix Group VII

   Voth returned to Phoenix fully expecting his team to unite for the work
   that lay ahead. But instead he found a minor mutiny--over the schedule
   for the wire, which needed to be monitored around the clock. Dodson
   didn't want to work weekends. Casa felt his seniority should exclude
   him from the effort.

   Agents were getting pulled from other field offices to assist, and on
   March 11, one wrote to ask Voth, "You're not going to give the
   out-of-towners the crappy shifts, are you?" Voth responded, "I am
   attempting to split the weekends so everyone has to work one of the two
   days that way no one gets screwed too hard and everybody gets screwed a
   little bit."

   The next day, March 12, Voth sent out the wire schedule at 5:15 p.m.
   but got such a blizzard of complaints about the shifts that, two hours
   later, he sent another e-mail to the group. It read in part: "[T]here
   may be a schism developing amongst the group. This is the time we all
   need to pull together not drift apart. We are all entitled to our
   respective (albeit different) opinions however we all need to get along
   and realize we have a mission to accomplish. I am thrilled and proud
   that our Group is the first ATF Southwest Border Group in the country
   to be going up on [a] wire...I will be damned if this case is going to
   suffer due to petty arguing, rumors or other adolescent behavior...I
   don't know what all the issues are but we are all adults, we are all
   professionals, and we have an exciting opportunity to use the biggest
   tool in our law enforcement tool box. If you don't think this is fun
   you're in the wrong line of work--period! This is the pinnacle of
   domestic U.S. law-enforcement techniques. After this the tool box is
   empty."

   The wire turned out to be short lived. Within days, the agents realized
   that their suspect was phasing out use of the phone they were
   monitoring. Group VII would have to reapply, all over again, for
   permission to tap the new phone number.

   But Voth's so-called "schism e-mail" would live in infamy. Today it is
   held up as proof that the group was desperately divided over the tactic
   of gun walking and that Voth belittled those who opposed it. But there
   is no documentary evidence that agents Dodson, Casa, or Alt complained
   to their supervisors about the alleged gun walking, had confrontations
   about it, or were retaliated against because of their complaints, as
   they all later claimed.

   Who's opposed to gun walking?

   The atmosphere inside Voth's group had become toxic. The subjects of
   dispute were often trivial. For example, when Voth asked Casa to turn
   off his computer's Godzilla sound effect, which roared each time he got
   an e-mail, Casa replied, "I have done some limited research and have
   found no ATF order or internal division memo addressing this issue."

   Voth remained even-tempered but did take a stand after one incident.
   Alt taped to Voth's door an eight-point takedown of agent MacAllister,
   sarcastically stating that she was in charge of everything. Voth
   reported the note to an ATF attorney, and Alt apologized. It's unclear
   what drove the men's anger, but it seems unlikely that it was caused by
   disagreements over alleged gun walking.

   How is it possible to deduce that? Because Dodson then proceeded to
   walk guns intentionally, with Casa and Alt's help. On April 13, 2010,
   one month after Voth wrote his schism e-mail, Dodson opened a case into
   a suspected gun trafficker named Isaiah Fernandez. He had gotten Casa
   to approve the case when Voth was on leave. Dodson had directed a
   cooperating straw purchaser to give three guns to Fernandez and had
   taped their conversations without a prosecutor's approval.

   Voth first learned these details a month into the case. He demanded
   that Dodson meet with him and get approval from prosecutors to tape
   conversations. Five days later, Dodson sent an uncharacteristically
   diplomatic response. (He and Alt had revised repeated drafts in that
   time, with Alt pushing to make the reply "less abrasive." Dodson
   e-mailed back: "Less abrasive? I felt sick from kissing all that ass as
   it was.") Dodson wrote that he succeeded in posing undercover as a
   straw purchaser and claimed that prosecutor Hurley--who he had just
   belatedly contacted--had raised "new concerns." The prosecutor had told
   Dodson that an assistant U.S. Attorney "won't be able to approve of
   letting firearms 'walk' in furtherance of your investigation without
   first briefing the U.S. Attorney and Criminal Chief."

   It was the first time Voth learned that Dodson intended to walk guns.
   Voth says he refused to approve the plan and instead consulted his
   supervisor, who asked for a proposal from Dodson in writing. Dodson
   then drafted one, which Voth forwarded to his supervisor, who approved
   it on May 28.

   On June 1, Dodson used $2,500 in ATF funds to purchase six AK Draco
   pistols from local gun dealers, and gave these to Fernandez, who
   reimbursed him and gave him $700 for his efforts. Two days later,
   according to case records, Dodson--who would later testify that in his
   previous experience, "if even one [gun] got away from us, nobody went
   home until we found it"--left on a scheduled vacation without
   interdicting the guns. That day, Voth wrote to remind him that money
   collected as evidence needed to be vouchered within five days. Dodson
   e-mailed back, his sarcasm fully restored: "Do the orders define a
   'day'? Is it; a calendar day? A business day or work day....? An Earth
   day (because a day on Venus takes 243 Earth days which would mean that
   I have plenty of time)?"

   The guns were never recovered, the case was later closed, and Fernandez
   was never charged. By any definition, it was gun walking of the most
   egregious sort: a government agent using taxpayer money to deliver guns
   to bad guys and then failing to intercept them.

   On Feb. 4, 2011, the Justice Department sent a letter to Sen. Grassley
   saying that the allegations of gun walking in Fast and Furious were
   false and that ATF always tried to interdict weapons. A month later,
   Grassley countered with what appeared to be slam-dunk proof that ATF
   had indeed walked guns. "[P]lease explain how the denials in the
   Justice Department's Feb. 4, 2011 letter to me can be squared with the
   evidence," Grassley wrote, attaching damning case reports that he
   contended "proved that ATF allowed guns to 'walk.'" The case and agent
   names were redacted, but the reports were not from Fast and Furious.
   They came entirely from Dodson's Fernandez case.

   An unusual alliance

   By the end of July 2010, the Fast and Furious investigation was largely
   complete. The agents had sent prosecutors 20 names for immediate
   indictment, Jaime Avila's among them. His purchase of the three
   WASR-10s were listed among his criminal acts. On Aug. 17, 2010, ATF
   agents met in Phoenix with prosecutors, including U.S. Attorney Dennis
   Burke. According to two people present, the ATF presented detailed
   evidence, including the fact that their suspects had purchased almost
   2,000 guns, and pushed for indictments. A month later, on Sept. 17, an
   ATF team--this time including ATF director Kenneth Melson--met with
   prosecutors again and again pushed for action. The sides agreed to aim
   for indictments by October, according to one person in attendance.

   But as weeks and then months passed, prosecutors did not issue
   indictments. The ATF agents grew increasingly concerned. By December,
   prosecutors had dropped Avila's name from the indictment list for what
   they deemed a lack of evidence.

   Only when Terry, the U.S. Border Patrol agent, was murdered in December
   2010 did the prosecutors act. Voth's agents arrested Avila within 24
   hours of Terry's death. On Jan. 19, 2011, a federal grand jury indicted
   him and 19 other suspects. (Avila has since pleaded guilty to dealing
   guns without a license).

   Meanwhile, a crucial part of the Fast and Furious scandal--an unusual
   alliance that would prod politicians and spread word of the failure to
   stop guns from making their way to Mexican drug cartels--was waiting in
   the wings. Little more than a week after Terry's murder, a small item
   about the possible connection between his death and the Fast and
   Furious case appeared on a website, CleanUpATF.org. The site was the
   work of a disgruntled ATF agent-turned-whistleblower, Vince Cefalu, who
   is suing the bureau for alleged mistreatment in an unrelated case. His
   website has served as a clearinghouse for grievances and a magnet for
   other ATF whistleblowers.

   It had also attracted gun-rights activists loosely organized around a
   blog called the Sipsey Street Irregulars, run by a former militia
   member, Mike Vanderboegh, who has advocated armed insurrection against
   the U.S. government. It was an incendiary combination: the disgruntled
   ATF agents wanted to punish and reform the bureau; the gun-rights
   activists wanted to disable it. After the item about Terry appeared,
   the bloggers funneled the allegations through a "desert telegraph" of
   sorts to Republican lawmakers, who began asking questions.

   A week after the initial Fast and Furious press conference in January
   2011, Dodson dropped a small bombshell. He told a supervisor that he
   had been contacted by congressional staff. Dodson met that day with two
   ATF supervisors. According to their written contemporaneous accounts,
   Dodson was vague but claimed that Voth had always "treated him like
   shit" and that it "felt good" to speak with someone outside ATF.

   Dodson appeared on the CBS Evening News a week later. As Voth watched
   the program from his living room, he says, he wanted to vomit. He saw
   sentences from his "schism" e-mail reproduced on the TV screen. But CBS
   didn't quote the portions of Voth's e-mail that described how the group
   was divided by "petty arguing" and "adolescent behavior." Instead, CBS
   claimed the schism had been caused by opposition to gun walking (such
   alleged opposition is not discussed anywhere in the e-mail, which is
   below). CBS asserted that Dodson and others had protested the tactic
   "over and over," and then quoted portions of Voth's e-mail in a way
   that left the impression that gun walking was endorsed at headquarters.
   CBS contacted the ATF (but not Voth directly). The result was a report
   that incorrectly painted Voth as zealously promoting gun walking. (A
   CBS spokeswoman, Sonya McNair, says CBS does not publicly discuss its
   editorial process but notes, "The White House has already acknowledged
   the truth of our report.")

   The "Witch Hunt"

   Less than 36 hours after the CBS report, Voth was jolted awake at dawn
   by the blaring of his burglar alarm. With his wife and children still
   in bed, he crept down the stairs of his desert home, his ATF-issued .40
   caliber Sig Sauer extended before him. In the garage, he saw a door
   ajar and a massive kettle bell he used for workouts knocked from its
   place. Outside, the fleeing intruder had left behind a partial
   footprint in the sand.

   As Voth waited for the police, he checked his e-mail and found an
   anonymous threat, sent minutes earlier: "You God-damned stupid
   'Yes-Man' who does not have either the morals, or the intelligence, to
   realize that allowing this 'Fast and Furious' operation would result in
   unnecessary, unjustified deaths: MAY YOU EAT SHIT AND DIE." Later his
   wife found a strange car outside their house and an angry post on the
   Internet listing their home address. Voth confidentially shared his
   concern about that post in a meeting with two senior ATF officials,
   only to find an account of the meeting on the Sipsey Street blog within
   24 hours.

   The ATF's office of operations security investigated the threats to
   Voth. A confidential report on March 29, 2011, concluded, "ATF
   'insiders' are the number one threat to GS Voth and his family." The
   report cited "at least six individuals," whom it did not name, who had
   "personal agendas to undermine the credibility of ATF supervisors and
   members of management as retribution for [Voth's] operational
   shortcomings." The report cited the two blogs and concluded that "the
   malicious intent of insiders" had led directly to Voth's becoming the
   target of a "nation-wide...libel campaign."

   Politicians soon got involved, and the situation grew worse for the
   ATF. In June, Republican staffers for the House Oversight and
   Government Reform Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee released
   a joint report that leaned heavily on interviews with Dodson, Casa, and
   Alt and identified Voth as a central figure in the scandal. It quoted
   Dodson describing Voth as "giddy" over the slaughter in Mexico--Voth
   says he was deeply upset by the violence--but didn't reflect Voth's
   perspective. The report was released two weeks before Voth was
   scheduled to be questioned for the first time by congressional
   investigators. (A spokesman for Issa says the committee attempted to
   interview Voth earlier.)

   As the allegations mounted, pressure intensified. In early July the
   ATF's once supportive acting director, Melson--who according to e-mails
   had been briefed weekly on the case--went to Congress and threw his own
   people under the bus. Melson told Grassley that he had read the case
   reports only after the scandal broke, and had been "sick to his
   stomach," according to press accounts of the meeting. In August, Melson
   resigned, as did Arizona's U.S. Attorney, Burke. (Melson's lawyer,
   Richard Cullen, says the Justice Department's inspector general will
   likely answer many of the continuing questions.) In December 2011, the
   Justice Department retracted its Feb. 4 letter, in which it had denied
   walking guns in the Fast and Furious case.

   For Voth, steeped in military loyalty, Melson's betrayal was the blow
   he couldn't fathom. Voth began losing weight, losing sleep. As he puts
   it, "You barely remember your own name, your mind is going 100 miles an
   hour." He no longer knew what to do or who could be trusted. "There
   would be no way," he says, "to foreshadow this."

   Since the scandal erupted, almost everyone associated with Fast and
   Furious has been reassigned. Dodson, Casa, and Alt have been
   transferred to other field offices. Voth, who has now been interviewed
   by congressional investigators and the Justice Department's inspector
   general, has been reassigned to a desk job in Washington.

   New facts are still coming to light--and will likely continue to do so
   with the Justice Department inspector general's report expected in
   coming months. Among the discoveries: Fast and Furious' top
   suspects--Sinaloa Cartel operatives and Mexican nationals who were
   providing the money, ordering the guns, and directing the recruitment
   of the straw purchasers--turned out to be FBI informants who were
   receiving money from the bureau. That came as news to the ATF agents in
   Group VII.

   Today, with Attorney General Holder now squarely in the cross hairs of
   Congress, Democrats and Republicans are accusing each other of
   political machinations. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat and
   ranking member of the oversight committee, has accused Issa of
   targeting Holder as part of an "election-year witch hunt." Issa has
   alleged on Fox News that Fast and Furious is part of a liberal
   conspiracy to restrict gun rights: "Very clearly, [the ATF] made a
   crisis and they are using this crisis to somehow take away or limit
   people's Second Amendment rights." (Issa has a personal history on this
   issue: In 1972, at age 19, he was arrested for having a concealed,
   loaded .25-caliber automatic in his car; he ultimately pleaded guilty
   to possession of an unregistered gun.)

   Issa's claim that the ATF is using the Fast and Furious scandal to
   limit gun rights seems, to put it charitably, far-fetched. Meanwhile,
   Issa and other lawmakers say they want ATF to stanch the deadly tide of
   guns, widely implicated in the killing of 47,000 Mexicans in the
   drug-war violence of the past five years. But the public bludgeoning of
   the ATF has had the opposite effect. From 2010, when Congress began
   investigating, to 2011, gun seizures by Group VII and the ATF's three
   other groups in Phoenix dropped by more than 90%.

   firearms trafficking within the U.S. The story has been clarified.
