[24]Senate begins wading through hundreds of immigration reform amendments

   US Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) questions New York Federal Reserve
   Bank President Timothy Geithner, US President Barack Obama's nominee
   for Treasury Secretary, during his confirmation hearing before the
   Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill in Washi
   Immigration reform is finally beginning its move through the Senate,
   with the Senate Judiciary Committee starting to tackle hundreds of
   proposed amendments. Proposing a ridiculous number of amendments is
   just one of several Republican strategies attempting to prevent or gut
   any meaningful reform.

   Iowa's Chuck Grassley and Kentucky's Rand Paul are [30]comparing
   immigration reform to Obamacare, which should give you an idea of what
   fate they want it to meet; Grassley has also proposed 77 amendments.
   Utah Sen. Mike Lee, for his part, is urging [31]incremental reform. As
   in, how about if we just do border control now and put off talking
   about a path to citizenship.

   Grassley is neck and neck with Alabama's Jeff Sessions in the race to
   offer [32]the most terrible amendments. Grassley wants to restrict
   visas for refugees and prohibit humanitarian travel, while Sessions
   wants to require in-person interviews for every immigrant seeking
   provisional legal status and refuse legal status to low-income
   undocumented immigrants. Canadian-Texan Ted Cruz just wants to go ahead
   and ban anyone who's ever been an undocumented immigrant from ever
   becoming a citizen.

   And all the while Republicans are offering all these amendments--the
   ones seeking to stigmatize and punish immigrants and block citizenship
   and the ones just seeking to slow down the passage of any reform bill
   at all--they're screaming that Democrats are the ones proposing a
   poison pill. That's because Vermont's Patrick Leahy has offered an
   amendment that would [33]let American citizens sponsor their long-term
   same-sex partners for green cards. As if Republicans would suddenly be
   on board with a path to citizenship if Leahy withdrew that amendment.
   No, it's just another excuse and delaying tactic.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       the simple nuts and bolts of government or specific to his
       constituents.  Its always just RW agenda advancement and a complete

       He put an amendment on this to require in-person interviews of
       every current illegal alien that is seeking provisional residency.
       The estimate on this is over 11 million people.  So Immigration
       officers are going to have to conduct and document 11 million
       in-person interviews around the country.

       Should we also then stop the mandatory interview for those who
       apply for a U.S. visa?
       In other words, why should we bother to continue to require an
       interview process for those trying to comet to the U.S. from
       outside the country if we aren't even going to try to really
       ascertain the true identity of those we are going to grant
       residency to that are already inside the country?
       Seems like a giant waste of time.

 There are a lot of 70 year old ([102]0+ / 0-)
       mothers who want to visit their US citizen children. They
       previously had visas that have since expired and all they need to
       do is to get their visas renewed. They often have their interviews
       waived because they would have to travel overnight by ferry to get
       to where the consulate is located.
       Many business people who have visa that have expired and have
       impeccable immigration histories often have their visa interviews
       waived too.
       Many scholars and experts of international renown are invited by US
       institutions to come to the US to make presentations. They are well
       known to our state department staffers abroad. The too may have
       their interview waived, especially if they have a previous
       immigration history.
       There's more to visa interview waivers than your comment
       acknowledges.
       All visa interview waiver policy is trying to do is to allocate use
       of preciously few resources more wisely.

 It's the two track system ([106]0+ / 0-)
       We are going to have one track for legal immigrants, and a second
       track for illegal immigrants. Legal immigrants will have to go
       through all the interviews, pay all the fees, wait the years, and
       then they will get the card.
       Illegal immigrants won't have to.

 I've got an Amendment. ([110]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [111]radarlady, [112]jbob

   We need to mandate a minimum wage for all immigrant H1-B Visa workers.

   The minimum wage should be $200,000/yr.

   Why? Because if a Corporation is sponsoring an H1-B worker, they are
   claiming that this guy is Smarter, Harder-Working, and Cooler than any
   of us regular Americans.

   Such a person is truly exceptional, and deserves a high salary!

   Besides, let's see if Corporations really need these guys or if they
   are just trying to drive down wages. Let them put their money where
   their mouths are.

   Whaddya say? Who is in favor of a Minimum Wage for Immigrants?

   This isn't snark. I'm serious. I'm as serious as cancer (cancer that
   you can't afford healthcare for because you lost your healthcare when
   they brought in immigrant workers to take your job).

       but get your point. I used to work in a building owned by Cable &
       Wireless in Northern Virginia. A British firm. Their Bluetooth
       division before anybody knew what that was (late 90s). The managers
       were American but all the "workers," well H1-B Visa folks.
       I never understood how this happened, cause even at that time I
       knew a lot of Americans that couldn't find a job.

       I have dozens of $100K technical jobs open right this second in
       Reston, VA.  I posted on this the other day in the Kos Work Bank
       diary.
       I can't find people to fill them.  I got ZERO responses here.
       Not sure if we'll resort to H1-B's or not, but this idea that there
       is just a surplus of workers with every qualification known to man
       is divested from reality.
       We have been recruiting for MONTHS and haven't filled half the
       spots... we're even paying people to move here from other states.

       In NOVA I totally understand. I worked at ad agencies, but

       open. It was just a fact of life. When I mention that here folks

       I am not in the Fed gov or government contracting but yeah.. that

       Also, if anyone is, or knows someone that is, a college grad
       looking to get into sales, we are paying up to $1500 relocation
       costs to move here and do software sales.
       We can't find those jobs either.
       (Note - this is a major global company that everyone on this site
       has heard of, if not an active customer of ours.)
       Sales is not my department, but we have 30+ jobs open at entry
       level and a handful for senior sales mangers as well.  Entry
       requires no experience, senior requires experience specifically in
       selling software.

 No... not in this position ([143]0+ / 0-)
       This is specialized unit within a larger company.  We have entry
       level positions elsewhere but I am not involved with that and they
       are not located in Virginia.
       We do training to get people from mid-level to senior level, we
       train on our specific applications and we offer training to fill
       gaps in between specializations of senior people.
       Like I said, these are not entry level roles and we have a lot of
       people that came in fully capable of performing the job on Day 1.
       Of course we train on the specialty of the role but we do not have
       the headcount bandwidth to teach networking fundamentals to someone
       freshly minted college grad or certification course completer.  We
       only hire experienced engineers.
       ...unless you meant Sales.  Which in that case OF COURSE we do
       training.  Its a 90 to 120 day training curriculum to train people
       that have ZERO experience.  Now.. admittedly, I have no idea how
       that works.  I am not, nor have I ever been, a sales guy and I hope
       that I NEVER EVER am.
       But I do know that I  have an entire floor of my building with
       almost 200 people (the vast majority of which are fresh graduates
       or other 20-30 somethings) making some serious cash.... weekly and
       monthly bonuses, monthly trips to Jamaica for the top sales team,
       commission incentives, training, seminar trips, and all kinds of
       other stuff.   ...and in Q4 of this year we're taking over another
       half-floor within the building to expand more Sales teams for new
       products.

 Really? You have $100k Jobs? ([166]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [167]WorkerInUSA, [168]IT Professional

   Well, if you cannot find workers for your $100K jobs, then The Free
   Market is trying to tell you something.

   You must raise your wages and make them $120K jobs.  This means that:

   - Your shareholders must accept smaller dividends
   - Your CEO must accept a lower bonus, and
   - Your customers must pay higher prices.

   That is the way The Free Market works. But the 1% (and the corporations
   they own) are trying to use H1-B visa immigrants to cheat the market.
   Especially when the market starts to favor labor over capital.

       They might not be unemployed. They might be underemployed at

       Or, they might be taking a break, living off savings and spending
       time with their family.
       Whatever. That's none of your business. Your business is the fact
       that, if you want them to work for you, you must pay more than
       $100k.
       Corporations must enter into a bidding war for labor. For once.
       Corporations must not get to dictate immigration policy and they
       must not become the (unelected) decision-makers over who enters the
       US.
       (Also if you raise wages, US college graduates will change their
       majors and get the training to fill your jobs. Why should any
       college student go $100,000 into debt to study a technical field?

       I've worked in DC/NoVA for decades and its always been like this;

        I used to work for a San Fran based law firm and it was even

 The link has the summary ([207]0+ / 0-)
       Im not posting the actual link as I have no interest in linking my
       actual company name to my DKos ID.
       If anyone is interested, they can contact me or send a resume.  I
       am not in Human Resources, so if you send me a qualified resume you
       will be contacted by someone from the Talent Acquisition department
       to do an online application and schedule a phone interview.  Also,
       not being in HR, I don't know all the details about things like
       benefits.  I don't have kids and my wife is an HR exec, so I don't
       read the details and just sign up for what she tells me to.  But I
       can tell you we have everything: Health, Flex spending, commuter
       benefits, 401-k, paid vacation, the works....
       Here are the tech requirements.  This is not entry level.  We need
       a sizable amount of experience... we're flexible, but make no
       mistake:  You need to know your shit.  IT people know what I mean.
        The salary ranges from the high $50's to the low $120's depending
       on experience.  There is also the potential for a relocation bonus
       for very qualified candidates.
       o    Exchange Back-end Management (2003, 2007, 2010)
       o    SQL DB Backup and Restore
       o    Disaster Recovery/ Business Continuity
       o    Backup software such as Backup Exec or Acronis
       o    Windows Server OS support
       o    Virtualization
       o    Hyper-V, VMWare
       o    Networking Essentials
       o    Switching and Routing
       o    Storage (SAN, NAS, DAS)
       o    Microsoft Certification: MCTS, MCITP (Enterprise Messaging
       Admin) always a plus.
       Fair warning:  You also have to be able to pass a background check
       and drug test. (Not my rules, but that's the policy for every
       position in the country at any level)
       And finally:  This is NOT remote work.  We will not consider
       someone telecommuting or working from home.  You need to be IN THE
       OFFICE in Northern Virginia every day.

       Just rounding out the whole job description to distinguish it from

       Look at that list.. that is general hands-on network engineering.
       ..of course if someone is so perfectly tailored to the job that
       they have EVERY one of them, then they should definitely email

 If they have hands on skills, they are qualified ([223]0+ / 0-)
       and we'd want to interview them.
       3-5 I'd say on average... maybe 4-6.... more if they are looking
       specifically for the higher end of that salary range or are seeking
       a management position.
       The key is the skills.  If they are coming from a large company or
       data-center environment where their specialized job function was
       building and managing large vSphere environments on parallel SANs
       running a distributed AppAssure recovery system or something.. then
       we'd be open to less "years" and just snatch then up for their
       hands-on knowledge.
       If they worked at a small company where they were responsible for
       an entire network, they know Exchange well, they ran a P-to-V
       process on a half dozen or so servers and used BackUp Exec to
       backup to an on-site NAS.... well, then we're going to ask a lot of
       questions about how much hardcore work they've done on these
       technologies and what other things they know.
       If they are a hard-core specialized firewall/router engineer.. they
       may be God-Damned BRILLIANT... and we would have no interest in
       speaking with them.

       They check for re-location viability, salary expectations, and
       handle all the admin details of application completion and

       Managers sift through the resumes to screen... Four of the most
       senior engineers in the department do the phone interview (which is
       a basic level tech-screen) and candidates are brought on-site for
       indepth tech interview and a final interview with the director
       (both on the same visit).
       HR has to track everything because they log every applicant and
       whatnot for referrals, EEOC reporting, any relationships with
       existing employees, etc.
       They also manage the background report, drug test and reference
       check process. (but those are only done after the acceptance of a
       tentative offer)

       Republicans don't control the Senate.  The only way they can get a
       bill to the floor or in front of a committee is if we let them.
       Unless you mean the House, in which case none of this even applies.
        The Speaker runs everything in the House.
       Showdowns are great theater.  But you can't hope for showdowns and
       then bitch about partisan gridlock.
       Committees are supported to be where laws and amendments get hashed
       out and negotiated.  Its not like these things are behind closed
       doors (unless National Security is being discussed).  I watch
       plenty of Judiciary Comm hearings all the time.
        But the idea is that once a bill comes out of committee it already
       has a base-level of bipartisan support and then can be brought for
       a final "showdown" vote.

   pandering platfrom.
