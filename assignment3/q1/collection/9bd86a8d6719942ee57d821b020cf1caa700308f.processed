   Hello Reddit! I am the host of MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" and
   author of the book Drift. I have just over an hour to answer questions
   (wish I could stay longer!) and will do my best to answer as many
   questions as possible.

   Edit: Proof: [132]https://twitter.com/maddow/status/310056125951258624

   Edit: If you're wondering who I am, I tweet here:

   Drift tour: [136]http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/drift

   Edit: Thanks for such awesome questions! This has been a blast. I hope
   you'll have me back some time. Now I have to go have nightmares about
   the giant duck.

   Yeah, this AMA is quite disappointing. I had to scroll down half the
   page before I saw any of her responses and none of the top rated
   questions got answers. I like Rachel but this is a big bummer.

   And what do you make of [259]the comments of ex MSNBC host Cenk Uygur
   that he was forced out because his views were too hostile to the
   Democrats? Despite the fact he was getting good ratings. (Edit:

   He wasn't let go because he was hostile to Democrats. He was kicked out
   by Washington because he ran the story about Roger Ailes blueprint for
   Fox News from the Nixon era presidential memos.

   If you watch the video he made about his exit, he explains that an
   msnbc head called him into his office and said 'look Cenk, it's cool to
   be an outsider but we're insiders so we have to act like insiders.
   Washington wants you to tone it down so how about we offer you a
   smaller contributing role instead of your current slot (even though
   it's currently excelling in the ratings department) and we'll even pay
   you more'.

   He turned down their offer.

   Rachel,

   What do you think is the single worst offense being committed by the
   Obama administration right now? What about the Republicans in the
   Senate and/or House?

   ETA: Several people have pointed out that this might not be a fair
   wording. Let's rephrase: Since we can safely assume that you have your
   disagreements with the president's handling of certain issues, what is
   your strongest point of disagreement with the Obama administration,
   whether in terms of their agenda, their actions, or even their silence
   on certain issues? And same question, for the Republicans in the House
   and Senate.

   It's never going to happen. If you have ever seen her on Bill Maher, a
   liberal show, she can't handle any negatives about the Obama
   administration nor can she have a constructive conversation. If fact,
   one Bill Maher show she claimed that the other panelists were attacking
   her when all they were doing was pushing her for answer she didn't want
   to give. She is in the back pocket of the Obama administration, just
   like MSNBC/NBC.

   I remember that. She went on a 30 second rant about how rude it was for
   the other panelists to interrupt her, while she interrupted nearly
   everything the other two guys tried to say.

   She also claimed that she wasn't a Democrat and doesn't take the side
   of a Democrat over a Republican.

   The entire time, despite having two other very well informed panelists
   there, she acted like her opinions were proof enough. She refused to
   even talk about the Fast & Furious program because she said it was just
   Republican propaganda and it was Bush's fault anyways. One of the guys
   mentioned that the program under Bush was far different than this and
   she "proved" him wrong by saying "No, end of story."

   When she isn't in control of the debate like she is on her own show,
   she struggles. She wasn't informed about a few issues that were brought
   up by the others and her ignorance showed.

   Don't take this as a just a Maddow hater talking. I'm actually reading
   her new book now and I love it. I just think that she has a personality
   where she refuses to admit she is wrong or unaware of something. When
   she is, she gets incredibly defensive and refuses to allow an actual
   conversation to occur.

   I don't know why this is surprising. She is basically the left-wing end
   of the partisan media. Maybe not as nutball as say, Hannity, but still
   terribly biased.

   Its sad when the only political commentator who can at least attempt to
   show both sides and admit when the president he voted for is wrong, or
   the 'other side' gets something right seems to be Jon Stewart, a
   comedian.

   Rand Paul's anti-drone filibuster lasted 13 hours, but no Democrat
   besides Ron Wyden showed floor support. Individuals at your network
   have even been openly hostile to Paul.

   John Brennan has been on the wrong side of numerous controversial
   post-9/11 issues. Four years ago, his advocacy of torture forced him to
   withdraw for top CIA spot. Yesterday all but two Democrats voted to
   confirm him.

   So after ceding authority on drones to Repulicans, Democrats gave near
   unanimous approval to a scoundrel.
     * Hasn't this been a pathetic showing for "progressive" Democrats?
     * Are power and party so much more important than (alleged)
       principles?
     * Was Democrats' anti-war talk of the 00's just opportunistic
       sloganeering for electoral success? If not, what happened to them?

   EDIT: Wow, many thanks for all the thoughtful responses, even if my
   question was not selected by Rachel. And many more thanks to the
   generous person who Goldened my account!

   Bottom line I'd like to see more Democratic pressure on the
   administration - from the media, the public, and especially Congress -
   regarding warrantless wiretapping of phones and email, indefinite
   detention, Guantanamo, extrajudicial executions, undeclared wars, etc.
   Maybe that's totally unrealistic. But it's been very discouraging to
   witness the diminished appetite to oppose the expansion and
   institutionalization of Bush-era terror policies overseen by a
   president elected on his principled anti-war, constitutional law
   credentials.

   If we finally return to these issues because an unpopular opposition
   party sees crossover appeal with the issue of drones, I'm all for it.
   Maybe this will all be forgotten again but I hope that's not the case.

   And if you're still reading this (or if you're just scrolling down the
   page), I recommend this relevant film clip:

   I would like to say thank you for taking the time to do an AMA. One of
   my concerns today is that I feel the American public is fed up with
   both the Congress and the media. That the bickering only divides us
   more as a nation at a time when we need to be looking for ways to come
   together.

   [817]Your piece on Rand Paul's 13 hour speech condensed into 60 seconds
   of Hitler reference was an example of the problem. The lack of
   understanding [818]Godwin's law and the use of [819]argumentum ad
   logicam in the matter was disingenuous at best.
     * Do you think the media will ever stop the partisan bickering?
     * Do you think Congress will get anything meaningful done?
     * What would you recommend to help solve some of these issues?

   I respect who you are and what you do so please don't take any offense
   to my critiques. Reddit please don't just down vote if you disagree,
   voice your opinions in the comments.

   EDIT: It's a shame it's getting down voted into the ground but [820]she
   did partially respond

   This is an important question. I really want to hear her thoughts on
   this because, as somebody with both progressive and libertarian
   streaks, I was moved by Rand Paul's speech. I had maybe watched 2:00 of
   clips involving him before, and found myself watching his filibuster
   for hours and hours, right up until it was done.

   Later, when I checked to see how it was covered in the news, I was
   dismayed by how many outlets trivialized the importance of his defense
   of our Constitution.

   Hi Rachel! I really enjoy your show and Chris Hayes' show but I feel
   that a lot of programming on MSNBC is of the mold of Fox News style
   partisan hackery. Do you think that style of programming, irrespective

   I trained and served with Eddie Ray Routh, the U.S.M.C. veteran accused
   of killing Chris Kyle and another. We deployed to Iraq together. Can
   you please cover the story, because it connects, war, P.T.S.D.. gun
   control, veterans, and the way veterans fall though the cracks after
   coming home wounded? I thought you could follow it with a deeper

   Hi -- thank you for asking this, and thanks for volunteering those
   details about your closeness to the story. We have not yet covered
   those killings, mostly because I've been following the story as a crime
   and a tragedy, but not one that I felt like we could add much to,
   beyond what's already out there. Your question has me reconsidering
   that. I'm not sure if we will do something on it, but I will think it
   over again and start talking with producers and sources about whether
   we might be able to do something that moved the story forward. Thanks
   for serving -- I'm glad you're home.

   Additionally, it offers a way to prevent new shootings by enhancing the
   medical and mental care we give to our veterans, which is much more
   politically tenable than gun control or nationwide mental health reform
   right now, while acting as a potential stepping stone to the latter as
   well.

   It's not a war. It's a jobs program.

   Edit: I didn't realize that two snarky four word sentences would garner
   so much commentary.

   Think about what would have happened if Bush wound down the Iraq war in
   say 2008. On top of the unemployment from the recession we would have
   thousands of ex-military looking for jobs. We would also have defense
   contractors laying off in droves. The recession would have become a
   full blown depression.

   This didn't happen because more than a few Republicans realized that
   they could have an economic stimulus without them actually voting for
   an economic stimulus. The wars provided the cover for the necessary
   ongoing deficit spending.

   Hey Rachael, I'm a longtime fan of the show. I have to ask, though, a
   few weeks ago you ran a segment emphasizing that Obama has reduced
   spending, and you backed it up by showing [1083]this chart and
   disussing the importance of that specific chart for an entire segment.
   I'm curious as to why you included state and local spending in that
   chart, considering that Obama has no influence over state and local
   budgets. My intuition would lead me to believe that a good deal of that
   spending reduction was due to both the Tea Party takeover of local
   governments, and the recession. Is there a reason why you didn't just
   show federal spending?

   That's a local affiliate of NBC, not NBC itself putting it forward for
   national coverage. It's a shame that the discussion of police

   I really like the way Shep Smith (at Fox News Channel) balances
   anchorman gravitas... with a willingness to put the artifice aside and
   acknowledge what it really going on. Some of us can pull off seeming
   like human beings on TV, some of us can pull off V.O.G. authority, but
   Shep is really very good at both. Better than anyone else, I think.
   Also, I've met him and he's a nice person!

   Agreed. He actually handled that about as well as possible. He didn't

   I think most of Reddit has no idea what AMA has become for public
   figures: it's a chance to look good not to Reddit, but to the world.

   In media-speak, they're hip and edgy for posting here.

   If you want to do a successful AMA, you probably do it the same way
   that you do a press conference: by seeding the audience with friendly
   voices to ask easy questions about the issues you want to talk about.

   It's not much different than [1372]using fake Twitter accounts to bump
   your following.

   From that point of view, it should not be surprising that you don't
   have many answers here, especially to the difficult questions.

   Our family hung the Rolling Stone photo of you, shooting a Henry Big
   Boy rifle, on the front of our refrigerator. (We love you and we love
   repeater rifles.) Do you think the gun legislation and conversion
   currently brewing in the US would be more efficient if more liberals,
   who occasionally like to get their cowgirl on, came out of the closet?
   I really don't see why the topic ends up being so right wing vs left
   wing. I feel like there should be much more overlap between the camps.

   Two things: (1) I agree! I think this issue is way more polarized in
   politics than it is in real life. Gun appreciation, even gun enthusiasm
   (which I confess to in a small way!) is absolutely not inconsistent
   with a belief in rational gun-safety reform. It's weird that we think
   of the political battle as gun-lovers versus gun-haters -- do you know
   a single gun-lover (who doesn't work in the political side of the gun
   movement) who thinks it makes sense for someone adjudicated mentally
   ill to be barred from buying a gun from a guy at a store, but allowed
   to buy a guy under a tent or at a convention center? Also, (2) would
   you please do me the favor of drawing a tiny little moustache on that
   picture on your fridge?

   I'm actually a little glad some people in this thread are let down.
   Maybe now we can grow up a little and realize that because someone
   holds some of the same political views as you, doesn't make them open
   minded or honest.

   She's dodged the most important questions, and left in the blink of an
   eye.

   Edit Let me just add quick the mentality she had coming into this
   thing...she, like many other journalists and politicians alike expected
   it to be an advertisement, not an honest debate. This is what discourse
   in America has become...where even a supposed journalist, is surprised
   at being asked tough questions.

   Quite frankly, if Obama and the left wing media is the best progressive
   ideals has to offer, if this is all we have to counter the
   conservatives, the country will slip further, and fuhrer to the right.

   Fucking sad, really.

   My parents were very very horrified by the appearance of Dead Kennedys
   records in the house. I don't remember a particular song that made them
   crazy -- I think the band name itself did all the work there. I was
   obsessive about Husker Du. I also liked Meat Puppets and Black Flag,
   but really I would have done anything for Bob Mould. I actually got
   grounded when my mom found an SST records sampler LP in my room -- I
   think it had particularly porny cover art and she was very rattled by
   it. As a teenager, I thought at the time that it was probably the apex
   of my coolness. As an adult, looking back, I realize that is true.

   As a veteran of Afghanistan, I just wanna say I loved your book Drift.
   It is very accurate and probably the most insightful writings on the
   military by any civilian commentator.

   Hi Rachel, I enjoy the show. I also appreciate you taking the time to
   do this. Could you possibly take us through the schedule and the steps
   for preparing for the show? Thanks again.

   Dang. I'm a little late to the party but I do have a question:

   Why do you create fake accounts all over the internet to make it seem
   as if you are more popular than you are?

   You've been exposed on several sites lately creating fake accounts,
   including Twitter and now Reddit.

   Are your opinions that unpopular, or are you just a hack?

   You say you get hate mail for doing segments on drones. Can you
   elaborate on why people dislike these segments?

   Do most of your viewers prefer to see a Republican blooper reel instead
   of criticism of Obama?

   Dear Rachel,

   The conventional treatment options for my back and knee conditions are
   invasive, risky, and typically lead to more surgeries and drug
   dependence. The use of my own stem cells is my only hope. The FDA is
   going beyond its jurisdiction in shutting down docs' clinics where
   patients are treated with their own stem cells. The FDA wants to force
   us to use embryonic stem cells or other donor cells, which are far
   riskier and usually result in life-long dependency on anti-rejection
   drugs... because the profit is not in the cure; it's in the drug
   dependency. The FDA has long been in bed with the Big Pharma execs.

   I have 485 signatures now! More doctors have signed!!! I've also got
   the endorsement of a former congressman whose son is an oncologist who
   endorses AASC (using one's own stem cells) Therapies. Would you please
   sign and support my petition, so I can get my life back from chronic,
   debilitating pain!!! These therapies may help you or someone whom you
   love!

   [1788]http://signon.org/sign/using-our-own-stem-cells?source=c.fwd&r_by
   =425772

   I think this would also make an excellent topic of discussion on your
   show. I am a member of a member of a stem cell advocacy group and can
   provide you with plenty of research, etc. on this topic.

   Sincerely,

   Claire Hooper

   Rachel. I see Chris, Edd, you and Lawrence programs and you all do the
   same. You all just inform us about bad things but no solutions. We need
   political activist like when Edd went against Walker in Wisconsin or
   Martin Luther king for equality and also Moore with the movement
   against Wall Street. We need a political activist to mobilized the
   people and go to Washington and demand the firing of all House
   Representatives that are not doing anything. President should stop
   paying their salaries. Bilgone.

   I wish everyone here that is disappointed in her lack of answering any
   real questions would just turn her off. You want the media to change,
   refuse to give them ratings. I completely stopped watching any sort of
   network news and I'm both more informed about what is currently going
   on in the world and less frustrated by the obvious bullshit fed to us
   as news.
