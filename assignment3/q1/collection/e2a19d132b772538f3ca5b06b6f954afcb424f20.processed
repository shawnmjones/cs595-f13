       Greeley, which is the only real city in NoCo outside of Larimer
       (which is not in this silly proposal) has the University of
       Northern Colorado. 90% of the current students would suddenly be
       out of state residents paying higher tuition. Boom goes the largest
       employer in Weld. Being this far against common sense oil and gas
       regulations designed for safety for public health is silly.
       Fracking is exempt from clean water and air acts. Colorado's
       regulations aren't even the strictest in the states, and the US
       compared to other 1st world nations is loosely regulated in this
       sector. This idea came from a right wing organization supporting
       big oil and gas. Look into the evils of Colorado Counties Inc.
       Thanks for the laughs.Conway, jokes on you.

       If North Colorado becomes a state, it, the numbers, will still be
       neutral 'cause Texas is about ready to secede!

       Where did you get the photos of the homes from? That is in no way
       northEASTERN Colorado landscapes. In fact I think you have a photo
       of Boulder in the mix. NorthEASTERN colorado is a desolate
       wasteland. They might want to think about not using the name
       NorthEASTERN Colorado and instead use "the land of hopeless despair
       or land with no gas stations or rest stops". If they wanna succeed
       and pollute themselves into oblivion why not. I think that
       progressives of Colorado would agree that we will not miss that
       swath of the state.

            The name is not North Eastern Colorado but North Colorado. We
            are only despaired because we are not fully represented do to
            the likes of you. Just remember those on the plains of
            Colorado do in fact feed and support a vast majority within
            the state and YOU will miss what we do put into the Colorado
            coffers..

       I believe North and South New Jersey have tried this before to no
       avail.
       I know you're think such a small state that New Jersey but it is
       vastly different from North to South.

       PR voted (or didn't vote, depending upon whom you ask) to join the
       union last November. DC is perpetually begging to join the union.
       There has long been talk of WA, OR, and CA all splitting into
       various states. The only thing different about N Colorado is that
       there's oil in them thar hills that are trying to seceed and form
       their own state- oil that stuffs the coffers in Denver.

       New Yorkers have long considered splitting in two. Westchester and
       Rockland Counties, plus NYC and Long Island would be its own state.
       Everything north of Westchester and Rockland would be a different
       state. Or else Long Island would be its own state and would be part
       of New England. But 100 senators is too even a number for this to
       be considered.
