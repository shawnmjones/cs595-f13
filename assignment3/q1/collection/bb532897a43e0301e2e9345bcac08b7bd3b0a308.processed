[23]Senate committee approves ENDA with bipartisan vote

   Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) talks to reporters during a series of votes
   in Washington December 17, 2011. The U.S. Senate voted on Saturday to
   extend a payroll tax cut for two months in legislation that also
   attempts to force President Barack Obama to appro
   Orrin Hatch voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. No,
   really.
   A Senate committee [30]approved the Employment Non-Discrimination Act
   Wednesday morning. And get this: The vote was bipartisan, with
   Republicans Orrin Hatch of Utah, Mark Kirk of Illinois, and Lisa
   Murkowski of Alaska joining Democrats in support for a 15 to seven
   margin.

   With the bill having had [31]53 cosponsors before Hatch and Murkowski
   decided to vote for it, it appears to now have 55 votes, within
   striking distance of filibuster-busting levels. And Hatch's support,
   which was [32]contingent on strong exemptions for religious employers,
   should help some other Republicans, [33]like Ohio's Rob Portman, to
   support the bill. You'd think.

   ENDA would prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual
   orientation and gender identity. [34]Currently, 21 states and the
   District of Columbia have such laws, with only 16 of those offering
   protection based on gender identity, meaning that workers can be and
   are fired or otherwise abused for these reasons. The United States has
   made huge strides in recent years on marriage equality. But people need
   equality in the workplace, too, and too many LGBT people don't have
   that yet. This vote is a good step. Getting the bill through the Senate
   will be a better one, even if the Republican House is likely to
   continue to stand in the way.

   The White House [35]issued a statement on the vote:

     The President welcomes the bipartisan approval of S. 815, The
     Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) of 2013, by the Senate
     Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee today. He thanks
     Committee Chairman Harkin, Senator Merkley, and Senator Kirk for
     their leadership on this important issue.  The President has long
     supported an inclusive ENDA, which would enshrine into law strong,
     lasting and comprehensive protections against employment
     discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender
     identity. We look forward to the full Senate's consideration of
     ENDA, and continue to urge the House to move forward on this bill
     that upholds America's core values of fairness and equality.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [56]Tagging tips - [57]Search For Tags - [58]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [59]Civil
   Rights, [60]Community, [61]Congress, [62]Culture, [63]Economy,
   [64]Education, [65]Elections, [66]Energy, [67]Environment, [68]Health
   Care, [69]International, [70]Labor, [71]Law, [72]Media, [73]Meta,
   [74]National Security, [75]Science, [76]Transportation, or [77]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([78]California, [79]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   We aren't going to have those rights any time soon, because if this
   passes the Senate, it will then be killed in the House under the
   "majority of the majority" rule that Boehner selectively enforces.

   Still, passing the Senate would be huge progress, and one step closer
   on the tedious path towards finally making ENDA the law of the land.

       We all have those impulses. The difference is that conservatives
       and bigots get to indulge them--successfully, I might add, until we
       stop them--and we let "our better angels" rule both our discourse
       and our behavior.

 So-called "right to work" laws are to kill unions ([347]0+ / 0-)
       not to allow employers to fire people for discriminatory reasons.
       See [348]this link.
       The concept that you are referring to is [349]At-Will Employment
       which gives an employer the right to fire an employee without
       giving a reason. It's used throughout the country. As long as an
       employer doesn't state a wrongful reason, or it can be proved by
       other evidence that the reason was unlawfully discriminatory, it's
       fine and dandy.
       Something like ENDA is important, because it gives statutory
       support to employees whose firing may have been for discriminatory
       (but unstated) reasons.

   You have 54 Democrats, of whom, Bill Nelson, Joe Manchin, and Mark
   Pryor aren't co-sponsors. Nelson will probably support it (he supports
   gay marriage), though Pryor and Manchin are bigger question marks.
   However, given the scope of the religious exemptions, you'd think
   they'd be on board.

   So assuming every Democrat is tight on this, then you need 6
   Republicans. Hatch, Kirk, Murkowski, and Collins have all supported the
   bill in some way thus far, so I'll count them. Like the original post
   said, Portman could support it, and I'm guessing Chiesa (Lautenberg's
   replacement) will use this vote as an opportunity to burnish his
   moderate chops. If he doesn't, the Senate can just bring it up again
   when Booker wins the Senate race and they'll have the votes.

   The math is there, everyone just needs to pull through on this one.
   Then it can go to the House of Representatives and die like immigration
   reform. :(

     All are members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor
     and Pensions, which will mark up ENDA on Wednesday morning. The bill
     would make workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual
     orientation or gender identity illegal.

   [398]Except for certain organiztions that prefer to discriminate

     "My tendency is to vote for the bill," Hatch told The Huffington
     Post on Tuesday. He said he wanted to make sure that exemptions for
     religious organizations in the bill remain strong.

   So these republicans are "tending" towards allowing a Bill to pass that
   make exemptions for the religious right..

     ex·emp·tion

     1.freedom from an obligation: permission or entitlement not to do
     something that others are obliged to do
     2.exempt person or thing: somebody who or something that is exempt,
     e.g. income that is not taxed

   ..to make an exception when it comes to the LGBT community

     ex·cep·tion

     1.somebody or something excluded: somebody or something that is not
     included in or does not fit into a general rule, pattern, or
     judgment
     2.exclusion: the act or condition of being excluded

   Discrimination is okay under the guise of "religious liberty/freedom".
   So violating the separation of church and state is okay if it involves
   - the gay ?- as Rachel Maddow teases the religious right on this
