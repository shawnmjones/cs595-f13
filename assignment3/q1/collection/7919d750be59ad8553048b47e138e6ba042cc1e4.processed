State news: North Korea proposes high-level talks with U.S.

   By K.J. Kwon and Greg Botelho, CNN
   updated 6:50 AM EDT, Mon June 17, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Washington says North Korea needs to back up its words
     * A North Korean government group makes its offer to the U.S. to
       "ease tensions"
     * The U.S. has spearheaded efforts targeting North Korea's nuclear
       program
     * The North abruptly called off talks days ago with South Korea

   Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea has proposed high-level talks
   with the United States to "ease tensions in the Korean Peninsula," its
   state news agency reported early Sunday.

   The topics that "can be sincerely discussed" include easing military
   tensions, changing a truce treaty to a peace treaty, and nuclear
   matters, according to a statement from the North's National Defense
   Commission, as reported by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. It
   left some details -- like where and when the talks might be held -- up
   to Washington, and insisted U.S. officials should not lay out any
   preconditions for talks.

   "(The United States should) not lose the opportunity that is laid out
   and should actively agree with our resolute step and good intention,"
   the commission said.

   A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said the United States
   has always been willing to talk.

   "We will judge North Korea by its actions and not its words, and look
   forward to seeing steps that show North Korea is ready to abide by its
   commitments and obligations," Caitlin Hayden said.

   High-level Korean talks called off
   China changing tone on North Korea?
   2012: Time to vacation in North Korea

   A senior administration official said Washington will discuss the
   reports with Japan and South Korea at an upcoming meeting.

   For years, North Korea has been at odds with many in the international
   community, including the United States, over its missile and nuclear
   programs.

   Whether Pyongyang's offer is accepted -- and if so, on what terms --
   and whether the talks will happen remain to be seen.

   Last Tuesday, North Korea called off what were supposed to be the first
   high-level talks between North and South Korean officials in years.
   That meeting was supposed to start the next day.

   [41]High-level talks between Koreas called off

   South Korea's Unification Ministry said the North dropped out after a
   dispute about who should be involved in the talks, after each side
   contended that the other wasn't sending a sufficiently high-level
   official.

   The talks were to focus on, among other things, reviving joint economic
   activities. Amid a spike in tensions, the North in April halted
   activity at the Kaesong Industrial Zone, a shared industrial complex
   and major symbol of cooperation between the two countries.

   [42]North Korea removes missiles from launch site, U.S. official says

   It was not immediately clear what might be on the agenda if U.S. and
   North Korean officials meet. Washington has been at the forefront of
   those demanding an end to Pyongyang's nuclear program, pushing for
   sanctions and rallying other nations to its side.

   Tensions in and around the Korean Peninsula surged in December -- one
   year after Kim Jong Un assumed power after his father's death -- when
   North Korea launched a long-range rocket, then conducted an underground
   nuclear test two months later.

   Adm. Samuel J. Locklear, the top U.S. commander in the Pacific, said in
   April that North Korea's missile and weapons programs posed "a clear
   and direct threat to U.S. national security and regional peace and
   stability."

   [43]Why North Korean intelligence is so hard to read

   That same month, North Korea set out demanding conditions for talks.
   They included calling for the withdrawal of U.N. sanctions against it
   and a permanent end to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises.

   The United States and South Korea "should immediately stop all their
   provocative acts against the DPRK and apologize for all of them," the
   North's National Defense Commission said in a statement carried by
   state-run media, using the shortened version of North Korea's official
   name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

   But those talks never came to be, with South Korean Foreign Ministry
   spokesman Cho Tai-young describing the North's demands as
   "preposterous."

   The United States has said that, in order for it to engage in talks,
   North Korea would have to show a serious commitment to moving away from
   its nuclear program.

   If new talks actually happen, it will be the second senior-level
   meeting between the U.S. and North Korea since Kim Jong Un took power.

   The first talks were in February 2012, when North Korea's first vice
   minister, Kim Kye Gwan, held talks in Beijing with Glyn Davies, the
   U.S. envoy for North Korea policy.

   At the time, North Korea agreed to stop nuclear activity at its main
   facility in Yongbyon and impose a moratorium on nuclear tests and
   long-range missile launches in exchange for 240,000 tons of food
   assistance.

   However, the agreement fell apart after the U.N. imposed sanctions in
   response to North Korea's failed long-range rocket launch in April
   2012.
