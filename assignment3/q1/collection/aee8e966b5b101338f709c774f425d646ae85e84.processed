   (CNN) -- San Diego Mayor Bob Filner will resign Friday if the San Diego
   City Council accepts a proposed mediation agreement, local TV stations
   reported Thursday.

   An official familiar with the negotiations told CNN's Lindy Hall: "It
   is still our understanding that his resignation is part of the deal
   that the San Diego City Council needs to sign off on during tomorrow's
   closed session."

   The source emphasized that "until that happens, I don't believe you
   will see an official resignation."
   Accuser: Filner grabbed me in this photo

   The development comes amid several allegations that paint the mayor as
   a perpetrator of sexual harassment.
