[22]Georgia congressman says Paul Ryan is just too damn liberal

   Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA) official portrait
   From a New York Times op-ed [29]written by Rep. Paul Broun, a
   Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Georgia:

     The latest budget proposal by Representative Paul D. Ryan, called
     "The Path to Prosperity," is anything but. It fails to seriously
     address runaway government spending, the most pressing problem
     facing our nation. I cannot vote for something that would trick the
     American people into thinking that Congress is fixing Washington's
     spending problem, when in actuality we'd just be allowing it to
     continue without end.

   Despite Broun's rejection of the Ryan budget, many of the proposals
   that he endorses in his op-ed are virtually identical to elements of
   the Ryan plan. He dwells on a proposal to eliminate the Departments of
   Education and Energy, but while he tosses out the rhetorical red meat
   ("Constitutionally speaking, the federal government should not have a
   role in K-12 public education anyway," Broun writes), he doesn't
   actually propose a huge change in terms of the budgetary bottom-line.
   According to Broun's own numbers, his proposal would reduce Ryan's
   spending by just one percent.

   Yes, a one percent cut is enough to say that Broun's plan makes a bad
   plan even worse, but the similarities between Broun's plan and Ryan's
   plan are much bigger than the differences. They both seek to turn
   Medicaid into a block grant program. They both want to end Obamacare.
   They both want to turn Medicare into a voucher system. And they both
   support a balanced budget amendment.

   So despite his rhetoric, Broun actually isn't all that far removed from
   Ryan on a substantive basis. That's not terribly surprising: Proposing
   a budget significantly to the right of Ryan's plan is pretty much
   mission impossible. But Broun isn't primarily interested in budgetary
   policy, here--he's running for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in
   Georgia. He knows full well that as far as GOP primary voters are
   concerned, the crazier you sound, the better. And as long as people
   think he's crazier than Paul Ryan, Paul Broun could care less whether
   he actually is.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [42]Tagging tips - [43]Search For Tags - [44]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   [Copying Wikipedia here]

   On November 10, 2008, one week after the 2008 presidential election,
   Broun drew national attention[45] when he criticized President-elect
   Barack Obama's call for a civilian national service corps, suggesting
   that Obama might use it to establish a Marxist dictatorship.[46]

   In an interview with the Associated Press, Broun said, "That's exactly
   what Hitler did in Nazi Germany and it's exactly what the Soviet Union
   did. When he's proposing to have a national security force that's
   answering to him, that is as strong as the U.S. military, he's showing
   me signs of being Marxist." Broun later clarified his statement by
   saying, "We can't be lulled into complacency. You have to remember that
   Adolf Hitler was elected in a democratic Germany. I'm not comparing him
   to Adolf Hitler. What I'm saying is there is the potential of going
   down that road."[46]

       Funny thing is Broun would probably be damned to define any of
       those!

       calling one a right winger AND reasonable.

   & the Economy were)

   And he drags out the tired healthcare talking point for actions after
