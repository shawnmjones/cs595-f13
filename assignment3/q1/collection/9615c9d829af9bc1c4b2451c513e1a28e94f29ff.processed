[23]This week in the War on Workers: Is Walmart trying to weaken its
workforce by hiring more temps?

   Walmart sign
   [30]Because Walmart's labor practices weren't bad enough already:

     A Reuters survey of 52 stores run by the largest U.S. private
     employer in the past month, including one in every U.S. state,
     showed that 27 were hiring only temps, 20 were hiring a combination
     of regular full, part-time and temp jobs, and five were not hiring
     at all. The survey was based on interviews with managers, sales
     staff and human resource department employees at the stores.

     The new hiring policy is to ensure "we are staffed appropriately,"
     when the stores are busiest and is not a cost-cutting move, said
     company spokesman David Tovar. Temporary workers, he said, are paid
     the same starting pay as other workers.

   And hey, since Walmart never gives rank-and-file workers any raises,
   that means the starting pay that temps and other workers get is the
   same as longtime workers get! (Would that "starting pay" be the minimum
   wage, by any chance?) Apparently we're supposed to be excited that
   Walmart's workforce is less than 10 percent temps--which sounds like a
   relatively small number until you learn that before 2013, it was about
   2 percent temps.

   Don't you love that Walmart is like "we're using more temp workers
   because Reasons, but perish the thought that we're doing it to screw
   workers"? Even if the wages can't really get any lower, having more
   temps means people who are even more worried about keeping their jobs
   and definitely aren't going to be trying to organize and improve
   working conditions. Total coincidence with the increase in workers
   fighting back against Walmart's lousy pay and conditions, I'm sure.

   A fair day's wage
     * Here's something to be following right up to July 5: [31]The
       People's Tour for America is radio hosts Rick Smith and Pat
       LaMarche, Rick's wife and three kids, and a radio producer and
       [32]ubiquitous labor tweeter in an RV, hitting a new city just
       about every day across the country to Netroots Nation, then back to
       Pittsburgh, talking to workers about labor history and what's going
       on today. LaMarche compares their trip to [33]David and Goliath,
       with conservative talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh obviously
       serving as Goliath here. This week, they visited [34]the legendary
       Highlander Center.
     * Josh Eidelson and Sarah Jaffe discuss [35]Hugh Jackman's appearance
       at Walmart's shareholder meeting, and Sarah has feelings. Also as
       usual in their Belabored podcast they discuss all sorts of news.
     * Gov. Rick Scott signed a preemption law saying [36]Florida cities
       and towns can't pass paid sick leave laws even if they want to.
     * An important step was made toward [37]breaking down the intern
       economy, with a federal district judge ruling that Fox Searchlight
       Pictures violated minimum wage laws by not paying interns on the
       movie Black Swan:

     Eric Glatt and Alexander Footman, production interns on "Black
     Swan," sued Fox Searchlight in September 2011. In the suit, Mr.
     Glatt and Mr. Footman said they did basic chores, usually undertaken
     by paid employees. Like their counterparts in other industries, the
     interns took lunch orders, answered phones, arranged other
     employees' travel plans, tracked purchase orders, took out the trash
     and assembled office furniture.

     "I'm absolutely thrilled," said Mr. Glatt, who has an M.B.A. from
     Case Western Reserve University. "I hope that this sends a very loud
     and clear message to employers and to students doing these
     internships, and to the colleges that are cooperating in creating
     this large pool of free labor -- for most for-profit employers, this
     is illegal. It shouldn't be up to the least powerful person in the
     arrangement to have to bring a lawsuit to stop this."

   Unpaid internships not only allow companies to avoid hiring paid
   workers, but provide a route into many desirable fields of work that's
   not available to young people who can't afford to work for free.

       in New York City. The group previously organized workers at the Hot

       workers fighting back against wage theft, retaliatory firing, and
       unsafe working conditions.

     * [43]Janitors at Target stores in the Twin Cities held a 48-hour
       strike this week, seeking wages equivalent to what the unionized
       janitors at corporate headquarters get.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [62]Civil
   Rights, [63]Community, [64]Congress, [65]Culture, [66]Economy,
   [67]Education, [68]Elections, [69]Energy, [70]Environment, [71]Health

   [77]National Security, [78]Science, [79]Transportation, or [80]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([81]California, [82]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       In the neighborhood which Walmart's HQ is situated in, it looks run

       at, even if I hate Walmart with a passion (which I do).
       But really, it's not as if Walmart is not already screwing workers
       to begin with.   What have they got to lose?  It's not the style of
       the building that is a determining factor for how a company screws
       over its workers or community.  It's who the people are.

   I find it interesting that the reason why Walmart instituted this temp
   hiring practice isn't mentioned. [223]Walmart sources are claiming this
   is to get around the 30 hr insurance requirement.  Many others are
   moving to do the same.

   My niece was informed last week that her job that usually provided 32
   hrs per week would no longer give her over 19 hrs.  She is a clerk at a
   local gas station that is part of a regional chain.  My mother just
   retired from a cleaning position at a local university.  The management
   asked her to stay on as a "call in" that worked just a few hours per
   week.  The manager said that no one was to get full time positions any
   longer and everyone would be under 30 hrs.  Again, the reason given was
   healthcare reform laws.  Many on the lower end of the economic scale
   will just be forced to cobble together a living from multiple, part
   time jobs with few or no benefits.

   The sequester is the new Republican immigration reform plan. Make
   things so bad here in the US that no one will want to live here.

       But this was brought to you by the team that also developed the
       sequester because it would be "so painful no one will vote for it."

 Isn't this what Democrats expected? ([249]0+ / 0-)

   I thought this was the path to getting single-payer universal
   healthcare, by letting the selfish corps do what they do best, which is
   to take advantage of rent-seeking opportunities to further an
   ultimately progressive agenda.

   If work hours are more flexible, that's also a bonus. The only problem
   I see is the low, flat wages, but did/do any of us expect that discount
   retail would ever be a career?

   The problem is the lack of higher paying jobs in other sectors of the
   economy. I thought we always expected discount retail to be like fast

     The National Association of Part-Time and Temporary Employees
     (NAPTE) is a registered nonprofit voluntary membership organization
     dedicated to advancing the economic and social interests of all
     people working on a part-time, contractual, or temporary basis.
     NAPTE is a nonpartisan independent association founded in 1994. It
     is presently headquartered in suburban Kansas City.

     NAPTE was founded by temps and part-time workers for non-traditional
     workers. [264]The event that prompted the creation of NAPTE was when
     employees who were hired as regular part-time workers with some
     benefits were conveniently re-classified as corporate temps with no
     benefits. This re-classification of employment status while "legal"
     was the impetus to start the organization. As corporate temps they
     were paid less per hour than regular employees. This is "economic
     discrimination." Unfortunately there are some employers that use
     non-traditional work schedules to avoid providing vital pro-rated
     benefits. Flexibility that is fair for all works best.

     The "re-engineering" of the workplace and globalization of commerce
     means that portable benefits need to be provided that people can
     transfer from one job to another. NAPTE offers some of these type of
     benefits.

   Years ago, my wife and I were on a road trip somewhere in New Mexico
   and  desperately needed socks.  The only store we could find near the
   interstate was a Walmart.  I had a dim view of Walmart's labor record
   at home and overseas even in those days, but hey, we were stuck.

   So we went in and bought the socks.  At the exit, a security guard
   stopped my wife, searched every bag we had and demanded our receipt
   which he checked against those pricy socks we had purchased.

   Prior to his stopping us, during his stopping us, and following it, a
   steady stream of white customers passed by unchallenged.

   My wife is black.

   That was the last time either of us shopped at Walmart.

       and allows the employer not to have to account for long-term labor
       expense commitments.  You can terminate at will and not have to
       bear the unemployment insurance costs (they are not your employee,
       they are the agency's employees), if the employee is pregnant, you
       don't bear the FMLA responsibilities, the temp agency is the
       employer, etc.
       It's true it costs more upfront, but the reason companies like
       WalMart go to temp agencies is either a sign of union busting or
       pre-union busting, or a signal of a major financial weakness in the
       corporation or a trend to damaging weakness that they are trying to
       fix before it becomes public and ruins them with investors.   I
       suspect it is both.
       Again, the only protection workers have is unionization.  This goes
       for temp agency workers, as well.

 The good news... ([304]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [305]JeffW, [306]historys mysteries, [307]Tim DeLaney

   ...is that these practices are unsustainable.  WalMart is committing
   suicide - death by a thousand little cuts, as it were.

   By favoring non-dedicated workers (part timers and temps, neither of
   whom have any reason to be 'loyal' employees), WalMart is ensuring that
   their stores will not be properly stocked, recovered, or cleaned - a
   phenomenon we are already seeing.  This drives sales down even if your
   customer count remains stable.  So to cut costs, they cut more labor
   and the cycle accelerates.

   It's a myopia that dominates retail.  Very few retail CEOs don't
   understand that their product isn't the crap they sell in their
   stores... It's the STORES!  And it is the people in your stores that
   will give you a good product.

   WalMart deserves to fail, and maybe their failure will be a lesson to
   other retail muckity mucks - though I doubt they'll learn from it.

 Why choose this guy? ([322]0+ / 0-)
       [323]Jason Furman thinks Walmart is a "progressive success story."
       Here's a sample of Furmanomics:

     "By acting in the interests of its shareholders, Wal-Mart has
     innovated and expanded competition, resulting in huge benefits for
     the American middle class and even proportionately larger benefits
     for moderate-income Americans."
       Expanded the competition? by cutting workers hours, the inevitable
       effect being, more people living with incoms ate poverty level ?!?
       But that's okay because Walmart prices are kept low. WTF kind of
       reasoning is that.
       Why not pay people a living wage to begin with?

       They don't try to guilt the viewer into changing his opinion of

       Walmart's exploitation are motivated by snobbery or, perhaps,
       racism.
       They are basically saying "don't judge me(Walmart worker) from your

   If there are plenty of good jobs elsewhere, Walmart will lose any good
   workers they have. Walmart thrives because we have never fixed the JOBS

     Don't you love that Walmart is like "we're using more temp workers

   The bit was that at some point in the future, McDonalds would go out of
   business because by then everyone in America would have worked at one
   at some point (w/ the implication that anyone who had ever worked there
   subsequently stopped eating there).
