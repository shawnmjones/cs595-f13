   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [39]Tagging tips - [40]Search For Tags - [41]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [42]Civil
   Rights, [43]Community, [44]Congress, [45]Culture, [46]Economy,
   [47]Education, [48]Elections, [49]Energy, [50]Environment, [51]Health
   Care, [52]International, [53]Labor, [54]Law, [55]Media, [56]Meta,
   [57]National Security, [58]Science, [59]Transportation, or [60]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([61]California, [62]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   About some Farm Movement rallies from the '70s and '80s. Despite that I
   don't like my writing style for being clunky and overly familiar to me,
   being picked on by English teachers, and my spotty history with diaries
   here.

       Plus the Farm Movement can be a little warty. On one hand Jesse
       Jackson flirted with it to bring some white faces into the Rainbow
       Coalition. On the other hand, after being snubbed by both Majors,
       the opportunistic Posse Comitatus weaseled in enough to ruin it for
       everybody.

 Administration steps in to overturn Apple ban ([142]0+ / 0-)

     Administration steps in to overturn Apple ban

     The Obama administration halted a ban on older models of iPhones and
     iPads in a rare presidential move to overturn a decision by the
     International Trade Commission.

     The announcement Saturday broke from a long tradition of
     administrations not intervening when the ITC issues import bans on
     products. The last time a ban was overturned was in 1987.

     U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said he would stop both an
     import ban and a cease-and-desist order that would have required
     Apple to remove the products from its shelves.

     In his letter to ITC Chairman Irving Williamson, Froman said the
     ability to license patents that are part of essential industry
     standards is "an important element of the administration's policy of
     promoting innovation and economic progress." One Samsung patent
     involved in the case is part of industry standards.
