Long lines at the polls stir calls in Congress for election reform

   By Mike Lillis - 11/11/12 04:00 PM ET
   [122]Tweet

   A growing number of lawmakers want Congress to step in to streamline
   voters' trips to the polls.

   Although warnings of voter fraud generated far more discussion leading
   up to Tuesday's elections, enormous lines in many districts turned out
   to be the much greater threat to the process, as hours-long waits
   greeted voters in Florida, Virginia, Maryland, Wisconsin and elsewhere.

   The delays have stirred questions about why the United States can't
   make it easier to vote, stoked accusations of voter suppression in
   minority districts and renewed the debate over Washington's
   responsibility to safeguard an efficient process.

   Now, just days after the polls closed, a number of Democrats say
   Congress should intervene to "normalize" voting nationwide and ensure
   the snags at the polls in 2012 don't plague elections down the line.

   "This ought not to be difficult. This is not rocket science," Rep.
   Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said in a phone interview Friday. "We've got to
   figure out how to clean up federal elections."

   Rep. Jim Moran, another Virginia Democrat, echoed that message, saying
   the delays are "unforgivable in a modern society."

   "It's a form of voter suppression," Moran said Friday by phone. "For
   people to have to give up hours out of their work day ... how is that
   different than a poll tax?"

   The rash of delays makes it "incumbent on the Congress" to step in and
   "normalize the process" nationwide, Moran said.

   Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), senior Democrat on the House Oversight and
   Government Reform Committee, also weighed in this week with a damning
   statement about the nature of Tuesday's elections -- and a call for
   federal reforms.

   "We need to address this problem," Cummings said Thursday in an email.
   "There is no reason in this day and age that we should run our
   elections like a third-world country."

   Although turnout at the polls this year fell short of the 2008 numbers,
   a long list of precincts reported huge lines that left voters standing
   as long as nine hours -- sometimes, literally, out in the cold -- to
   cast a ballot.

   The bottleneck was blamed on the sheer number of voters, long and
   confusing ballots, a dearth of voting machines and a shortage of
   workers available to guide voters through the process.

   The problems weren't overlooked by President Obama, who in his victory
   speech vowed to seek a solution.

   "I want to thank every American who participated in this election --
   whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very
   long time," the president said early Wednesday morning in Chicago. "By
   the way, we have to fix that."

   He didn't define "we," but Connolly, Cummings and Moran all suggested
   at least part of the job should fall to Congress.

   Each lawmaker has personal reasons to get involved.

   In northern Virginia, voters in Connolly's and Moran's districts faced
   some of the longest lines in the nation. Waits extended to five hours
   in Connolly's Dumfries precinct, for instance, while the congressman's
   staff passed out water and encouraged constituents to stick it out.

   Connolly said the long lines and confusion are "absolutely
   preventable." He's eyeing legislation to create uniform rules governing
   voting in all states, including early voting standards, registration
   criteria and proof-of-identity guidelines.

   "We just have a crazy-quilt electoral system in the world's greatest
   democracy," he said. Tuesday's experience, he added, "really put a fire
   in my gut on this issue."

   Moran said he wants to craft a similar proposal, including more federal
   resources for voting machines, poll workers and training. But he's also
   clear that he'll need to find a GOP co-sponsor -- "otherwise, it's dead
   in the water" -- and he's not guaranteeing the success of that search
   in the hyper-partisan environment of Capitol Hill.

   Cummings conceded the "challenge" of crafting reforms that would be
   applied to 50 different state election boards. "But one key step we can
   take," he added, "is to create national standards to provide greater
   access to early voting across the country, which would help reduce
   lines and enable more people to cast their ballots."

   The fight over that issue was particularly pronounced in Florida.
   Republican Gov. Rick Scott had refused to extend early voting even as
   residents waited in long lines to cast early ballots. The episode led
   former Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican-turned-independent who backed
   Obama this year, to call Scott's actions "wrong" and "indefensible."

   Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) said many of the delays in Florida
   resulted from the length of the ballot, which included
   "non-interpretable, page-long constitutional amendments" championed by
   the state's Republican legislature.

   "I think they were done intentionally," Wilson said Friday by phone.

   She emphasized that Congress's role in the election process is not to
   try to solve every problem in every state, but, more broadly, "to make
   sure people are not disenfranchised."

   Moran had a slightly different take. He said Tuesday's elections are
   clear evidence that the state problems are both widespread and, at
   times, politically motivated. He said they demand congressional
   attention.

   "If things weren't so bad in so many states, this wouldn't be an
   issue," Moran said. "It's not that we didn't anticipate the turnout,
   it's that we weren't prepared for it."
