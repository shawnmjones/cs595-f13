   Published on Apr 27, 2013

   President Obama says that because Republicans in Congress allowed a
   series of harmful, automatic budget cutsâcalled the sequesterâto take
   effect, important programs like Head Start are now forced to reduce
   their services. After travelers were stuck for hours in airports and on
   planes this past week, members of Congress passed a temporary band-aid
   measure to stop the cuts that impact airlines â but they must do more
   to stop cuts to vital services for the American people. That's why it's
   time for a balanced approach to deficit reduction that makes smarter
   cuts and reforms in the tax code while creating jobs and strengthening
   the middle class.
