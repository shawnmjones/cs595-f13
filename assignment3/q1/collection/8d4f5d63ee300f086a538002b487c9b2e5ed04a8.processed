Keeping a bipartisan promise

   President Obama holds his first cabinet meeting in April 2009.

   While we wait for the official announcement from President Obama about
   Chuck Hagel's nomination, it's worth pausing to note the larger
   context: as a candidate, Obama promised a bipartisan team, and whether
   one approves of the goal or not, it's a promise the president has kept.

   Traditionally, this hasn't been much of an issue -- presidents were
   largely expected to create cabinets from their own party -- but Clinton
   added some Republicans to his team in the 1990s, including naming
   William Cohen to head the Pentagon, and when George W. Bush ran in
   2000, he presented himself as a relative moderate by assuring voters
   there would be a Democrat in his cabinet, too.

   Bush later tapped Norm Mineta to lead the Department of Transportation.

   But even before Obama nominates Hagel as Secretary of Defense, as best
   as I can tell, this president has given more administration positions
   to Republicans than any modern president has given to members of the
   other party.
     __________________________________________________________________

   For all the talk on the right about Obama being a bitter partisan, the
   president made former Republican Rep. John McHugh the Secretary of the
   Army; he made former Republican Rep. Ray LaHood the Secretary of
   Transportation; he put former Republican Rep. Jim Leach in charge of
   the National Endowment for the Humanities; he named former Republican
   Gov. Jon Huntsman as U.S. Ambassador to China; and he put former
   Republican Rep. Anne Northup in charge of the Consumer Product Safety
   Commission.

   Obama also kept Bush's Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, in his post,
   and for a while, nominated former Republican Sen. Judd Gregg as his
   Commerce Secretary. Indeed, Hagel has already been on the White House
   team, serving as a co-chairman of the President's Intelligence Advisory
   Board.

   To be sure, opinions can vary widely as to whether this is a positive
   development or not.

   There's a credible school of thought that suggests if Americans wanted
   Republicans in key administration posts, they would have elected a
   Republican president. For that matter, it's not as if Obama's GOP's
   detractors are giving him credit for crafting such a bipartisan team --
   the right still considers the president a radical, left-wing partisan
   who refuses to reach out to Republicans, all evidence to the contrary
   notwithstanding.

   Still, for good or ill, this is largely what Obama promised the public
   four years ago, and at least in theory, it's what Americans say they
   like -- a leader who's not afraid to surround himself with a diverse
   group of advisors, including folks from the other party.

   Hagel tells the truth about the wars and Israel, so Republicans don't
   like him.

   Bloomberg tells the truth about Climate Change, so the far right
   doesn't like him either.

   Obama should challenge Bloomberg to put up or shut up on climate
   change- and agree to run the EPA and use it to ram through confiscatory
   fines on export of CO2 polluting energy- whether that is XL pipeline
   oil or LNG fracked in the US.

   These major sources of revenue should be directed to payment for
   disasters, and for research and promotion of green technologies (such
   as upgrading refining to output only Hydrogen, with carbon extracted
   sequestered into deep undersea basalt formations (such as the vast ones
   off the Pacific Northwest coast). At these depths, the CO2 is liquid
   and heavier than water.

   Conversion to a green energy economy can be done using market forces,
   not fighting them. When energy companies receive a clear signal that
   this is the most profitable line of development, US industry will be
   the ally, not opponent of efforts to slow CO2 production.

   Hey Steve,

   What is Bill Richardson doing with Google/Novell/Apple's Eric Schmidt

   Huntsman's service in Obama's administration hobbled his presidential
   run for his rabidly partisan party nicely, didn't it? But he was a good
   Ambassador, apparently. As LaHood has been as Sec of Transportation.

   Huntsman was a wonderful ambassador to China, and speaks fluent
   Chinese. He was also an excellent Governor, and well respected. I would
   have voted for him for president, frankly!

   Of course, he got Borked by the likes of Michele Bachman and her
   T-Party subversives. They have a strong dislike for intelligent people,
   and try to ruin them.

   See that's the thing here...this isn't about party affiliation as much
   as it's about Smart v. Stupid.

   The problem isn't that there aren't any competent Republicans or
   intellectual conservatives it's that they have to keep a low profile
   and pander to the lowest common denominator, which in this case is FOX
   News viewers.

   The Republican party has waged such an effective war over the years of
   trying to peg Democrats as "Liberal College Boys" and "Elite Snobs"
   while trying to portray themselves as Regan's "Everyman" and the second
   coming of Gene Autry that they can't demonstrate any kind of overt
   intelligence or education themselves. These days they are more likely
   to say "William F. Buckley...Who's that? Is he one of those pinko
   liberal America Haters?"

   Chuck Hagel is a fine choice for this position. Of course, the GOP,
   like Lindsay Graham and his ilk will fight this. Why? Well, of course,
   first because that's what they DO! And secondly,

   beacuse Hagel tells the truth, and wants to cut back the bloated
   defence budget and make the military a finely honed, high tec machine,
   as it should be. Graham and that group make a ton of lobbyists money
   from these unnecessary military expenses. They'll have Hagel turned
   into the mad bomber or the anti-Christ by the time they're done
   spouting their lies. They think THEY can pick the President's choices.

   I don't think so. That's why we reelected Obama.

   Not to mention that McCain and Graham have lost all credibility (Not
   that either of them ever had any, IMO)

   My problem isn't that he's picking from both parties, my problem is
   "are the people he's picking from the other side" giving him the best

   Republicans still do not understand that the election is over, that the
   American people have spoken, and that their brand of hate speech and
   extremism is on the way out the proverbial door. Yet the attempts to
   embarrass the president at the expense of a functioning government will
   not stop until these knuckleheads end up at impeachment. Conservatives
   are fluent in a kind of toxic and pervasive hypocrisy that this country
   has never seen before. Obstruction is not a tool to be used sparingly
   for these GOP clowns; it is the only way they know how to operate. -

   Barney Frank [44]strongly opposed Hagel's appointment just a few weeks
   ago...I guess before he realized opposition might get in the way of him
   being appointed Senator in Kerry's place...then he backed off that
   statement...what strong values, huh. Both sides play politics with
   EVERYTHING!

   Doug, you tried to correct my math (which was accurate) in a previous
   post and now you want me to "provide some evidence" despite the fact I
   have a link in my comment to Frank's comment as reported in the
   Huffington Post (I try to provide neutral or left leaning sources
   because most here without reading dismiss other sources). I don't know
   what other evidence you want????

   I'm not a troll, either, been here for a while and provide sources to
   the vast majority of my comments.

   Given that the Israelis are in the middle of an election campaign that
   is likely to make their government even more pro-fascist and
   racial/religious supremacist than it already is (proving that Jews can
   indeed become Nazis) is more than time to rein in the AIPAC
   Israel-Uber-Alles lobby. That Hagel knows that the American interests
   are not synonymous with the annexationist, pro-apartheid policies of
   current Israeli politics makes him the best candidate.

   The Israelis need to go back and read the prophets in the Torah, the
   ones who point out that the Jews brought on every disaster they
   suffered back then when they failed to act in accordance with their
   religious morality. The one thing I know about that area is that
   racial/religious supremacy has never been considered a virtue in
   Judaism - since they used to know well what happened to them in such
   situations. But they're bringing on the seeds of their own destruction
   again, just as they did at the time of the destruction of the first
   temple. Someone needs to find a way to save them from themselves.

     "But even before Obama nominates Hagel as Secretary of Defense, as
     best as I can tell, this president has given more administration
     positions to Republicans than any modern president has given to
     members of the other party."

   It's bought him precisely zero good-will from the diseased minds of
   Republicans. And it's antagonized his base (which he seems to enjoy).
   And Anne Northup is flat-out incompetent.

   Well said. Lord knows we are being dictated to enough right here in the
   GOP caucus. They refuse to believe that the election is over and we
   won. We don't need Israel's answer to George Bush telling us what to do
   on top of that!

   The thing that will probably kill the Hagel nomination is AIPAC, which
   is one of the most powerful PAC's in Washington. Israel has an
   inordinate amount of power in the congress. President Obama tried to be
   friends with the republicans as soon as he was inaugurated, but they
   rejected his overtures. The de facto head of the republicans, Rush
   Limbaugh, stated that he hoped Obama failed and his party has been
   trying to ensure his failure ever since.

   Anne Northup was never the chair of the CPSC; that post went to Inez
   Tenenbaum. Northup was chosen because as an independent commission like
   the FCC or SEC, the CPSC must by statute have members of both parties.
   By long-standing tradition, members of the minority party on
   commissions are recommended by that party's leader in the Senate, i.e.
   McConnell.

   Hagel never seemed like a rocket scientist. He's just an ordinary
   Republican with the prejudices common to his race, class and
   geographical origin. He does seem to have seen what a lot of veterans
   of wars see- that war is something to be avoided if possible. McCain
   and Graham never had the opportunity to learn that. They are only too
   happy to condemn other people's children to death as cannon fodder.
