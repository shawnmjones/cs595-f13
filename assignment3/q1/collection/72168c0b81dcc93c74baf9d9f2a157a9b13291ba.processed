   Daily Kos Radio logo

   In fact, Daily Kos Radio is not live at all today. But just in case you
   wish it was and happen to have missed yesterday's show, hit the play
   button below, close your eyes, and pretend:

   IFRAME:
   [29]http://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/2334087/height/302/
   width/540/theme/legacy/direction/no/autoplay/no/autonext/no/thumbnail/y
   es/preload/no/no_addthis/no/

   We'll be back on the air LIVE again next Tuesday, following the
   Memorial Day weekend. Stay safe and stay low! There are a lot of guns
   in need of cleaning out there.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [42]Tagging tips - [43]Search For Tags - [44]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

 Random Notes ([71]0+ / 0-)
       1]Enjoy the long weekend.
       2]I enjoy your program very much and listen when I can at work on
       one of the varied ways you have provided.  I also like Wink and
       Justice on Aftershow quite a lot.
       3]My company in their divine wisdom block Sticher and your direct
       stream from their wifi (as well as Pandora, some of my favorite
       radio stations and of course any low class sites like Facebook,
       Shopping and anything with too much cleavage.)
       4]SHOUTcast has not, as of yet, been blocked and also plays your
       programming...you should give the folks a shout out.
       5]If you ever need an experienced music blogger to talk/write
       classic folk/rock/blues music for a Kos show please consider my
       long background writing for school newspaper, this site and, in a
       previous lifetime, songs.

 Thanks! ([74]0+ / 0-)
       Wink & Justice put on a good show!
       I never know exactly where the show is going to take me, but I'll
       certainly keep your offer in mind. I do sometimes actually play
       music on the show, though I tend to limit it to material actually
       written and/or performed by Daily Kos community members. I've
       played Crashing Vor's music and political ads (they make great
       breaks for me, when needed), and the band The Union Electric, the
       lineup of which includes Kossack dissonantdissident. So if that's
       something you might consider contributing to the show, I could
       certainly work that in there, if you like.
