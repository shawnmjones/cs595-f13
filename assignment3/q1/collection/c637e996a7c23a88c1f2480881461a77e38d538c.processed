[22]House Republicans reveal what they plan on doing after their summer break

   Man takes a nap on a bench
   In about two weeks, House Republicans will begin their summer vacation,
   taking nearly the entire month of August off and returning to work
   after Labor Day. And what will their schedule look like [29]after
   returning from vacation?

     After taking almost the entire month of August off, House leadership
     has penciled in just nine workdays for September.

   To be fair, September has just 30 days, and they're already spending
   the first two of those days on vacation. If you subtract the 8 weekend
   days, that leaves just 20 workdays left in the month. So it's not like
   they're spending all of their time screwing around doing
   nothing--they're only taking off 11 of the first 20 workdays after
   their vacation.

   It makes sense, if you think about it, because everybody needs a
   transition between vacation and really diving back into work, right?
   Plus, it's not like they're doing [30]anything while on the job anyway,
   so it probably doesn't matter anyway.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [41]Tagging tips - [42]Search For Tags - [43]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [44]Civil
   Rights, [45]Community, [46]Congress, [47]Culture, [48]Economy,
   [49]Education, [50]Elections, [51]Energy, [52]Environment, [53]Health
   Care, [54]International, [55]Labor, [56]Law, [57]Media, [58]Meta,
   [59]National Security, [60]Science, [61]Transportation, or [62]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([63]California, [64]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Recommended by:
          [193]Pilotshark

   what happens if House Democrats show up to work without House
   Republicans there? Is there a quorum required to pass laws and get work
   done? I'm guessing yes, but even if there is a required quorum to vote,
   is there a required quorum to debate? And if so, does that mean that
   the majority in the House can completely shut down the House simply by
   refusing to show up, with no recourse? And still get paid?

   My country, right or wrong; if right, to be kept right; and if wrong,
   to be set right.

   get their attention, or is it a lost cause.  Where would I go to make
   such a suggestion where it will make a difference?  Move on?  White
   House petitions?  This is really starting to piss me off.  The GOP =
   the real welfare queens.

   The GOP will destroy anything they can't own.

 Well, the Constitution says they gotta get paid ([273]0+ / 0-)
       no matter what. So we can't take their pay AWAY.
       But the Constitution does not say HOW MUCH they get paid.
       Drop them down to minimum wage when they aren't on the floor or in
       committee meetings.
       And if they want to filibuster...make it only a talking filibuster,
       which only pays minimum wage too.

 Have to leave time in the schedule ([277]0+ / 0-)

   ..for all expenses paid ALEC meetings in 5-star Caribbean resorts and
   fund-raising from Wall Street.

   It's hard work being a Republican congressman.

   ..and they're all made out of ticky-tacky and they all look just the
   same.

 It's really hard to govern ([280]0+ / 0-)

   if you don't believe in government.

   by [281]longtail on [282]Fri Jul 19, 2013 at 12:53:34 PM PDT



 If Republicans want to take time off ([283]0+ / 0-)

   then just be quiet and let them. Do we really like the results when
   they get busy legislating?
