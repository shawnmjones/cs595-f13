     * Today's [29]comic by Ruben Bolling is [30]Chagrin Falls -- Gavin
       has nothing to hide from the NSA

   [31]Cartoon by Ruben Bolling - &nbsp;Chagrin Falls - Gavin has nothing
   to hide from the NSA
     * [32]Man indicted for attempted extortion of Mitt Romney: A federal
       grand jury in Nashville, Tennessee, indicted Michael Mancil Brown
       on six counts of wire fraud and six count of extortion Wednesday
       for allegedly attempting to extort a million dollars from the GOP
       presidential nominee. Brown claimed he had stolen copies of
       Romney's 2010 tax returns from the accounting firm PriceWaterhouse.
       He didn't actually have the returns.
     * [33]These little piggies are going wheeeee all the way home:

     A farmer in Washington state has cooked up a cannabis concoction for
     his pigs. Part flavor experiment, part green recycling, these
     "pot"-bellied pigs are being sold at market.

     * [34]Texas ex-warden remembers his 140 or so executions:

     Charles Thomas O'Reilly supported capital punishment when he oversaw
     his first Texas execution. And he still supported it after his
     100th.

     In six years as warden of the Huntsville Unit, the prison that
     houses Texas' death chamber, O'Reilly supervised about 140
     executions -- more than any other warden in state history.

     Now retired, he reflected on his career this week as the nation's
     busiest death penalty state as the state executed its 500th inmate
     since resuming capital punishment in 1982.

     The 62-year-old said he has no regrets about a process he considered
     to be a relatively unemotional and small part of his job.

     * [35]Study: 21% of households emit 50% of CO[2].
     * [36]A decade ago, marriage equality didn't yet exist in any state:

     By Aug. 1, same-sex marriage will be legal in California, Delaware,
     Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Washington -- all
     states where it was not legal one year earlier.

     There are about 59 million people living in these seven states,
     which means that the availability of same-sex marriage in the United
     States as a percentage of population will have more than doubled
     within the year. As of early last year, same-sex marriage was legal
     only in Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York,
     Vermont and the District of Columbia, which have 35 million people
     among them.

     * [37]Federal judge unimpressed with government's reasoning on no-fly
       list. The Department of Homeland Security and FBI have a secret
       list of more than 20,000 people who are too dangerous to allow to
       board a commercial plane or ship but not so dangerous they need to
       be arrested. It amounts, the ACLU has argued in a lawsuit
       representing 13 Americans, including four veterans, to a kind of
       detention. The civil rights group [38]states:

     We're asking the court to finally put a check on the government's
     use of a blacklist that denies Americans the ability to fly without
     giving them the explanation or fair hearing that the Constitution
     requires. It's a question of basic fairness," said ACLU Staff
     Attorney Nusrat Choudhury, one of the ACLU attorneys who will argue
     the case Friday in Portland [Oregon]. "It does not make our country
     safer to ban people from flying without giving them an
     after-the-fact redress process that allows them to correct the
     errors that led to their mistaken inclusion on the list."

     * [39]About friggin' time:

     The National Institutes of Health [Wednesday] announced that 310
     captive chimpanzees will be retired from medical research. Genetic
     and behavioral studies may continue in sanctuary settings, but no
     longer will those chimpanzees be forced to undergo procedures that
     would be unconscionable if performed in humans.

     Up to 50 chimpanzees will be kept in reserve for possible use in
     future medical experiments, a likelihood that disturbs animal
     welfare advocates. That decision will, however, be revisited every
     five years. It's possible that government-supported medical
     experiments on chimpanzees will come to an end altogether.

   On today's [42]Kagro in the Morning show, heading into a week-plus
   break, Greg Dworkin and Armando help round up our discussion of the
   NSA/Snowden story, the IRS story, the SCOTUS decisions, the Texas
   filibuster fight, and the revival of CNN's much-maligned Crossfire, and
   more. The other big topic of today's show: the apparent evolution of
   Edward Snowden's views on national security leaking. And did Glenn
   Greenwald undergo an evolution of his own on his views on executive
   reaction to the Supreme Court's apparent insistence on reigning in of
   claimes of interent national security powers?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [53]Tagging tips - [54]Search For Tags - [55]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   indicted by Fed Grand Jury

   [179]http://www.usatoday.com/...

     A federal grand jury in Boston has returned a 30-count indictment
     against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, charging him with three deaths in the
     April 15 Boston Marathon bombings and the killing of a campus police
     officer three days later.

     The 19-year-old Cambridge, Mass., student is also charged with using
     a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and the use of a
     firearm resulting in death.

     Tsarnaev, who faces a possible death sentence if convicted, is
     scheduled to be arraigned July 10.

     Federal authorities were expected to make a formal announcement of
     the charges at 3 p.m. Thursday in Boston.

       a roadside bomb is not a "weapon of mass destruction". All the
       other things are OK, let a murderer be tried as a murderer, but
       this invoking a "WMD" is a continuation if the dangerous trend of

       you do, but this was a textbook improvised explosive device.
       Yeah, it is a destructive device, "mass destruction" seems
       counter-intuitive but that is the law.
       The same law would tell you that marijuana is the most dangerous
       drug available. They'll tell you a lot of stupid things, actually.
       They are pretty scummy about that.
       But, the point here is fuck Tsnarev. He went out of his way to kill

       person that it did and plenty probably think you should be lectured

       but what troubles me it thsi WMD thing, quite irrespective of the
       Tsarnaev case. The term WMD is not some loose term, it has - or
       used to have - a very specific meaning that had international and
       diplomatic implications. Remember that Bush made up the pretext for
       invading Iraq on their "tying to acquire WMD". If now a roadside
       bomb is a WMD, then every state in the world and every criminal
       gang or guerilla group or simple farmer if need be can suddenly
       accused to having WMD and be treated as a state enemy. The
       expression IED is perfect fine - its technical newspeak, and doesnt
       carry legal and political implications.
       that is just my point -- allowing loaded and implication laden
       terms to be applied to activities that they never were intended to
       cover, makes ultimately everything people do amenable to state
       reinterpretation in the harshest light - whenever it is convenient.
       this is no different from "abortion is murder" (which it isnt) or
       "corporations are people" (which they arent). Sure, interested
       politicians come up with that but it needs to be fought, not
       accepted.  Roadside bombs are not WMD any more than an assault
       rifle is one, with which you can kill scores of people, as has been
       demonstrated.

 For the history buffs who always wanted to know ([253]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [254]wishingwell

   what it was like to grow up in Eastern Germany, here you can read the
   printed editions of three major former East German Newspapers.
   Germany's Center for Contemporary History (ZZF), with support from the
   Berlin State Library and the Fraunhofer Society, a research
   organization, has spent the last four years on the project, digitizing
   every single issue of the papers between May 21, 1945 and December 31,
   1990. It's all online, as of the end of May.

   [255]Digitizing the GDR: East German Papers Offer Glimpse of History

     An overview of the role print media played in the Communist German
     Democratic Republic (GDR) is now more accessible than ever before,
     thanks to an archival project that has digitized the full texts of
     three major East German newspapers and made them available for free
     on the Web. Anyone can now rifle through some 40 years of East
     German history as printed in the pages of Neues Deutschland, Neue
     Zeit, a socialist theoretical journal, and Berliner Zeitung, the
     only East German paper to regain credibility and circulation after
     reunification.

   Funny to see what they wrote the day the Berlin Wall fell:

     On Nov. 10, 1989 -- the day after the Berlin Wall officially fell,
     sending thousands of East Berliners stampeding through open
     checkpoints to see the other half of the city for the first time in
     30 years -- East Germany's major newspapers didn't have much to say
     about it. Berliner Zeitung and Neue Zeit ran small articles about
     "new travel regulations." Neues Deutschland, the official Communist
     Party mouthpiece buried the story at the bottom of the page under
     articles with headlines such as "Fourth Communist Party Conference
     Called for December 15-17, 1989" and "Information on the Policy of
     Renewal and the Party's New Thinking.

   Heh. be careful what you read ... you could be profiled as a communist
   ;-)
