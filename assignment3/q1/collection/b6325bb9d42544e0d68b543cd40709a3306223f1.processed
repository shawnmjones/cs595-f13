[24]DOJ secretly obtained AP phone records

   Telephone
   [30]Ugh:

     The Justice Department secretly obtained two months of telephone
     records of reporters and editors for The Associated Press in what
     the news cooperative's top executive called a "massive and
     unprecedented intrusion" into how news organizations gather the
     news.

     The records obtained by the Justice Department listed incoming and
     outgoing calls, and the duration of each call, for the work and
     personal phone numbers of individual reporters, general AP office
     numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and the main
     number for AP reporters in the House of Representatives press
     gallery, according to attorneys for the AP.

     In all, the government seized those records for more than 20
     separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April
     and May of 2012. The exact number of journalists who used the phone
     lines during that period is unknown but more than 100 journalists
     work in the offices whose phone records were targeted on a wide
     array of stories about government and other matters.

   Apparently, the records were sought in connection with a probe on the
   leak of information regarding a foiled terror plot, so the goal here
   was to determine the AP's sources. But the reason for the surveillance
   is beside the point. Even if it's legitimate for the government to
   investigate how it leaked information, there are limits to what it
   should be able to do in the course of that investigation. And certainly
   spying on the press is on the list of things it shouldn't do.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       the elected officials in the Republican Party.
       The GOP have put together a coalition of fear and mistrust - fear
       and mistrust of government.  Benghazi is a story that plays to
       those fears - that the government is not telling the truth about
       counter-terrorism efforts and that the government can't be trusted
       to keep us safe.  Democratically-controlled government, that is.
       Weave in this thread of going after leaks and potential
       whistleblowers in a terrorism investigation and the GOP has even
       more fuel with which to feed their fire.
       Forget about the fact that the Bush Administration made this all
       possible and that the Obama Administration is taking full advantage
       of powers that Bush left behind - the GOP audience and others who
       might be disenchanted with the Democrats are ripe to latch onto
       this kind of government spying on Americans story.

       Disapproval is legitimate - I am just saying that it gives
       legitimacy to the Benghazi conspiracy theorists in that it can be
       used as a way of "proving" that the Obama Administration would do
       anything to "cover up" their dealings in the counter-terrorism
       arena.
       To me, one of the most frightening aspects of the Bush
       Administration was the lack of leaks - because leaks keep the
       government honest.  The Obama Administration's vigorous pursuit of
       whistleblowers is equally frightening to me.  I think that this
       story about AP is really troubling - the trouble is that this story
       is also a real opening for the totally insane Benghazi people to
       gain credibility.

   segments on Democracy Now, these powers have been expanded during the
   past several years.  Heck, just heard the other day that there is now
   an effort to attempt to include 'instant messaging' in some type of
   more reliable government surveillance scheme, LOL!

   I think that this should be of concern to everyone, frankly.  No matter
   which Party is 'in power.'

   Remember, if we have stringent austerity measures implemented over the
   next several years, there's a real chance that Repubs will take control
   of the White House in 2016.  Imagine if they continue (or for that
   matter, Dems) to expand these powers.

   My peaceful University town [large state university, but in a small
   town setting] has patrolmen who look like their 'swat' team members.
   Our local Social Security Office (to my dismay, as a former federal
   employee) has an armed City policeman at the door!

       I say this because Warren was literally recruited by Dem

   And Jeff, the government wasn't spying on the press or putting them

       Yes, it wasn't real-time "surveillance", but it was a non-court
       reviewed vacuum up of general business office and personal phone
       (including personal cells) covering up to 100 reporters working on
       the whole array of AP Washington DC, New York and Hartford CT
       reporting, and it wasn't disclosed to the AP, much less the
       reporters whose phone records were scooped up, until a year after
       the covered two months.
       So, yes, it was not only a SECRET gathering of records, it was also
       not authorized by a lawful search warrant.
       Coupled with the fact that the [446]FBI and DoJ believe they can

       who has been following this situation since May believes it was

        A lot of different govt. officials can sign off on those.

     Update: Actually, the letter itself doesn't say they were

     NSLs are a likely candidate.

       This is a big deal. A really big deal, especially since the most
       important detail about that whole operation was a detail that was
       leaked by John Brennan, not the AP.  AP contacted the White House
       about the story they were going to publish. White House told them
       they were going to make an official announcement on Tuesday. AP
       published on Monday. Then John Brennan disclosed some details that
       became a big problem, supposedly, and the AP never reported on
       that, though they got blamed for it, even though the facts are
       there and can be checked from the story they reported.
       This is a witch hunt.  I don't understand exactly why, except maybe
       that AP doesn't toe the line.

       Since this almost certainly never even reached the level of the

 Just because the FBI interviewed Brennan, ([704]0+ / 0-)
       it doesn't mean that the DoJ was not leading the quest to request
       the phone records.  The lawyers at DoJ could have initiated the
       request without the FBI being a part of that decision/process.  I
       don't point this out to hold the FBI harmless as much as to point
       out that lawyers who should be more "sensitive" to Constitutional
       questions being fingered as the originators of this information
       grab gives the story more weight and potentially inflates the
       scandal.
       Police - which is what the FBI effectively are - are not really
       trained in the law and nuances therein - lawyers, on the other
       hand, are and thus are more culpable in these situations.
       I will add that spying on a news organization like AP is no small
       potatoes - this kind of initiative would never be held down at the
       level of the FBI and not communicated up to the highest levels of
       DoJ - it is more likely that it rose even to the White House and

     An FBI investigation manual updated last year, obtained by the ACLU,
     says it's possible to warrantlessly obtain Americans' e-mail
     "without running afoul" of the Fourth Amendment.

   This is on top of what I believe has been a debate in the civil
   liberties community over law enforcement's contention that a
   prosecutor's or [723]law enforcement officer's request is enough "due
   process" to get whatever phone records they may be curious about (and
   any records swept up in a broad, "all records..." description -- "more

 This must be ([949]0+ / 0-)
       a misunderstanding and I'll answer anything you want to know.
       What I've said about the AP isn't a new topic on Kos.  It appeared
       in a [950]diary  a couple of weeks ago. By coincidence I had
       noticed something about AP a week earlier and I started looking for
       more information.  I learned that there was a lawsuit between the
       government and the AP that began a year ago.  Then  I exchanged
       comments with another Kossack last week about my observations of
       the AP decades ago and today.  As I said in that comment, my
       observation is that the organization's standards have declined
       along with the profession in general since I got my Journalism
       degree.  You may disagree with my observations or my opinion.  I
       think I have a reasonable and logical conclusion.
       Now that I look at my comments here today, maybe they look
       unserious. Of course it's a concern when the government oversteps
       its bounds, invades privacy, threatens free speech, spies on
       citizens.  Since I had researched the AP prior to this new story, I
       had some considerations that I haven't mentioned yet.  The way I
       look at every news event is always the same.  The government
       snooping on phone records is a piece of information that has a
       context.  It connects to other pieces of information.  When all the
       separate pieces and parts are assembled, the picture looks
       different. The alarming aspect of it can be understood better in
       its context and if a remedy is warranted, it becomes more apparent.
       Honestly, in this situation, I reserve judgement because I think
       there is still more to know. And my judgement only pertains to
       myself. If the organization broke the law or committed an offense I
       take it seriously because it does have some influence as a news
       outlet.  On the other side, I know that the President spoke a year
       ago directly about this case and his statement was very harsh.  I
       could find a link if needed.  He said zero tolerance for leakers
       and it sounded like he meant it.  He didn't spell out obviously how
       they'd be discovered and any sensible person has to question
       whether this was the wisest route.
       I know you're affiliated with Kos and I'm of no importance.  if you
       read any of my comments maybe you'll see that I reach out to people
       like a brother especially those who are hostile sometimes.  As I
       said, I will answer anything you want to know.

       its against the spirit of the law to attack the press, to chill the
       press, to fuck with the press, to harass the press, etc.
       but thats exactly what has been happening under Obama.
       Look at Josh Gerstein's articles.
       Look at the lack of articles by Siobhan Gorman. A fucking reporter
       who is scared so shitless she can't talk about the biggest story of
       her entire career.
       Look at what Jane Mayer wrote about the Drake case, and fuck that,
       look what she wrote about the Kiriakou case.
       stop splitting fucking hairs. Obama's whole presidency is a fucking
       failure to destroy the nazi horse shit that Bush put in place.
       the gist of this country is that the governmet are servants of the
       people, and that we were tired of Czars and Counts and Barons and

   As far as I can figure it out from [1354]the original story from the
   AP, this was never an investigation of some terrorist plot in progress,
   but instead it was aimed at the AP's sources right from the get-go.

     The government would not say why it sought the records. U.S.
     officials have previously said in public testimony that the U.S.
     attorney in Washington is conducting a criminal investigation into
     who may have leaked information contained in a May 7, 2012, AP story
     about a foiled terror plot.

   And they covered a LOT of communications!

     In all, the government seized those records for more than 20
     separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April
     and May of 2012. The exact number of journalists who used the phone
     lines during that period is unknown but more than 100 journalists
     work in the offices whose phone records were targeted on a wide
     array of stories about government and other matters.

       GOOD LUCK because there isnt one.
       its not illegal. theres only a tiny percentage of cases where its

       AND THEN the historical precedent of our Democratic Free Country
       That Is Not A Communist Nazi Shit Hole Full Of Skulls From The
       Fucking Killing Fields,
       is that its de-facto not illegal.
       During world war ii some isolationist asshole in Chicago published
       an actual story about how we had broken Japanese encryption codes.
       That, by itself, probably led to a bunch of dead US sailors and
       Marines because the Japanese then knew to switch their codes.
       Prosecution of that newspaper? No. In the middle of a war where
       400,000 Americans died? No. No no no. Not then.
       Oh, but now, someone leaked a little piece of information about
       some bizarrely convoluted technical detail of some contingency
       operation (because of course The Great O Doesnt Believe In War) in
       some place that none of use can even pronounce, somehow that is

       Within my lifetime the law has required Japanese-American citizens
       to march into interment camps here in the States.  During that same
       period, the law across most of Europe required citizens to turn in
       their Jewish neighbors -- not a single member of my family who was
       in Poland or Germany in 1939 survived that law.  The law today
       allows the President of the United States to order death warrants
       for U.S. citizens without a judge or jury.  The law today allows
       the government to imprison people indefinitely without trial.  It
       allows the government to target political groups (ACORN and the Tea
       Party, for example).  It allows industrialists to control both
       major political parties in this country.
       Of course, we're not anywhere near the level of abuse of power and
       abuse of rights that were seen in the last century, for which we
       should be thankful, but I'm still not entirely trusting of
       government, any government.  It's particularly disturbing that this
       president ran on a platform promising openness, and is governing

       sure you can find the whole story.  There's two sides.
       I have a compulsion about that.  In this case, the diary is telling
       part of a story and my natural inclination is to tell the other
       side.   It drives people nuts, because they want to cheer for their
       team.  Most of the time that's fine.  But there are certain topics
       that are important to me and I endeavor to broaden the discussion,
       and create more understanding.
       I'm not one sided but I'll never side with Republicans if that

 since when did the SEC have the power to spy ([1535]0+ / 0-)

   on US citizens?

   the SEC cannot even refer a successfull case against anyone involved in
   the CDO scam that caused the great recession, but im supposed to
   believe that it cares about the AP causing a tiny ass blip in the stock
   market?

   the stock market is like an ass pimple on the elephant that is the Bond
   Market and the SEC has done fuckall to reign in the abuses of that
   market that caused the crash of the world economy, leading to the
   biggest theft of taxpayer money in the history of this solar system.

   the only reason we know about the failures of the SEC and the CFTC and
   the Fed is because journalists dug into the muck and the mire and drew
   out the stories. The corruption, the revolving door between the
   regulators and industry, the never ending triumph of douchebag morons
   like Summers and Greenspan....

   The whole idea that the SEC should be able to 'go after' the media is
   fucking ludicrous. The SEC is supposed to regulate securities and
   corporations who deal in securities. It refers criminal cases to the
   FBI, which typically says 'thanks assholes, but we are too busy
   arresting whistleblowers' and sticks the files in a bin that nobody
   ever looks at again.

       The AP still does some straight news.  But when there's a big story
       like the Boston bomber capture, they throw out their principles and
       go hog wild to cash in.
       Example: on the weekend after Jahar Tsarnaev was captured they
       churned out story after story based on information they got from
       FBI sources that wanted to remain anonymous.  Most people don't
       know what that means.  It means the story is pure fiction.  They
       were printing things that no one could know except the people who
       were in the kid's hospital room while he was being questioned.  FBI
       and other law enforcement would be breaking the law if they leaked
       that kind of information.
       Because the AP sells its stories for syndication, websites like
       HuffingtonPost and other news aggregators, distribute this garbage
       as if it was real news.  Some people think HP is a liberal news
       source, and it doesn't matter that it isn't liberal, news, or a
       source, the damage is done.  Insidious lies saturate the public
       through this route.  It's as bad as Fox.

   bandied about press rooms across the land.

   Welcome to the deep-end of the pool, AP.  The water here is, well, kind
   of chilly.

   a love of one's country deep enough to call her to a higher plain."

 Exactly! ([1694]0+ / 0-)
       I would be very upset about this if the "official media" was the
       lofty, independent, non-partisan "voice of the people" that it
       pretends to be but isn't.  The media is a "for profit" industry and
       the master they serve is money, not the masses.

 Are we forgetting the other side of the story? ([1698]0+ / 0-)

   One of the things missing in all this outrage over DOJ spying on AP is
   what the story was that led to the inquiry.

   A terrorist attack was stopped by an Al Qeada insider in Yemen. The man
   was a convert to Islam born in I believe Finland. The story from AP
   threatened his life and that of his family. This valuable
   anti-terrorism asset was negated all in the interest of getting out a
   story.

   DOJ wanted to know who leaked the information that did that. I don't
   have a whole lot of sympathy for all the hand wringing.

   Steve King (R-NY) also shares much blame for opening his big mouth.
   That does not justify the damage done by AP. It just points out the
   stupidity of Repugnuts putting an idiot like King in a position where
   he receives classified information.

   The question that needs to be asked is about the arrogance of AP to
   have reported the story.

   Let the flames begin.

       because some guy, who you can't even be bothered to google any
       details about, might theoretically be in trouble.
       "the AP learned about the CIA's foiling of the plot the week before
       the Obama administration was going to announce it publicly. It
       ended up publishing the story a day before the Obama administration
       announced it publicly

       who are going to be put on the no-fly list because some computer
       somewhere decided they were a "threat" (using genetic algorithms
       that nobody has any idea how they work) after all those phone
       records were added to all the usual databases?  Or the reporters
       who will end up being threatened with blackmail because someone in
       the DOJ/FBI wants to control how things are reported?

 You're laughable- the AP held off on publishing ([1712]0+ / 0-)
       tbe story AT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST !!!
       IOW, the AP exercised its own prior restraint, not that that
       prevented the government from shitting all over the First and
       Fourth amendments (based on what we already know).

 Just a question for the author ([1731]0+ / 0-)

   Is the press above the law?

   Can they break the laws --the ones on the book-- and not be held
   accountable under the first amendment?

   The below is speculation on my part.  No need to answer these but I
   would like my original question answered above.  If you so choose to
   answer it.

   1.  How do we know the AP didn't hack into someone's phone records or
   computer to get the story?

   2.  How do we know there is NOT a stooge inside governmetn selling
   secrets to the highest bidder?

   3.   If America cracked the N. Korean code for missile launches, should
   that info be leaked to the AP and it be deemed freedom of the press?

   4.  Who decides what should be kept secret?  The AP or the Government?

   5.  How broad is broad?  20 phones out of thousands doesn't seem all
   that broad to me.

   6.  Shouldn't the media recuse itself until the investigation into the
   MEDIA is complete?
