   programming was the spark that started my professional life and
   impressed the teenage beauty who, 40 years later, is still the love of
   my life!"
   Randi Weingarten
   President, American Federation of Teachers
   "Computers have and continue to change the world around us, and
   programmers continue to be essential. But I know first hand from
   studying FORTRAN that many of us get intimidated by it and we shouldn't
   be. Computer programming has become far more accessible to teach and
   learn, and our country needs more students to learn it."
   Eric Cantor
   U.S. House Majority Leader

   know how to code. But we're only teaching it in a small handful of
   schools, why?"
   Tim O'Reilly
   Founder, O'Reilly Media
   "Programming is how we talk to the machines that are increasingly woven
   into our lives. If you aren't a programmer, you're like one of the

   "One hundred years ago, people were faced with the choice of learning
   to read or remaining illiterate laborers who would be left behind as
   have-nots in a rapidly modernizing world. In the coming century, being
   able to command a world that will be thoroughly computerized will set
   apart those who can live successfully in the future from those who will
   be utterly left behind."
   Rob Glaser
   Founder, RealNetworks
   "Learning how to code and program computers when I was a kid was one of
   the best choices I made growing up. By writing code, I learned how to
   bring my dreams to life, how to budget, and how to build stuff.

   the exposure and opportunity."
   Douglas Rushkoff
   Author, Program or Be Programmed
   "In the emerging, highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either
   create the software or you will be the software. It's really that
   simple: Program, or be programmed. Choose the former, and you gain
   access to the control panel of civilization. Choose the latter, and it
   could be the last real choice you get to make."
   Jason Hirschorn
   Former Chief Digital Officer, MTV, and President, Sling Media
   "Learning to code, just a little, helped me immensely in my career. I
   can converse and create with the rising leaders of the next generation,
   the coders themselves. Computers touch almost every aspect of our
