Prisons, army, mosque targeted in Iraq; nearly 50 dead

   By Mohammed Tawfeeq and Joe Sterling, CNN
   updated 11:18 AM EDT, Tue July 23, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Hundreds of prisoners escape, lawmaker says
     * At least 29 guards and inmates die in prison-break attempts
     * Sectarian and political violence in Iraq has erupted in recent
       months
     * Bombers rock Mosul, leaving 20 dead

   (CNN) -- Violence exploded in Iraq over the past 24 hours near Baghdad
   and in Mosul, leaving nearly 50 people dead and hundreds of al
   Qaeda-linked militants free in a massive jailbreak, authorities said
   Monday.

   Security forces battled militants outside two major penitentiaries near
   the Iraqi capital of Baghdad and thwarted prison breaks, the Justice
   Ministry said Monday. The incidents occurred Sunday night at Abu
   Ghraib, west of Baghdad, and al-Taji prison, north of the capital.

   The Justice Ministry said well-armed "terrorist groups" attacked the
   prisons simultaneously using mortars. They also carried
   rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, and were accompanied by
   suicide bombers and car bombs, the ministry said.

   The attacks coincided with riots by inmates who set fires inside the
   prisons, the ministry said. At least 21 inmates and at least eight
   prison guards were killed, it said, while 25 inmates and 14 guards were
   wounded.

   More than 500 inmates escaped from the two jails Sunday night, lawmaker
   Hakim al-Zamili said Monday. Most were from al Qaeda in Iraq, and some
   were senior members of the group.

   The ministry did not announce the number of escapees, but it said it
   has formed committees to count the number of inmates in each prison and
   will announce the number.

   [42]Bombers trike in Iraq; more than 20 dead

   Two attacks on Monday rocked Mosul, the northern Iraq metropolis. A
   suicide bomber blew himself up at an Iraqi army post in the Kokjili
   district in northern Mosul in the morning, police said. At least 16
   people were killed and 21 were wounded. Both civilians and soldiers
   were among the victims.

   Later, at least four people were killed and two were wounded when a
   roadside bomb exploded near a Sunni mosque in the al-Muthana
   neighborhood of central Mosul, police said.

   The deadly fighting is the latest in a string of violence in recent
   months, much of it stemming from discord between Sunnis and Shiites.
   Sunnis have long felt politically marginalized under a Shiite-led
   government in the post-Saddam Hussein era. They enjoyed more political
   clout during Hussein's rule, before his ouster after the U.S.-led 2003
   invasion.
