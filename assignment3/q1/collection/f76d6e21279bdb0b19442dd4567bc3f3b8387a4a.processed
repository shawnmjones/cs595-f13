   Against Illegal Guns, marking the one-year anniversary of the Aurora
   theater shootings, in Aurora, Colorado July 19, 2013.
   &nbsp;REUTERS/Rick Wilking
   Let's beat this asshat.
   In Colorado State Sen. Angela Giron's local [30]wingnut rag:

     First, we actually agree with [County Commissioner] Sal Pace when he
     said "This recall will create a wave of fear."

     A wave of fear is exactly what we want.

     We want our legislators to be afraid that if they ignore their
     constituents and instead listen to East Coast money, they will lose
     their jobs.

   [31]Goal Thermometer This is exactly what the NRA and its allies are
   gunning for--the continuation of a decades-long stranglehold on the
   issue of gun safety and regulation. We've seen that the NRA's ability
   to shuffle money [32]is limited. They've long relied on the perception
   of power, the sowing of fear that they can kick someone out of office.

   Less than 1 percent of their 2012 spending went to winning NRA-backed
   candidates. They've already been on the losing side of the IL-02
   primary earlier this year. Yet despite crazy overwhelming (and
   bipartisan) public support for expanded background checks, the US
   Congress refused to pass even a weak-tea expansion of such checks
   because of strong NRA lobbying efforts. In short, too many members of
   Congress were afraid of what the NRA might deliver during their next
   elections.

   This is what Colorado is all about--the NRA re-imposing its will on an
   issue in which it is slowly losing control. Its backers aren't
   shy--they want that "wave of fear". They desperately need it. It's the
   only thing that gives them leverage on an issue in which they long ago
   lost the public or moral high ground.

   So we're a week out. If you're frustrated at NRA obstruction of
   sensible gun regulations, then [33]donate to the recall targets. If
   you're eager to see the NRA knocked down a peg, then [34]donate to the
   recall targets. If you are loathe to see the NRA win because of
   electoral hijinks (late-summer low-turnout election without the
   vote-by-mail system used by a majority of Colorado voters in 2012),
   then [35]donate to the recall targets.

   The NRA is facing an existential threat. They've lost the public, there
   are two well-funded groups dumping real money on the other side
   (Bloomberg and Giffords), and they are losing elections they once
   dominated. They desperately need wins next week.

   There are good people fighting the good fight in Colorado. It's our
   jobs to have their backs. [36]Donate $3 to the two recall targets. Over
   11,000 of you have already chipped in. No more procrastination for the
   rest of us.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [61]Civil
   Rights, [62]Community, [63]Congress, [64]Culture, [65]Economy,
   [66]Education, [67]Elections, [68]Energy, [69]Environment, [70]Health
   Care, [71]International, [72]Labor, [73]Law, [74]Media, [75]Meta,
   [76]National Security, [77]Science, [78]Transportation, or [79]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([80]California, [81]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       It's not grounded in polls, but that's just the few comments I've
       heard from up here in Denver.  No room to relax.
       On another point, [170]the state has told the district in Pueblo
       that the state will not reimburse the district for the cost of the
       recall, about $300,000.    Even funnier is the Republican who
       organized the recall continues to insist that the state will pay to
       reimburse.  Meanwhile, El Paso county, which has Senator Morse's
       district as part of it, is also getting the bill, even though not
       every part of the county is in his district.  I'd be livid if I had
       to pay for a recall and I didn't even get to vote in it, but that's
       the Republican way - get someone else to pay for your tantrums.
       I wonder if people would have chosen against the recall if they'd
       known they'd have to pay the bill themselves.  It'd be nice if they
       could somehow make the Republicans or the recall backers have to
       pay, but I guess that's as likely as having those who signed for
       the recall be the ones responsible.

       From what I understand most of CO strongly disagrees with having
       the recalls, by something close to a 2 to 1 margin. I think the
       numbers a bit thinner then that in the areas voting in the recall
       though.
       I live nowhere near CO though, so I could easily be wrong about
       this.

       control of gun sales.  About 1/2 a dozen northeastern counties have
       ballot measures asking to withdraw from Colorado and form a new
       state based on anger against the legislation.  As well as
       restrictions on fracking.  Fat chance.  But it gives you an idea of
       the push back.  The two folks up for recall are in mixed districts,
       from what I know, and could lose.  Needless to say, I hope not.
       The ripples from successful recall of either or both would be felt
       across the country, IMHO.

       There were a lot of more pressing issues the legislature could have
       taken up this session than an unenforceable magazine capacity

 ***POLLING DATA*** ([205]6+ / 0-)

   At the request of several commenters, here's a
   [212]link to a recent Quinnipiac poll of the entire state of Colorado
   on the recall itself, the candidates, gun control issues, and at the
   bottom, marijuana legalization.

   In summary, the state (not merely the affected state senate districts)
   opposes the recall elections themselves by around a 3 to 1 margin.

   While the majority oppose stricter gun control measures (remember, this
   is the whole state, including very red rural areas, not merely the two
   blue senate districts in question), most support universal background
   checks (one of the measures the two Democrats voted for) by 3 to 1
   including Republicans. Gun magazine size restrictions are opposed 2 to
   1.

   In other words, the state is mixed on gun control, depending on the
   statute in question.

   This directly contradicts the narrative the recall supporters are
   pushing that the two state senators "voted against the will of their
   constituents".

   The gun nuts, including the local FOXNews wannabe newspaper, repeat
   this mantra over and over at every opportunity, as if the loudest
   shriekers of the right were the senator's only constituents. Right wing
   narcissism at its finest.

   The state is clear however, in their opposition to both recalls. Only a
   majority of Republicans support the recalls, I's and D's do not. A
   clear majority also believes that the issue should be settled during
   regular elections, not via recall election.

   This is the identical problem WI had in attempting to recall Walker
   over his union-busting efforts. Even though the state constitutions do
   not specify this, voters seem to believe that recall elections should
   only be called in cases of gross misconduct or illegal actions, not
   merely on political policy disagreements.

   Scroll down at the Quinnipiac page to see the precise poll data. Also
   note, at the very bottom, interesting questions about legalizing
   marijuana.

       When people oppose magazine restrictions 2 to 1 and representatives
       vote for those restrictions they "voted against the will of their
       constituents".
       Calling people gun nuts and Fox news wana bees harms rather than
       helps.
       Look. Our Dem legislature made a big mistake. They should first
       admit it, then suggest a fix, and move on to more important
       matters. I'm a lot less concerned about recall than I am the
       general election.

 What part of "mixed" don't you understand? ([224]2+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [225]43north, [226]coquiero

     In other words, the state is mixed on gun control, depending on the
     statute in question.
       Let me restate what I stated already. The Quinnipiac poll was
       statewide, meaning it included a bunch of red areas, and thus
       cannot be seen as accurately representing the opinions of the two
       blue senate districts in question. The two state senators represent
       blue districts, one of them, very blue.
       Even statewide, support or opposition depends on the specific
       statute in question, not the whole package of statutes. Democrats
       tend to support all of them, Republicans support some of them.
       Thus, opinions are mixed, even statewide. That in itself,
       invalidates the "against the will of their constituents" trope.
       Further, the individuals who keep making the questionable assertion
       that the senators "did not vote the will of their constituents"
       have not presented any polling data whatsoever, from either of
       these two districts, to support that assertion.
       Loud != Majority
       Thus, the only accurate poll we're going to get will be the final
       vote count on the 11th.
       The Pueblo Chieftain is clearly a FOXNews wannabe outlet. I've
       spoken to the Editor, and it was like Thanksgiving with Uncle
       Cleetis the O'Reilly fan. And I was calling to pass him a
       suggestion that he had asked for. I've received a hateful letter,
       from the owner of the paper, mocking me because the Republicans are
       going to do away with Social Security and Medicare, and then I'll
       get what I deserve for not saving for retirement the way he did.
       Bear in mind that I'm a veteran who is an expert shot with both the
       M16 and various handguns. I sleep with a .38 next to my bed, which
       I hope to never ever use for anything but target practice. And I've
       shot a bunch of other stuff, with very good accuracy. I used to be
       an NRA member, but the NRA has become a toxic entity in American
       politics.
       There is a radical difference between "responsible gun owner" and
       "gun nut". The operative word there is "radical".
       Gun Nuts howl with rage at sensible control measures. And they use
       incredibly stupid and weak arguments to justify their rage.
       We see that here in this community as well.

 3rdOption, a question ([230]0+ / 0-)
       Why was the magazine restriction linked to the background check
       provision, by Colorado lawmakers?
       Answer from the east coast:  to get what you want, we're going to
       link what you oppose.
       Knowing you'll hold your nose, vote for it, and hope to revise the
       bill or file a lawsuit.
       We'll do all we can to oppose any change or lawsuit, as "Colorado
       leads the nation in what must be done!"  (a much repeated line,
       after adoption of the legislation)
       Often it's done by the opposition, with the idea of killing
       legislation.  "Outlaw contraceptive funding of clinics" in a
       "continuing resolution" would be an example.
       We then read about "Democrats vote to shut-down Government" - which
       is what most legislation is all about.
       Headlines.
       I agree with this comment above:

     voters seem to believe that recall elections should only be called
     in cases of gross misconduct or illegal actions, not merely on
     political policy disagreements.

 I don't think the Republican *lawmakers*... ([234]0+ / 0-)
       ...wanted the background check provision at all.
       That being said, I would suggest that the reasoning behind the
       magazine size limit is esoteric, and needs too much explaining in
       the face of "They're aftur are FREEDUMZ!!!" logic.
       So for it to be popular, it would need to be explained and sold to
       the voting public.
       The only rejoinder to its critics that is easy to get your head
       around is, "How many rounds do you need to kill a deer?".
       But that little bit of non sequitur mockery does not a convincing

   recall petition. [278]Link: Denver Post
   As you pointed out in an earlier diary, since the success of the recall
   petitions (the first 2 in Colorado's 137 year history) the NRA isn't
   even close to matching the funding of Bloomberg & Co.

   Colbert-Busch, outspent her opponent (who was abandoned by his own
   party) 4-1 was up by 9 points a mere 2 weeks before the election.
   Gun Control was at the forefront of the national debate & once the
   election was 'made national', C-B managed to lose eighteen points.

   As tempting as it may be to dehumanize those that don't think they
   should lose their liberties as a result of the acts of a murderer, as
   strictly a mirage created by a faceless organization (presented as, by
   turns, both powerful & powerless). That simply isn't the case.
   AWB & magazine bans do lose Democratic voters & gain nothing else.
   But why argue?
   2014 isn't that far away.

       The local branch of the gun lobby is still citing sources from
       June, but [311]kos updated us at the end of August.

     The NRA has been working behind the scenes in the Colorado recalls,
     doing its dirty work through surrogates and allies. But that has
     [312]now changed.

     The NRA's Institute for Legislative Action has spent $108,667,
     through its own front committee to unseat the two senators who
     supported gun-control measures last session.

     That's likely not the full extent of the NRA's spending in the race,
     but it does point to its dirty little secret: $108K is not a lot of
     money. Well, it's a lot of money, but in political terms, it's far
     less than the tens or hundreds of millions spent by other political
     action committees and super PACs. And it's certainly far less than
     suggested by the NRA's outsized level of influence in D.C. and state
     capitols.

       They were restricting the size of gun magazines (mostly due to the
       Aurora theater shooter having a gun magazine with 100 rounds) and
       requiring that everyone buying a gun even at gun shows and through
       non-firearm dealers have to clear a background check.  That's
       closing the gun show loophole - not taking liberties away.  If
       someone wasn't supposed to be allowed to purchase a gun from a
       dealer, why should they still have the liberty to purchase a gun
       from a gun show?
       We'll see with the recalls, but I'm happy that the restrictions are
       in place and no matter whether these two Senators are recalled or
       not, the Colorado legislature won't be passing bills to recall
       these restrictions because the House is much more Democratic and
       the governor is still a Democrat.  And if you think that's going to
       change in 2014, look at who the Republicans are running.  They're
       not able to appeal to their districts or the whole state the way
       the Democrats can.

       You seem to have trouble grasping the complexity of the situation.
        Do you think it's all or nothing?
       If the 2nd amendment is amended, which is very unlikely, to limit
       ownership or increase regulations, you will still be able to own a
       gun.  You will still have the right to keep and bear arms, just not
       maybe as much as before.
       Please, for the love of pete, show me where I have said I would
       like to repeal the second amendment.  I'm begging you.
       I belong to a group whose name you vomit out in every comment  as
       if it wins an argument for you.  I would like to see the 2nd
       amendment amended, not repealed.  Others in the group believe it
       should be repealed.
       Because you defend the NRA at every opportunity, does that mean you
       approve of everything they say?  I think not.
       So, stop this nonsense immediately.

   "Liberty--lib·er·ty  (lbr-t)n. pl. lib·er·ties
   1. a. The condition of being free from restriction or control.
        b. The right and power to act, believe, or express oneself in a

   2. Freedom from unjust or undue governmental control.
   3. A right or immunity to engage in certain actions without control or
   interference: the liberties protected by the Bill of Rights.

   That is the mag ban & AWB.

   "not taking liberties away"
   You want a background check?
   It would have happened if the Pres of the USA hadn't have
   simultaneously decided to propose a gun ban....A gun ban introduced to
   the Senate by someone who has said ""If I could have gotten 51 votes in
   the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every
   one of them . . . Mr. and Mrs. America, turn 'em all in, I would have
   done it."

   "We'll see with the recalls"
   We already have. These are the first.....and second successful recall

       where there are no restrictions or controls to people or actions.
       Nowhere in your definition is there a mention of responsibilities.
        This country wasn't founded to be an anarchy - there are covenants
       agreed to by the states on how people will act and be governed.
       With the liberties protected by the Bill of Rights come
       responsibilities enumerated by the Constitution.  This country has
       obligations for the health and safety - yes safety - of the
       citizens and if you want to live in a place where there are
       complete liberties and no responsibilities to others - well even
       Somalia appears to be trending away from that.  Go find yourself
       someplace else to call home, because if you are going to be a
       United States citizen, you have to accept the responsibilities of
       being that citizen including supporting and upholding the laws of

       and [594]it's a statewide poll, so not particular to the districts
       involved.  It's very tough to gauge this, as there will be only
       voting in person without absentee or mail-in ballots, due to a
       Constitutional provision requiring allowing names to be put on
       ballots up to just a week (or ten days, can't recall) before the
       election if they get enough signatures.
       In short, majorities aren't in favor of the recalls, but it will
       really depend upon GOTV and the gun lobby has a lot of enthusiasts.

       and this recall may change momentum, but right now I am more
       committed as a Democrat because Democrats are sticking up for kids,
       for trying to make the streets safer, for trying to restrict gun
       purchases by people who shouldn't be allowed to have them and for
       people who don't want to be threatened by nuts and wackos.
       If these recalls fail, and I'm hope they do, it may allow more Dems
       to come out in favor of gun regulations and take us out from under
       the intimidation of the NRA and RMGO's, as well as fear from guns
       being encountered in day-to-day life.  It may also cause more
       people to wonder about the messages spewed by the NRA and their ilk

       history points more to the extremism of the NRA and gun purists.
       They are willing to recall legislators who happened to support and
       pass sane gun laws?  That's not a Democratic problem.  That's a gun
       lobby problem.  They are the ones who brought us to this point.

 The fact is that this is the first TWO recalls in ([726]0+ / 0-)

       "history points"
       History is pointing. Namely to 1994.
       "sane gun laws"
       What is 'sane' about passing an unenforceable mag restriction that
       punishes the innocent?
       "They are the ones who brought us to this point"
       No. It's the gun controllers. Don't worry. The party is paying
       attention.
       See you in the aftermath of 2014.....
       Much as in the aftermath of 1994, I expect to not have to see you
       again.

       remain classic examples of NRA overreach and teabagger extremism.
       How in the world is passing middle of the road law that contains
       reasonable gun regulations grounds for a recall? This recall is
       nothing but the result of gun absolutists unhinged.
       One more thing: it's no longer 1994.  Times are changing fast.  In
       2004 Republicans successfully used anti-gay ballot measures to
       defeat Democrats.  In 2012 that no longer worked.  The same is
       happening with gun laws.  The NRA (and Republicans) are doomed by

 Another 1994 comparison is healthcare ([752]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   In 1994 Hillary Clinton was the most reviled public figure who had
   never run for elected office. Bill tapped the first lady, his wife, to
   take on healthcare reform. The country wasn't ready.

   If we based our support for Hillary Clinton based on what the country
   thought in 1994, we New Yorkers would never have elected her to be our
   Senator! Not once, but twice!. President Obama picked her to be
   Secretary of State, arguably the second most powerful position in the
   Executive branch of our government.

   And then there is healthcare reform, which Hillary spearheaded. I
   remember watching her testimony in those hearings. The country wasn't
   ready. Elected leaders weren't ready. Now hear we are.

   The "It's 1994" meme is long past it's "sell by" date.

       The lessons of 1994 is something to totally forget about.

       of gun control.

       over and over and over, without any factual support.
       The Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University
       has demonstrated through multiple data sources that common sense
       gun regulations do result in less gun violence.  And this is based
       on rigorous mathematical analysis, not the cherry picking that the
       NRA is famous for.  Prime evidence is the firearms suicide rate in
       Wyoming compared to that, say of NY or MD.  Gun violence per capita
       is higher in states that have looser gun regulations.  The Center
       for Gun Policy has posted their data and analytical methods for all
       to view, so if anyone wishes to disagree, they are free to do so by
       engaging in the scientific method and pointing out quantifiable

 Bill Clinton disagrees. He attributed 20 House ([769]0+ / 0-)

       How can you be so willfully blind?
       Chicago has a murder rate 3 times the national average. Washington

       1994.  So even by that logic, and Clinton has been wrong on many
       things (like DADT, DOMA, repeal of Glass Steagall) the NRA did not
       deliver the House to Republicans.
       Sorry, but as the Center for Gun Policy and Research has
       demonstrated, when you rigorously control for demographics and
       other such quantities it turns out that states with lax gun laws
       have the highest per capita rates of gun violence.  Furthermore,
       there is a whole other 95% of the planet outside of this country
       that strengthens that conclusion even more.

       Correct.
       They also haven't caused these recalls. The voters did.
       The NRA is simply a convenient boogeyman for gun controllers to
       blame when the turn the electorate against the Dem Party.

 Totally agree. On 8/29 Rachel Maddow ([789]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   discussed how a variety of gradual changes have been happening over the
   past 5 years:

   (a) number of uninsured went down
   (b) improvement in equality for LGBTs
   (c) fewer people incarcerated
   (d) marijuana restrictions easing

   Her point was that all of the above were absolutely inconceivable even
   as recently as 2004.  But look what happened.  I posit that the same
   will happen with respect to changing the gun culture in this country.
   We have already enacted sane gun laws in MD, CT, NY, and CO.  Sure, at
   this moment in time some states are doing the opposite, but then these
   same states are doing their best to restrict voter rights, and they are
   on the wrong side of history on both of these issues.

   Rachel did not explicitly mention it, but clearly much credit goes to
   President Obama.  And he has already done well on the gun front as
   well, issuing common sense executive orders to close whatever gun
   related loopholes he can.

   a confederate flag, he is not carrying a gun, and his sign is properly

       can tell how crazy an organization's members are by looking at

       full of fear, paranoia, and teh crazy.  And more to the point, what
       exactly is the sign holder going on about?  Colorado passed a

       grounds for a recall.

       On the current point of contention: Are the complaints just part of
       a negotiating strategy to extract concessions from the state of
       Colorado? I'm asking a sincere question.
       Talk is one thing. A lease, a contract, etc....is what I'm looking
       for. Anything concrete. Is there any proof that it's more than
       "planning", more than "intending", more than bluster, more than
       "We're pissed! We're leaving!!"
       I don't have my finger on the pulse. But you do. I'm asking you to
       make a convincing case, because the other side may have a hard time
       telling the difference between these companies and the Papa John's
       complaining about the ACA.
       Thank you for the reference. It's closer to what I am asking for.
       From a business/practical perspective I'm just skeptical that any
       business would bother with the expense, uncertainty, and business
       disruption to move their unit, or their entire company. unless they
       stand to profit from the overall strategy. Call me cynical, but
       it's possible that they will extract maximum profit by talking
       tough and then finding some other reason not to move.

     Erie-based Magpul Industries is the largest company packing its
     bags. The 200-employee business makes high-capacity magazines, which
     the Colorado Legislature voted to ban. In testimony before state
     lawmakers before the vote, Doug Smith, Magpul's chief operating
     officer, said the debate hurt the state's economy.

     "Our plans to expand our operations in Colorado to a larger
     build-to-suit facility are currently on hold," he said. "If HB 1224
     were to be enacted as law in the state, those plans for Colorado
     expansion would be canceled."
     'The Beginning Of The End'
     And they were. Today, Magpul can still legally manufacture
     high-capacity magazines in the state, but starting July 1, it can no
     longer sell them here. The company says it is leaving because it
     disagrees with the new gun laws on philosophical grounds.

       They do the majority of manufacturing in NH and AZ, not in the

       contract juju, made them non-competitive.
       Magpul can "energize the base" by moving.
       They may obtain local tax relief as is customary in many
       negotiations with a new location.
       I know Walmart backed-out of a proposed new store in NH, when the
       costs to the municipality were made known, including the 20-year
       100% tax-abatement.
       I'd bet certain areas of the mid-south, mid-west and west would
       view 200 jobs in a formerly vacant year 2000-era multi-use
       manufacturing/corporate/jet park as very attractive.
       Magpul may have competing offers, which would complicate moves by
       the company, without cooperation of the workforce.

 Several reasons, some obvious. ([1082]0+ / 0-)
       Most of the world is like us, when it comes to protectionism.
       Beretta won the US Military XM9 contract, not because their pistol
       was markedly superior to SIG, Glock, or HK.  They won, as they
       alone had a US Defense Department contractor (Maremont) already
       on-the-hook.
       A US firm, hoping to sell to the Czech Republic, would require a
       Czech partner.  With CZ/Brno already in-country?
       Not happening.  IMI already makes the Galil in Israel, the South
       Koreans make military arms too, as does the nation of
       [1083]Singapore.  All export product.
       We also export most of our "foreign sales" via the Dept of State
       and Dept of Defense.  "Military Aid".
       As to imports, there's four categories.
       1) Foreign-made guns of a foreign company.  Glock® as an example.
       2) Domestic-made guns of a foreign company.  Beretta® USA, SIG®
       Arms as an example.
       3) Foreign-made guns of a US company, either design partner or
       distributor.  Springfield® brand handguns, Browning® brand shotguns
       and rifles.
       4) Importation of a US-made firearm, sold-to, or given as aid at
       some time (decades ago) to a foreign power.
       WWII or Korean-era Springfield M1903, M1 Garand, or US M1 Carbines
       as an prime examples.

       My feeling for or against the recall is irrelevant. There is a
       legal process for recalls in Colorado, it was followed. I don't see
       you calling for a boycott of the recall because you do not like it.
       The recall is happening, you have taken a side. So did the other
       guy.
       So by any logical standard, you are exactly as much of an asshat as
       he is. Though unless you can find him calling you one, I think the
       scales look a little heavier on your side.
       If you do not like the process for initiating a recall, work to
       have it changed. But if a recall is happening, it is hypocritical
       to take a side and then insult someone else for doing the same.

       also not calling for recall elections, unless there's info about
       the photo that you didn't share.  He's just expressing his opinion

       than what the fellow in the diary photo is encouraging.

       I think it makes the point that people hold placards supporting
       their view in a recall, and that does not automatically make them
       "asshats".
       And as I said in a previous comment, Markos ceded the moral high
       ground on rhetoric by using violence-tinged imagery three times in
       his opening paragraph. So calling the guy an asshat solely for
       "stand your ground" is pretty weak sauce.
       Recall Walker with "encouraging violence" or other violence-related
       terms from the first few pages of a search that had thousands of
       results:
       [1145]Clenched fist in the air

       [1147]Join the rebellion
       [1148]And oh my goodness, a boot kicking him. Fetch the fainting
       couch.
       Do I actually think these people were encouraging the violence of
       punching or kicking Scott Walker, or open rebellion against the
       government? Of course not. You'd have to be a real asshat to
       automatically assume something like that of a total stranger.

       smears and parodies.
       The rule of transfusion: manipulating the consensus values of the
       target audience for one's own ends.
       The rule of unanimity: presenting one's viewpoint as if it were the
       unanimous opinion of all right-thinking people: draining the
       doubting individual into agreement by the appeal of
       star-performers, by social pressure, and by 'psychological

       The rule of orchestration: endlessly repeating the same messages in

       If I saw a new group here purportedly about women's reproductive
       freedoms and laws affecting them, but it turned out many of its
       members were also loudmouthed Operation Rescue trolls, and few or
       none of the pro-choice members of DKos were in the group, I'd be a
       mite suspicious.
       And then if an admin for that group posted a guideline to
       reproductive law linking to an anti-choice site, with states
       pre-graded with big elementary-school grade letters so people
       wouldn't have to go through that whole "critical thought" process
       to decide for themselves (especially when there is a strictly
       fact-based, well-linked Wikipedia page on the subject), I'd have
       serious doubts about the reality of that group's stated purpose.
       I'd wonder whether they had any principles at all, much less
       liberal ones, or maybe be more charitable and think the group was a
       good idea, but it just got hijacked by extremists and ruined beyond
       any hope of credibility.
       I would be inclined to think that if someone's belief is so weak
       that it cannot withstand scrutiny, actively discourages one set of
       viewpoints, and works to pre-judge an issue before giving anyone a
       chance to see the facts for themselves, there would definitely be
       aspects of propaganda going on there.
       That's what I'd think, if I ran across a Daily Kos group like that.
       But there is no need to write a diary about it when a pithy comment
       will do the job.

   Making about any of us is disingenuous and baiting.

   I don't agree with the wave of "gun control laws" that have passed,
   especially in my own State of New York.  I want better Democrats that
   trust We The People not the authoritarians that we currently have that
   believe government by decree is legitimate.

   But many of us have warned about repeating these same mistakes.  We
   were mocked and belittled.  Here we are at that precipice once again.
   Republicans do more harm but one issue voters don't care and won't

   We could have done so many things to lower violence (including gun
   violence) in our society but didn't.  We are now faced with the
   consequences of those foolish decisions.

       "The people of Colorado" are voting starting tomorrow on whether to
       recall the Senators.  All that has happened so far is that the
       recall petitioners have gathered (or created) enough signatures to
       get these recall elections to happen.  It remains to be see if the
       people in these two districts actually want to recall these

       and more specifically of those districts have petitioned to remove

       Aren't you splitting hairs here and ignoring the truth, we vote for

       saying: "All Politics Are Local".
       Should we be swayed by "what all the people" in Colorado want or
       believe, they don't have a say. do they?  Correction, they have as
       much right to recall or vote out of office their representatives in
       their districts, correct?
       Argument by popularity doesn't work for me, it's akin to "group

       people of Colorado want, says that the people of Colorado do NOT
       want these Senators recalled.  That's where you're wrong.  In your
       reply to me you then say more specifically these districts, which
       is really the only thing that matters and it doesn't take a
       majority to get a recall election conducted - just a portion of the
       voters, so we don't know what the majority of voters of these
       districts want (unless you know of some poll or some pre-vote that
       none of the rest of us know about).  Until the election results are
       in, we do NOT know what the voters of these districts will do and
       in any case, your first statement seeming to classify everyone in
       Colorado as wanting these Senators removed is just wrong and
       unsupportable.
       I have said nothing against having the ability to recall the
       Senators.  I'm just pointing out that you're wrong when you state -
       too general or not - that "the people of Colorado want them
       recalled" as that's the opposite of the only measure of the people
       of Colorado's opinion - the Quinippiac poll.

       in generalities, yes.
       And you are correct, we won't know what the results will be until
       the election.
       The propaganda of "the polls" means nothing.  You should know this,
       they can be manipulated to say whatever anyone wants.  The very
       fact that they did a poll to ask "the majority" shows that they are
       afraid of losing and are attempting to use that poll as a means to
       keep the riff-raff silent and deny them the right to vote for
       whomever they wish. Like it's some moral faux pas saying: "You
       dared to recall us, why I never!"
       The poll is manipulation of the people of Colorado to stop them
       from exercising their rights.
       If the entire State of Colorado didn't want a few people to have
       the power to recall a representative, then why'd they agree to it?
        And since you seem to know a bit more than me here. How many
       people signed the recall petitions?  How many does it take?  A
       specific number or a percentage of the voters?
       Nevermind, that's splitting hairs as well, there were enough
       signatures and petitions submitted to recall these representatives.
        What prompted the people to do so?

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   To advocate effectively for repeal or passage of firearms legislation
   we must first know and understand current law and policy, and how both
   are implemented, where we live. There is enormous variability across
   the country; the relative utility/relative risk of firearms is
   different on a 500 acre ranch in Montana than for a 1000 square foot
   apartment in New York. State and local laws reflect that diversity. We
   will discuss firearms law and policy with an emphasis on the many
   historical ethics and ideals of Western Civilization, as opposed to
   what are currently known as "Libertarian" ideals.

   This group is also a study group; a place to learn and discuss which
   gun regulations are constitutional restrictions in this post-Heller
   environment. (A law degree is not required). With Congressional
   gridlock likely to impede any useful national legislation, progress
   will have to be made at the state and local level.
