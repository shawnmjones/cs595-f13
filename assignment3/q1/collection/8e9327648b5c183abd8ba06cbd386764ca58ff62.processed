NSA misrepresented scope of data collection to secret court

   By Evan Perez, CNN Justice Reporter
   updated 8:05 AM EDT, Thu August 22, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Obama administration declassified secret court opinions showing
       broad collection of Internet data
     * Opinions showed that the NSA was misrepresenting its effort to the
       special anti-terror court
     * NSA surveillance programs brought to public light by Edward Snowden
       leaks
     * NEW: Intelligence official says problem was technological; was not
       a case of "overeager" spying

   Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration on Wednesday declassified
   opinions from a secret court that oversees government surveillance
   showing the National Security Agency was broadly collecting domestic
   Internet communications of Americans and misrepresenting the scope of
   that effort to the court.

   The three opinions include one from October 2011 by U.S. District Judge
   John Bates, who scolded government lawyers that the NSA had, for the
   third time in less than three years, belatedly acknowledged it was
   collecting more data than it was legally allowed to.

   "NSA acquires valuable information through its upstream collection, but
   not without substantial intrusions on Fourth Amendment protected
   interests," Bates wrote.

   The focus of the opinion was the government's admission that for three
   years, under its authority to monitor foreign communications, it had
   been collecting information beyond what it gets from Internet service
   providers, and included data that was entirely domestic.

   The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court estimated the mistaken
   collection of domestic data, including e-mails and other Internet
   activity of Americans, totaled 58,000 communications a year.

   The NSA said the collection was a mistake that went beyond its
   authority under Section 702 of the Patriot Act.

   "This was a situation where there was technological problem that could
   not be avoided, rather than any overreach" by the NSA, according to a
   senior intelligence official who spoke with reporters about the matter.

   The other FISA Court opinions from November 2011 and September 2012
   covered NSA steps to fix errors it made in over-collecting data and to
   purge data it shouldn't have collected. Those rulings indicated that
   the matter had been resolved.

   The overall issue, the intelligence official said, was immediately
   raised with the court.

   "The FISA court probed deeply and thoroughly into the issue. The
   government took strong appropriate steps to remedy the problem, and the
   court determined it had remedied and that the collection could
   continue," according to the official who did not speak for attribution.

   "This is not an egregious overreaching by a greedy agency seeking to
   spy on Americans," the official added.

   privacy rules

   The administration also released documents provided to Congress to
   persuade lawmakers to reauthorize its surveillance authorities.

   The agency has come under pressure from lawmakers of both parties over
   the sweeping nature of its secret data collection, most recently
   surveillance that captures telephone metadata related to communications
   to and from the United States.

   That program and the one addressed in the document release on Wednesday
   were brought to public light through leaks to media outlets by former
   NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who fled the United States and is now in
   Russia under temporary asylum. He faces espionage charges.

   Their exposure also has generated concern from privacy groups and
   libertarians.

   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, who has proposed
   legislation aimed at reforming certain provisions of the Patriot Act
   related to the FISA Court, welcomed the newest development.

   "Today's release of documents by the Director of National Intelligence
   begins to appropriately draw back the curtain on the secret law of
   government surveillance, and they also underscore the need for
   increased oversight and stronger protections for Americans' privacy,"
   he said in a statement.

   Leahy is planning a hearing in coming weeks on the document release.

   In 2008, the NSA began collecting what it called "upstream"
   communications, essentially information that travels across the
   Internet, separate from the what it receives from Internet service
   providers that filter data to respond to agency requests.

   The NSA is supposed to be targeting foreign communications, such as
   e-mail addresses it believes relate to foreign intelligence, that have
   to do with potential terrorism investigations.

   The NSA said it made mistakes because of the way data was collected. It
   couldn't separate information that was entirely domestic.

   Government lawyers won approval from the court after making changes and
   later deleted years of data because some of it couldn't be separated
   from domestic communications.
