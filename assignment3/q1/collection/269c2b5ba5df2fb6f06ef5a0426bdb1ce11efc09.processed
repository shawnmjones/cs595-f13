Microsoft Research: How fighting email spam is helping the search for an HIV
vaccine

   Helping tackle some of the most urgent global challenges is firmly on
   the agenda for Microsoft Research (MSR) - applying our experience, our
   depth and breadth of expertise, our partnerships and the power of
   software to tackle these challenges. In the case of searching for a
   vaccine for HIV, all of this comes in to play as we're applying
   high-powered computation, fighting HIV with data and perhaps
   surprisingly, using our experience of building email spam filters to
   find a solution.

   More than 1.8 million people die of HIV-related causes each year --
   approximately 5,000 deaths per day. One of the great challenges in
   fighting HIV is that the virus is constantly mutating to avoid attack
   by the immune system -- so much so that it can change as much within
   one infected person as the influenza virus has throughout recorded
   history. This makes it incredibly difficult to accurately analyze the
   virus and develop therapies that attack its elusive weak points. Each
   mutation means another variable to identify and understand. To
   complicate things even more, individual immune response varies greatly;
   some people's immune systems are able to robustly combat the virus,
   allowing them to live for years without treatment, while others become
   sick more quickly as their bodies fail to resist the invasive attack.

   As with many MSR projects, this work is being undertaken in partnership
   with several other experts in the field. Testing of a vaccine in
   Durban, South Africa is being led by Bruce Walker, at the [51]Ragon
   Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT and Harvard, and a
   professor of medicine at the [52]University of KwaZulu-Natal. They are
   joined by the [53]Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South
   Africa and the [54]KwaZulu-Natal Research Institute for Tuberculosis
   and HIV. This testing program generates vast quantities of data, the
   analysis of which presents a huge hurdle.

   That's where [55]David Heckerman and Jonathan Carlson of Microsoft
   Research along with a [56]Microsoft Computational Biology Tool called
   PhyloD come in. This software enables efficient data mining which then
   leads to specific cell analysis that helps detail virus patterns for
   further analysis. PhyloD contains an algorithm, code and visualization
   tools to perform complex pattern recognition and analysis - enabling
   Heckerman and his colleagues to learn how different individual immune
   systems respond to the many mutations of the virus.



   Ordinarily the computing power required to process the number of
   variables and possible correlations would take years, but combining the
   PhyloD tool with Microsoft's high-performance computing center, this
   work can be done in hours. Working with two groups, one led by
   Christian Brander in Barcelona, and another led by Paul Goepfert at the
   University of Alabama, Heckerman and his team have discovered roughly
   six times as many possible attack points on the HIV virus as had been
   previously identified.

     "When we first met Bruce, he had a very tricky problem to analyze,"
     remembers David Heckerman. "He had this great data set but he didn't
     know how to analyze it. We happened to have just the right algorithm
     for it and this large bank of computers at Microsoft that could do
     this massive amount of computation. He gave us the problem on
     Friday. On Monday, we had a completed analysis for him."

   What I personally find most fascinating about this work is that it
   builds on previous work Heckerman undertook to build an email spam
   filter. The same principles that are being used to fight spam in
   Hotmail, Outlook and Exchange are being used to tackle HIV. It turns
   out there are a lot of similarities between the way spammers evolve
   their approaches to avoid filters and the way that the HIV virus is
   constantly mutating.

   As much as I love the day to day excitement of our industry with new
   devices and new software announced on a weekly basis, it's work such as
   this that I find truly inspiring. As Bruce Walker notes,

     "everything we learn here is going to be applicable not just to HIV
     but to breast cancer and prostate cancer--and will ultimately change
     the way medicine is practiced"

   I love the pace and excitement of our industry and Microsoft's part in
   that - but it's also rewarding to know that I work for a company that
   is applying our brains and technology to global challenges like these
   and seeking to truly change the world with the power of software.

       My understanding of this is that the virus alters its genetic data,
       just as a spammer alters the contents of the emails it sends.

       no the spammers change how they make it past filters and spam
       blockers not just the contents.

       Super computer can alone solve HIV vaccine ?
       Is it an fact now or in experiment stage ?
       Viral behavior is so eccentric that it presents both lifeless and
       living state.
       Textbooks must be reviewed !
