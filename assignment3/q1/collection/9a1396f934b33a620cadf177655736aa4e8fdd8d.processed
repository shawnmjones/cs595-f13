[22]Marriage equality: What do we do after we win?

   Two men at the U.S. Capitol with t-shirts reading
   Soon, this fight will be over. What will be next?
   This past week, the Supreme Court hosted oral arguments in two separate
   but ultimately related cases, each of which will have significant
   ramifications on whether my LGBT friends will have the same right as I
   do to marry the person they love and just what rights they'll end up
   with if they do. On Tuesday, the justices [29]heard the appeal filed by
   anti-equality activists to the Circuit Court decision in Hollingsworth
   v. Perry--a decision which found that California's Proposition 8,
   passed by voters in 2008 to outlaws same-sex marriage, violated
   California's constitution. The very next day, the court [30]heard
   United States v. Windsor in order to decide whether the decision of the
   Second Circuit Court of Appeals to invalidate Section 3 of the Defense
   of Marriage Act was the correct one.

   It is widely anticipated that Justice Kennedy could be the swing vote
   on one or both cases, and court observers [31]are wondering whether the
   justices will even rule on the merits of the cases at all, or whether
   they will simply decide that the respective appellants had no standing
   to have the case heard at all and dismiss them as improvidently
   granted. While it would certainly be optimal from the point of view of
   any subsequent court cases if the justices were to rule favorably on
   the merits of each case, a dismissal on issues of standing would
   certainly be a positive, as rights currently forbidden under DOMA would
   be eligible to be granted to legally married couples and same-sex
   marriages could resume in California after a what would approach a
   five-year hiatus.

   [32]SCOTUSBlog, a widely respected commentator on these matters, opines
   that DOMA will be struck down and that Justice Kennedy [33]appeared
   favorable to the idea of dismissing the appeal in Hollingsworth on
   procedural issues, which would avoid a conversation on the merits of
   matter at hand. The American people, however, are [34]increasingly
   ready for that conversation, even if the anti-equality Republican Party
   is not. Nate Silver has analyzed the evolution of national and state
   polling on views toward marriage equality and [35]has noted that if
   support for marriage equality continues to increase at its current
   pace, that by 2020 there will be majority support all but six states by
   2020, with the last holdouts unsurprisingly being [36]the deep South.

   Presuming that the Supreme Court does not take the unanticipated step
   of finding a right to marriage equality in the Constitution in either
   of these cases, polling indicates that the momentum generated by
   polling trends and the 2012 sweep of related ballot initiatives will
   lead to victories in more states over the next few years, and
   eventually, a Supreme Court with more deference to the opinion of
   mankind will determine that equality is inherent in the Constitution
   and end the resistance of whatever states have not passed equality on
   their own. The big question is, what happens then?

   Despite [37]spending millions to defend DOMA before the Supreme
   Court--the "United States" in the case title is not represented by the
   Department of Justice, but rather by the House Office of General
   Counsel--Republicans simply don't want to talk about their opposition
   to equality any more because they know that times have changed since
   2004. Republicans face a huge dilemma as a party: Will they drop their
   opposition to equality and risk losing the enthusiasm of the theocratic
   wing of their base, or do they maintain their anti-gay positions while
   simply hoping the discussion simply doesn't come up?

   The possibility of a plutocrat-versus-theocrat split is a significant
   risk for the Republican Party, true; but there is danger for Democrats
   as well. The LGBT equality movement is often compared to the racial
   civil rights movement, and in many respects the comparison is accurate.
   There is, however, one key difference. All Americans are entitled to
   equality under the law, regardless of race; but as Lee Atwater
   [38]infamously explained, conservative economic policy is at its heart
   a continuation of the so-called "Southern Strategy" which seeks to
   conserve the systemic economic barriers that prevent minorities from
   actually achieving the equality to which they are entitled. And while
   religious arguments were [39]certainly used to defend racial
   inequality, theocracy forms the centerpiece of the opposition to LGBT
   equality:There are no economic tie-is to tax policy, makers and takers,
   welfare, or other conservative economic hot buttons.

   Consequently, as LGBT equality strengthens its current status as a
   mainstream view, especially among the younger voters who will dictate
   the social thought of the future, it will become much easier for
   Republicans to cast aside the theocratic dead-enders and work to
   eliminate a key issue of contrast that causes voters of all stripes to
   lean toward the Democratic Party. This moment may be years or decades
   off, and there will certainly be residual effects among the electorate
   for many more years after that. But eventually, the Democratic Party
   will need to aggressively seek areas of contrast to lure younger
   voters, instead of having contrast handed to it on a silver platter by
   theocratic Republican bigotry. The Republican war on reproductive
   rights seems to be continuing unabated, which will continue to provide
   an unfortunate opportunity; but eventually, Democrats will need to
   provide a much stronger contrast on making sure young people believe
   that we have an economy that works for us. Republicans are working for
   exactly the opposite, and that contrast won't go away any time soon.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   5. Obviously - Sexual preference equality in hiring.

   6. Obviously - Sexual identity equality in hiring.

   7. Obviously - sick days, personal days for birthing and caring for

       This is a mistake liberals have made for a long time. We achieve
       some legislation or legal ruling and think, "Phew! Glad that's
       over!" While the right sits and stews in their defeat, licks their
       wounds, and plots ways to undo the progress. Just because DOMA
       falls or marriage equality is recognized in all 50 states (and
       assorted territories and DC) doesn't mean "it's over". In a sense
       the defense of it has just begun.
       You can't assassinate the character of any of modern conservative.
       You'd have to find where it was buried, dig it up, resurrect it,
       then kill it. And killing a zombie isn't really assassination, is
       it?

   To take the laws that have successfully passed in various states and
   push them to be taken up in the other states.  It's simply nonsensical
   that people can be fired or refused housing in so many states simply
   because of gender preferences.  But it should be a broader ALEC-like
   entity, and push all sorts of progressive legislation, so as to get as
   many stakeholders involved as possible.  Solidarity!

   Whatever the SCOTUS rules in June is still not full equality. Seems at
   BEST, there's at least ONE more SCOTUS case to be heard to declare
   marriage equality constitutional and any denial of such
   unconstitutional. Let's just get there first.

   Good lord, there's SO MUCH work to do yet. because even after SCOTUS

       The reason why ENDA is not federal law right now is largely because

   It's interesting that this is happening at the same time that some
   Republicans are apparently ready to make a deal on immigration short of
   "self-deportation".

   I think people are missing the forest because of all the trees. The
   overwhelmingly important fact in American politics toady is the huge
   support the Democrats enjoy among voters not just under 30, but under
   40. About 60% of all voters under 40 voted for Obama, and the younger
   you were, the more likely you were to do so. Yes, younger voters are
   more heavily Hispanic, but Hispanics are still less than a quarter of
   younger voters. The Republicans desperately need to halt and reverse
   the trend in which every 4 years there are 5,670,000 new Democratic
   voters and only 3,780,000 new Republicans.

   To halt that crippling process they would need to do everything
   possible to appeal to younger voters. Let's see what they come up with.

   on a state level to enact and defend oppressive legislation. It's up to

   Gun violence. Despite the progress that may well be made this session,
   there will be much more to be done. The constitutional militia-ists
   should not be driving the debate on "civilian-style" assault weapons,
   for example.

   Health care. The core problem is not the cost of Medicare or Medicaid
   and not Obamacare. It's the cost of health care services and the huge
   set of industries who defend their own profit steams and ways of doing
   business.

   These will allow plenty of "eventuallys" to continue showing up the

   I was asked that question once. After John Aravosis' "Stop Dr Laura"
   campaign succeeded, he solicited ideas for the next campaign. I humbly
   suggested that we turn to transgendered rights. Like the "right" to
   work and support ourselves, or the "right" to health care, fair,
   adequate housing, access to the same services most other Americans take
   for granted. I was quickly shot down however, in favor of pushing for
   marriage equality, (though he didn't call it that then). Eventually,
   Aravosis [452]revealed his true colors when he decided that
   transgendered Americans have no place in the gay civil rights movement.

    So how about now? Is it time yet for my right to exist among other
   people? Is it finally time to push for anti discrimination laws so I
   can be a full citizen? Or will the John Aravosis's decide once again
   that we just make gay and lesbian Americans look bad by being
   associated with us?

       the community to push anything, though I wish I had that power.
       But if you're looking for progressives to apologize for supporting

   Without the theocrats, the Republican Party only stands for massive
   transfers of wealth from the poor to the rich and starting wars all
   over the globe. Unless the US becomes gripped in another post-9/11
   style bout of fear that the GOP can exploit, that's not a winning
   platform. They can only win by moving to the left.

   Of course, GOP still has the abortion issue.

 It's not quite over yet, even if we win this one. ([517]0+ / 0-)

   People outside of progressive states like California are shocked and
   pained to learn that various kinds of discrimination against LGBTQ
   communities are not always treated the same as other kinds,
   particularly but not limited to employment discrimination - yes, unless
   your state has prohibited it, it may be legal for your boss to come to
   you and say, "I and/or my divinity of choice don't like
   gay/lesbian/bisexual people, so I'm firing you."  Granted, large
   companies have adopted non-discrimination policies that tend to protect
   these folks, generally under the catch-all "sexual orientation," but
   they are rarely enforceable in court (see bottom for an important
   exception).

   I fear the idea of opening up employment & labor law in some states,
   due to the sheer volume of anti-worker laws that are making it into the
   books right now in red and purple states; even the Oregonian,
   Portland's newspaper, recently editorialized in favor of what is
   basically a right-to-work proposal for public employees, although iirc
   they had the good sense not to use the words "right to work," knowing
   that people now know that "right to work" means "Union busting."  But
   that could be an important push in terms of bringing the various
   federal civil rights statutes up to date.

   Unfortunately, it won't make it through Congress right now, because any
   SCOTUS ruling will likely unleash an anti-gay backlash amongst the
   House GOP caucus (either failed attemps at legislating around a good
   ruling, or following up a bad ruling with further anti-LGBT laws);
   perhaps the 2014 election, if favorable to Democrats, might loosen the
   stranglehold a bit.

   As to my initial statement, that those bland equal-rights phrases are
   basically unenforcible, someone will surely come in and correct me with
   a fascinating case - indeed, given the right sort of commitment by a
   company and the right kinds of facts, non-discrimination could become a
   term of a lucky plaintiff's employment in the same way that, even
   without a contract, your salary and benefits are a term of employment,
   thus rendering retroactive pay cuts also violative of the law (among
   other reasons), and a crafty lawyer with great facts and great law
   might be able to run with it.

   The classic "great fact" might be a company manual, where the company
   writes in it, in clear terms, "In the absence of violations of our
   sexual harassment policy/dating in the workplace policy/etc., we will
   not fire employees for their sexual orientation," if the company
   otherwise lives by its manual and it's not just kindling for employees'
   fireplaces.  That kind of policy can become a term of one's employment.
    So the person who is fired for being lesbian or gay may indeed have no
   recourse, but they should still talk to a lawyer, even if a quick phone
   consultation - they might yet be able to get blood out of that turnip.

   Also note that I've seen Union contracts, which tend to regulate hiring
   and firing to at least some degree, that address non-discrimination -
   this was in Boston, as I recall, so it was a little duplicative of law
   that I believe the General Court had already passed (memory fails me),
   but as to other states, YMMV.  So if you're a member of a Union and
   you're terminated for what you believe to be a prohibited or unlawful
   reason, talk to your Union rep, if you trust them (use some judgment
   here), and if you have or can readily obtain a copy of your contract,
   read over it and bring it to any attorney that you speak to, even if
   nothing in it jumps out at you.

   Also, in response to the last paragraph of the article, I'm actually
   not as sure that Democrats have to create an economic contrast to
   Republicans in order to continue to win much of the youth vote; I think
   young people vote liberal for economic reasons as much as social ones.

 For an article that begins... ([544]0+ / 0-)

   '...what do we do after we win marriage equality....' to close with
   this...

     The Republican war on reproductive rights seems to be continuing
     unabated, which will continue to provide an unfortunate opportunity;
     but eventually, Democrats will need to provide a much stronger
     contrast on making sure young people believe that we have an economy
     that works for us. Republicans are working for exactly the opposite,
     and that contrast won't go away any time soon.

   ...is to close with a non-sequitor, isn't it?

   Did you run out of time and just decide to throw everything up against
   the wall and hope something sticks? "...making sure young people
   believe...," "...an economy that works for us...?" It's vague.

   It's schematic. Did the editors cut you off, did you lose focus, did
   you presume you'd already lost us, or did you decide to just start
   making shit up?

   high.  The Govt's deficit is the private sector's surplus....Govt
   budget surpluses actually confiscate and destroy more money from us
   than the Govt puts in to the economy.  For a growing economy with a
   growing population.....we need the new debt free money that the Govt's
   deficit provides....all other money is created as debt from the private
   banks...the private sector can only handle so much debt before the
   interest costs start to significantly eat into consumer spending power
