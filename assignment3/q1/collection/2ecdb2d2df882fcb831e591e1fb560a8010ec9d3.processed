   A banner of deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi hangs on a burnt
   annex building of Rabaa Adawiya mosque after the clearing of a protest
   camp around the mosque, in Cairo August 15, 2013. Egypt's Muslim
   Brotherhood called on followers to march in
   With the death toll [29]climbing past 500 in Egypt, President Obama is
   scheduled to make a statement at 10:15 eastern, speaking from Chilmark,
   Massachusetts. An audio-only livestream is available from the [30]White
   House.

   [31]7:30 AM PT: We're still waiting for the president to begin
   speaking, but if you're curious about US aid to Egypt--how much, where
   it goes, and who makes decisions about it--check out this [32]helpful
   explanation from ProPublica.

   [33]7:35 AM PT: President Obama says he has just met with his national
   security team. He stresses close ties between the US and Egypt. We knew
   change would not come easily, but stressed principles that had to be
   upheld.

   [34]7:35 AM PT: Morsi's government was not inclusive, and many
   Egyptians were calling for a change in course. Violence is not the
   answer, though.

   [35]7:36 AM PT: "The United States strongly condemns the steps that
   have been taken ... we oppose the pursuit of martial law which denies
   those rights to individual citizens."

   "Our traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual ... we are
   cancelling our biannual joint military exercise" and the administration
   will be considering further steps.

   [36]7:38 AM PT: The president calls for the state of emergency to be
   lifted and for all parties to cease violence, for the rights of women
   and religious minorities to be protected, and for transparency.

   [37]7:41 AM PT: As a final point, Obama observes that America cannot
   determine the path for Egypt; that must be done by the people of Egypt.
   "We want Egypt to succeed ... that's our interest. But to achieve that,
   the Egyptians are going to have to do the work. We recognize that
   change takes time and that a process like this is never guaranteed."

   [38]10:02 AM PT (Barbara Morrill): You can read President Obama's
   remarks in there entirety [39]here.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health

   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these

       Is there any reason to believe we helped the military overthrow
       Morsi?  Did we secretly want his overthrow--and sent those
       sentiments to our military friends in Cairo?

       A compliant media began the attack on Morsi, with the full support
       of the vast majority of politicians in Washington from the very
       first day that he was elected in an election that involved all the
       people in Egypt.
       Americans who truly support democracy worldwide are again shamed
       with the support of a military coup on a democratically elected
       government. In Egypt, terroristic killings by military goons of
       people participating in peaceful oppositions are rewarded with yet
       more US arms to assist in yet more murderous killings. How can
       politicians in Washington remain silent while these crimes against
       humanity continue?
       It's time to stop all military aid in the Mideast, and it is also
       time to join the rest of humanity in the support of a nuclear free
       Mideast.

       We knew or should have know the MB was going to win and should have
       worked very hard with Morsi to help keep things on a balanced
       course.

       Whatever we do has to be done softly. If we slap the military
       around, that is seen as endorsing the Muslim Brotherhood - even
       though the military does have some slapping due them. If we give
       full throated support to the military (God forbid), that makes the
       MB the heroic oppressed enemies of the USA.
       Anyone calling for President Obama to DO SOMETHING has to take into
       account that there will be a Newtonian opposite reaction.

   Did we supply intelligence?

       responsible for Mubarek's overthrow.
       Or, gee, maybe the people who actually USE the arms have agency and
       responsibility for how they use them?
       And the reason we have such close military ties with Egypt goes
       back to Camp David. So consider that the military aid not only was
       used for this coup, and the last coup, but also bought an end to
       direct Arab-Israeli war for 30 years. 1948 - 1973: continual war.
       1978 - now: Israel versus Lebanon a couple of times, and of course
       the ongoing mess with the Palestinians might not be quite so bad if
       Israel feared invasion; or it might be worse, it's hard to guess.
       Supplying arms to nation X does NOT mean total responsibility for
       how those arms are used. People who receive arms have power and
       responsibility as well.

 I happened across this article, which I found ([229]0+ / 0-)

   interesting and puts the Egypt situation in a whole new perspective.
   It takes a much broader view of the Muslim Brotherhood vs. the secular
   elements of Egypt (including the military) going back many years.  If
   this article is correct, the MSM is missing the boat once again.  And,
   many folks believe that, notwithstanding the efforts on both sides for

       The majority of "Egypt's Neighbors" do not have the capability to

       The major problem is that the Egyptian Military can look elsewhere
       for money. Do you want Russia and China to become even more
       powerful and influential in the Middle East.
       Plus, our economy is still totally dependent on oil. Sadly. And

       of all the oil we import from the Persian Gulf. Very little of that
       comes from Egypt. Very little. Most of our oil imports come from
       Canada and Mexico. There is poverty and killing going on in Mexico
       too. There is more than enough non-OPEC and Middle Eastern oil to
       supply our daily needs.
       And if Russia and China want to commit their resources to solving
       the Middle East's thousand year old problems, then by all means let
       them. Let them spend billions on naval fleets, counter-terrorism,
       propping up autocrats and what not. Let them get involved in
       Israel/Palestinian problems. By all means, we should welcome such a
       development as it would inevitably weaken both countries.

 25 percent of the oil is still a huge amount ([520]0+ / 0-)
       I just do not think you are being realistic. The reason Russia and
       China want access to the oil is so they can strengthen themselves.
       It will not weaken them.
       And then there is the whole issue that China and Russia also work
       as proxies for Iran in many ways.
       Do you have any proof that there is enough oil from non-OPEC
       countries to satisfy our demands? I wish it were so but I find that
       hard to believe.
       Frankly, it sucks we are still dependent on oil and I am not a
       friend of the oil countries by any means.. but that is the reality
       of the situation.
       By the way, the violence in Mexico is terrible, but not at the
       level of the ME. Furthermore, much of that violence is because of
       our War on Drugs, but that is a whole different issue.

 No it isn't a huge amount. ([524]0+ / 0-)
       Last year we imported 781 million barrels from the Persian Gulf. We
       consumed 6.9 billion of both imports (3.1 billion) and domestic
       production (3.8 billion). That's 11%. We could up the oil we import
       from the top 11 non-OPEC producers by 1% each and not import a drop
       from the middle east. Especially with the top 15 non-OPEC producers
       having proven reserves far in excess of what we currently import
       from them.

       in the Mideast. The military coup  reinstalls a military

       countries in the Mideast with enough oil to support all the major
       international players. Russia is an exporter of oil and not an
       importer.
       The biggest oil risk in the Mideast would be the launching of war
       on Iran. That could put a stop to the entire  Gulf oil
       transportation system. We would see a doubling of oil price should

   Your diagnosis is good:

   The MB thinks we engineered this, the generals think, well we don't
   know what they're saying in back channels

   I think you hint at the best option.  We must publicly pressure the
   military in a way that makes it more credible that we didn't support
   this coup, which may be impossible given our initial statements
   supporting it.

   I think I would go about this as follows:
   1) condemn the coup and the violence.  Call for quick elections.
   2) publicly announce a timetable for election that will trigger a
   suspension of military aid if not met
   3) state that human rights abuses in the future will trigger immediate
   suspension of aid

   4) I would convene a conference in, say, Italy with representatives of
   the MB including Morsi, al baradei, other civilian civic leaders like
   the Coptic pope, etc. It would be critical that the Turkish government
   is involved at a high level. Long story short we say to Morsi, you
   accept constitutional guarantees for minorities or go back to prison,
   and to the military, you accept whoever wins the elections or give up
   on our support

   Allow six months for the election with support for civic parties to be
   developed (maybe we can lend Dick Morris to the MB.  That should help
   the opposition) under a civilian interim caretaker government led by
   people who aren't allowed to stand for election.

   Something like that:  knock head until people talk. Everyone here is
   under a big stick.  Walking away means military dictatorship. If that's
   what we do, then understand that we have put our chip behind the
   dictator.

   You know, one thing I liked about Clinton is that he intervened in
   Haiti to restore a democratically elected president who didn't
   especially like us and wasn't a very good president I think.

 Unfortunately, the "lesson" of Algeria ([624]0+ / 0-)
       . . . post-1992, is that heavy-handed repression is the only
       alternative to Islamist political domination. There, the military
       cancelled elections that the Islamists were positioned to win,
       which lead to a decade of asymmetrical civil war in which more than
       100,000 people died. But in the end, repression won out - Algeria
       remains a tightly run police state.
       In my mind, there has to be a better way. Perhaps the least bad
       option would have been to respect the democratic process & wait
       until the next election, let the liberals, socialists & secularists
       coalesce into credible alternative to the Brotherhood/Salafists,
       then force them to explain why they've been unable to deliver on
       their promises. The major problem with the last election is Egypt
       is that the only choice available was between the Islamists & the
       remnants of the former regime.

   I don't think that it is good for any country for the government to be
   taken over by a religion.  That goes for all countries.  When religion
   dominates you are never going to have equal rights, human rights, or
   civil rights.  If Egypt really wanted to be a true democracy they would
   take religion completely out of the picture and choose an atheist or an
   agnostic to lead their country.  That way their president has no horse
   in the race and can make decisions based on common sense and equal
   protection under the law and not what one religious group wants or
   expects over the other.  That is just my opinion.

 With respect to US aid, the fundamental question ([709]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [710]Heart of the Rockies, [711]wadingo

   right now is whether the military leadership really cares about $1.3B
   in military assistance, an amount that doesn't go nearly as far as it
   once did. The Egyptian military's true economic might is their
   economy-within-an-economy. This piece at [712]Jadaliyya provides some
   useful background.

   With respect to US military aid purchasing influence (beyond "renting"
   maintenance of the treaty and privileged access to the canal), it is
   instructive to consider the written opinions of the current military
   leadership. See especially the paper that al-Sisi wrote in 2006 during
   his time at the US Army War College ([713]"Democracy in the Middle
   East") and the paper that Sobhi wrote there in 2005 ([714]"The US
   Military Presence in the Middle East: Issues and Prospects"). The
   current Egyptian military leadership seems far less venal than our
   Administration would prefer.
