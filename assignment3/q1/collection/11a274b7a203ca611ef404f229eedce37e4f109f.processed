[24]Privacy is what the intelligence chiefs say it is

   Shredded paper with word
   Don't worry your little head about a thing, the nation's top
   intelligence chiefs say, because [30]it's all about your privacy.

     NEW YORK (CNN) --The leaders of the top three U.S. intelligence
     agencies made an unusual joint public appearance Thursday to make a
     pitch for companies to cooperate more with the government in
     cybersecurity efforts, and defended the work their agencies do amid
     controversy over vast data mining programs that critics say invade
     Americans' privacy.

     National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith Alexander, FBI Director
     Robert Mueller and CIA Director John Brennan said the government
     does its best to ensure the work their agencies do is focused on
     protecting the nation from harm, while respecting privacy. [...]

     Alexander won applause when he said the NSA programs have been
     "grossly mischaracterized in the press" and that the system the U.S.
     government has come up with, working with the courts and Congress,
     works better than anywhere else in the world.

     He cited President Barack Obama's comments on a late night talk
     show, saying of the controversial NSA programs: "this isn't a
     domestic spy program" but rather a program to protect the nation
     from terrorists.

   He apparently missed the [31]blockbuster New York Times [32]article
   revealing that the "National Security Agency is searching the contents
   of vast amounts of Americans' e-mail and text communications into and
   out of the country." In other words, a domestic spy program.

   But it might all be in the semantics, again. Like when Director of
   National Intelligence Clapper [33]lied to a senator and then tried to
   say that really, it was all about how they defined the word "collect"
   differently. As in the dragnet collection of cell phone data isn't
   really collecting. Turns out, our intelligence officials also have
   their own definition of "privacy."

     The word "privacy" wasn't mentioned until the last few minutes of
     the 90-minute program. When asked whether Americans had any
     expectation of privacy nowadays, Brennan said, "I do believe privacy
     is important, but privacy can be defined in different ways."

   Don't you feel better about being spied on now? Your privacy^TM, as
   defined by the CIA and NSA and FBI, is completely protected.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       are included in a database that is searched for certain word
       patterns, I don't think that is an invasion of my privacy. That is
       in the end what this is about - whether we Americans view it as an
       invasion of our privacy to have our words included in massive
       searches looking for hidden signs of terrorist activity (only if
       such activity is detected are warrants obtained and our actual
       identities revealed to the government).
       We disagree on whether such anonymous inclusions of our data
       represent an unacceptable invasion of privacy. I certainly don't
       think it does, nor does President Obama, and based on the reaction
       of most Americans, I think the outrage we see here is in the
       distinct minority.

       You are rather more trusting than me, and this is one area where it
       might pay to be skeptical of the public remarks of the President.

       I have the right to be secure in my papers and to keep them away
       from eavesdropping government contractors, including my letters,
       electronic communications and web browsing habits. The government
       is absolutely welcome to obtain a warrant with just cause, then spy
       on anyone they have a reasonable suspicion of to the extent they
       need to spy on them. Until they get a warrant they do not have the
       right to look at any of my documents, papers, and communications.
       I'm not willing to give up that right at all.
       Why is this? Because of the potential for abuse and the long, long
       history of abuse by authoritarian governments for the extent of
       history. You and I both can easily come up with a multitude of
       scenarios where the government can easily abuse people because they
       have all private and public communications on file and indexed and
       cataloged at the push of a button.
       Not only that basic right, but we've also seen extremely limited
       transparency, secret oversight, our elected officials kept in the
       dark or threatened with treason if they reveal what little they've
       been allowed to know.
       What? Are we scared that "terrorists" will find out we're listening
       in on their conversations or reading their emails or following
       their GPS coordinates from their cell phones? The only "terrorists"
       who don't know this are the dumb ones who will get caught by normal
       everyday police work anyway. Sophisticated criminals have used
       burner cell phones, understand satellite orbits, use cells to hide
       members from other members, and have contacts and links inside
       government and military. We're not catching the real sophisticated
       "terrorists" with these techniques.

       Here is the hypothetical...
       Let's say the government has a tip about a possible terrorist
       attack, they have a name and email address, they get a warrant for
       that email address and find he has emailed someone you worked with
       who had emailed you.  Would the government be within it's rights to
       store (not review) your co-worker and your emails?

       You're not seriously suggesting that the government should have the
       right to capture all my communications because someone e-mailed me,
       are you?
       Not only that, but why did you put the "(not review)" part as an
       aside? It doesn't matter whether or not they review my
       communications. It's none of their damned business.
       If they want to name a suspect and get a court approved warrant to
       listen in on communications, review e-mails, look at bank records,
       they are well within their rights to do that.
       I like to think that any honest judge would laugh right in their
       faces if they came to them with a request for a spying warrant
       because "suspect received an e-mail from another suspect we
       received a tip about who could possibly be a terrorist."
       I regularly receive spam e-mails with spoofed return e-mail
       addresses and spoofed IP addresses purportedly from people in my
       contact list. My friends have also forwarded me obvious spam they
       says it was from me. Do you really, really, think the fact that
       simply because one person e-mailed another that that is just cause
       to track that person, store all their communications and keep all
       of this on file forever to be used as the government feels free to
       use as they adjust their missions and procedures and policies and
       laws and everything else?
       Really?

       I'm not offended at all by the question, only by the implication
       that you or anyone else is simply fine with the government
       capturing, indexing, and storing everything you say on your phone,
       write in an e-mail, or otherwise send over the internet or cellular
       phone network including where you go and when you went there.  It
       doesn't matter whether they review it or not, the simple fact that
       they possess it is ripe for abuse.
       The usual response from people who are ok with this is, "I don't
       have anything to hide."  And the reply to that is "if you have
       nothing to hide, then I'd like to see some nude photos of your
       wife, please."

 I want to clarify my thoughts ([210]0+ / 0-)
       It isn't about having anything to hide or not.  What I am asking
       is, does the government have a right to collect data from those who
       are in communication with suspected, or known, terrorists.
       Or even criminals...
       A real life example.  In El Paso, known drug cartels were using
       were using US Army soldiers as enforcers.  They would email an
       intermediary who would then contact the soldier for a hit.
       Would it be within the governments rights to follow the email chain
       even if they only had a warrant for the original email?
       I would guess, you would say no, but I am not so sure.

 A suspect or not? ([214]2+ / 0-)

                [215]chrismorgan, [216]CroneWit

       You're coming up with a somewhat simplified version of the
       [217]Ticking Time Bomb Scenario.
       My response is as usual, the government has every right to identify
       a suspect, get a warrant from a judge to spy on that suspect, and
       then proceed to capture whatever they're legally allowed to capture
       based on the facts of the warrant.
       They do not get to just grab all e-mail to and from everyone that a
       suspect e-mails. What if the suspect was a US Army soldier who just
       so happened to have sent an e-mail to an Army General or to his
       State Senator?  Would the government then have the right and duty
       to capture, catalog and store every e-mail the Army General sent
       and received even from his personal e-mail account? Why should it
       matter if this 1 "hop away" person is a General or you or me?
       Substitute "e-mail" with "telephone calls" and wonder if you'd be
       alright with having the government listen in on all your calls
       because someone, somewhere, misdialed your number. Would they also
       have the right to grab the sexy photos of your wife off your phone
       since sometime in the past someone e-mailed you accidentally? You
       ever have someone call you with a wrong number? How about a random
       text from someone you don't know or perhaps you are unlucky enough
       to get a new cell phone number that was previously used by some
       suspect?
       [218]They wouldn't do that, would they?

   There may be some extent of rights that some of us are willing to give
   up in the name of "security".  But I for one, Am unwilling to waste
   taxpayer money to build and maintain a massive security industry that
   actually guarantees very few of us security, and is turned increasingly
   on innocent citizens to accomplish secret ends.  We waste billions to
   secure a very small number of people, while 10's of thousands are more
   likely to be killed by preventable accidents and illnesses. If we were
   only willing to spend the same brainpower and tax dollars on them, we
   could do far more good, for far more people.  And we wouldn't have to

       I never said that the whistleblower leaks would, or even should get
       rid of the NSA.  Nor did I say that there shouldn't be ANY kind of

       We always have an enemy. For a brief moment in the 90's maybe we

       I do not believe in slippery slopes. Maybe there are 10 word

       What happens even if we eradicate terrorism? We now have tacitcly

       What word patterns now? What if they don't like Liberals. It's
       happened before. Are my Emails about the Zimmerman verdict, Civil
       Dispobedience, are those now a focus.
       It's not a slippery slope its an erosion that if you do ont speak
       out against you lose. See websites online reminding people to not
       let the police look in your trunk, home just because they guilt

   Obama's 'Tonight Show' Domestic Spying Comments Contradicted By New
   York Times Story

     Did Obama Lie On National Television?

     A New York Times article Thursday revealed previously unreported
     details about the United States' domestic surveillance program,
     namely that the National Security Agency is "searching the contents
     of vast amounts of Americans' e-mail and text communications into
     and out of the country, hunting for people who mention information
     about foreigners under surveillance."

     "There is no spying on Americans. We don't have a domestic spying
     program. What we do have are some mechanisms where we can track a
     phone number or an email address that we know is connected to some
     sort of terrorist threat," Obama told Leno.

     "That statement is just unbelievable and it reeks of this Orwellian
     newspeak," Timm told Shihab-Eldin. "When he talks to Jay Leno later
     in the clip, he says we can't listen to your phone calls or read
     your emails, and now we know with this New York Times story that is
     plainly not true. It is unfortunate that we have to parse through
     government statements a dozen times before we actually figure out
     what they are meaning to say. With all these questions that they get
     they are obfuscating and deflecting and deceiving the American
     public."

       emails only into and out of the country if people are using servers
       in the US to communicate, like a Gmail account.  Someone sending an
       email from and to a Gmail account doesn't have to cross
       international boundaries.  Now if someone logs in from a foreign IP
       address to read the email through a web browser, is that when the
       NSA determines the web traffic is an email and that email is headed
       to the foreign IP and that's when they say they can read it?  What
       about if the sender and receiver are both using US IP addresses,
       but the content contains the name of a foreign person of interest?
        It seems from some of the revelations that email will be flagged
       as well.
       At this point, I have to assume that all emails, texts, calls,
       video, web traffic and everything else that travels over the
       Internet is being collected, scanned and archived for further
       examination when someone or some machine determines there's a need
       to do that.  I don't see how there's any other way this Total

       There really isn't any other conclusion to come to. The systems and
       processes the government spokespersons have described simply do not
       work unless they hoover up absolutely everything on everyone. They
       don't have any idea what communications are inside or outside of
       the United States anymore than you do when you call a customer
       service telephone number.
       And especially now that these revelations have been rightly brought
       to light.  Any self-respecting anarchist or "terrorist" would
       simply get a VPN in the USA and do all their secret communications
       within the United States because aha! the USA can't spy on their
       communications there!  Muwwwaaahahahahahaa!
       Seriously, do these government spokespeople really think we'll buy
       that "only communications traveling across the border" are being
       monitored? It simply doesn't work and would be a laughable, useless
       program if that truly were the case.
       And to be perfectly clear, I definitely have a problem with my
       government capturing and cataloging and indexing every single phone
       call, e-mail, meta data, web browsing, etc. and I don't care if
       they can't get to it "unless they have a really good reason" or
       not.

 repeated assurances from Barack Obama ([347]1+ / 0-)

          [348]CroneWit

     The previously undisclosed rule change allows NSA operatives to hunt
     for individual Americans' communications using their name or other
     identifying information. Senator Ron Wyden told the Guardian the
     NSA's authorities provide loopholes that allow "warrantless searches
     for the phone calls or emails of law-abiding Americans".

      The authority, approved in 2011, appears to contrast with repeated
     assurances from Barack Obama and senior intelligence officials to
     both Congress and the American public that the privacy of US
     citizens is protected from the NSA's dragnet surveillance
     programs.[...]

   The data is anonymous? Think again. It certainly gets thrown away or

       for nefarious behavior. It isn't personal. So your emails are
       simply searched for certain incriminating patterns, and if the
       search spits your email out, further steps (including the
       involvement of a judge) must be carried out. There are people on

       One of the fundamental rights we enjoy in this country, with VERY

 That is a legitimate concern. ([407]0+ / 0-)
       An innocuous program goes bad and bad things happen. But that is
       not a reason to be against the entire program. It just results in
       the same concerns Pres. Obama has and Congress is charged with
       policing. Being against something just because someday, somewhere,
       it can be abused makes little sense. When and if there is a problem
       with it we as a society can deal with it.

       Follow the money and there is a heck of a lot of money being
       funneled into private companies to do our spying on behalf of the
       NSA.  The [466]cost to the taxpayers is enormous.

     Seventy percent of America's intelligence budget now flows to
     private contractors. Going by this year's estimated budget of about
     $80 billion, that makes private intelligence a $56 billion-a-year
     industry.
       With nearly a 1/2 million people with top security clearance and
       most of them private contractors, we have no idea what all this
       information is being used for or will be used for. The fact that it
       is there and ripe for the analysis is problematic regardless of any
       supposed controls. The potential for abuse against political
       enemies, against citizen activists, or for industrial spying is
       enormous and dangerous.

   As usual the spymasters have it exactly backwards. The public is
   supposed to have a reasonable expectation of privacy and rights to
   privacy under the Fourth amendment. The government is supposed to be
   transparent and accountable to the public.

   Alexander says the systems work so well, except those systems
   circumvent the very foundation of our Constitutional rights.  It has
   all been done in secret without normal accountability without public
   permission. We are simply expected to trust them, these very probable
   control freaks.

   As to Brennan, isn't privacy quite well defined, legally? Why is it
   they can't seem to comply with those known legal definitions? Hmm?

   last night on the Litvenenko case- Poisoned by Polonium. It was sort of
   a film essay by one of his friends, and he put together interviews and
   old footage to get at the question of why the FSB wanted him dead.

   There was a striking thing that Litvinenko said in one of his
   interviews, that the FSB has nothing to do with fighting terrorism,
   spying or national security. It exists purely for the purpose of
   keeping the oligarchy in power in Russia. Nothing more, nothing less. I
   think exactly the same could be said for the spying apparatus in this
   country.

   It is telling that this was a joint statement. The spying agencies
   traditionally are highly territorial, and this turf war mentality used
   to do a great deal to keep them in check. Now it appears that is no
   longer the case.

       especially as most of the info "leaked" by Greenwald/Snowden is
       over 5 years old.
       But that fragment we do have is enough to say "Enough, already!".
       No one is stopping anyone from critiquing Greenwald/Snowden, even
       though to do so is not very popular at DailyKos at the moment. But
       what makes you think that if G/S revel even more of what they have
       that the Surveillance State would come out smelling like roses?
       Because so far it has been the opposite: that more we know, the
       less we approve.
       BTW - the reason why we are "supposed" to question those in
       authority, be they elected or not, is that history is replete with
       examples of what happens when people do not question authority -
       and most of those examples paint an ugly picture... a very ugly

 Domestic spying program? ([856]0+ / 0-)

     "National Security Agency is searching the contents of vast amounts
     of Americans' e-mail and text communications into and out of the
     country."

   The bold was authorized by Congress.  And with the mails leaving the
   country, it's not exactly domestic.

   This once again fits into the hysteria over "can" versus "is."

   And I realize the counterargument is, how do you trust them?  Mainly
   because, as a Democrat, I have some level of trust that the people I
   consider good are doing the right thing.  If I didn't, then we might as
   well throw out government all together.

   Here's a serious question:  Given that it's now easier for the "bad
   guys" to communicate than it was 500 years ago, meaning that they can
   communicate without any physical interaction, not even physical mail,
   do people think that there should be no intelligence gathering that is
   expanded to include these forms of technology?

       however, the current Surveillance State apparatus treats everyone
       as if they're a "bad guy" - even little old ladies and toddlers get
       the pat-down at the airport.
       If everyone gets treated equally by the SS, then it becomes easy
       for a real "bad guy" to: set off bombs at a major sporting event;
       or [868]drive a SUV laden with explosives right into the heart of
       NYC, park it right under the noses of those who claim to be
       defending us, and then just walk away - only to be caught 2 days
       later after boarding a jet at JFK.
       But no "better" failure of the SS to protect the homeland (that is,
       after it's failure on 9/11) was that of the so-called
       [869]Underwear Bomber:

     On November 11, 2009, British intelligence officials sent the U.S. a
     cable indicating that a man named "Umar Farouk" had spoken to
     al-Awlaki, pledging to support jihad, but the cable did not give
     Abdulmutallab's last name.[62] On November 19, Abdulmutallab's
     father consulted with two CIA officers at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja,
     Nigeria, reporting his son's "extreme religious views",[5][63] and
     told the embassy that Abdulmutallab might be in
     Yemen.[8][17][32][64] Acting on the report, the CIA added the
     suspect's name in November 2009 to the U.S.'s 550,000-name Terrorist
     Identities Datamart Environment, a database of the U.S. National
     Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). It was not added to the FBI's
     400,000-name Terrorist Screening Database, the terror watch list
     that feeds both the 14,000-name Secondary Screening Selectee list
     and the U.S.'s 4,000-name No Fly List,[65] nor was Abdulmutallab's
     U.S. visa revoked.[17]

     U.S. State Department officials said in Congressional testimony that
     the State Department had wanted to revoke Abdulmutallab's visa, but
     U.S. intelligence officials requested that his visa not be
     revoked.The intelligence officials' said that revoking
     Abdulmutallab's visa could have foiled a larger investigation into
     al-Qaeda
       So even when the SS has a "bad guy" in their sights, they kinda
       sorta just let him do his thing - you know, like they did with the
       Boston Marathon bombers. Meanwhile, back at the airport, little old
       ladies and toddles get the pat down before boarding...

     Where is our Amsterdam? Lavabits, Snowden & Wikileaks Censorship
     recall age of Absolutism

     Posted on 08/09/2013 by Juan Cole

     The long struggle against censorship in the 18th century at the time
     of oppressive kings in Europe involved the hand-copying and
     circulation of unpublished anonymous manuscripts. Sometimes
     dangerous or proscribed books were printed in places beyond the
     reach of the French kings, in Amsterdam or Geneva.

     The struggle against censorship was not won with the almost
     miraculous First Amendment to the US constitution. The amendment,
     which forbids the government to establish an official religion and
     prescribes freedom of speech, the press, and assembly only slowly
     over the subsequent two centuries actually came to mean in practice
     some of what the words seem to imply.

     It only took a decade or so for the US government to abolish the
     First Amendment, taking us back to a censorship regime. It is not
     the censorship regime of the Sun King in France, but it more
     resembles that system than it resembles the world imagined in the
     First Amendment..........
