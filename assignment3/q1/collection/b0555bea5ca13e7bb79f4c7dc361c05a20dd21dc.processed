[22]I'm a liberal and I love Ted Cruz

   Michele Bachmann and Ted Cruz
   Ted Cruz: Smarter than Michele Bachmann, and just as effective
   National Review editor Rich Lowry [29]just doesn't get it:

     Democrats and liberal pundits would surely dislike Cruz no matter
     where he went to school, but his pedigree adds an extra element of
     shocked disbelief to the disdain. [...] One of the left's deepest
     prejudices is that its opponents are stupid, and Cruz tramples on
     it. [...] Cruz lacks all defensiveness about his positions, another
     source of annoyance to his opponents, who are used to donning the
     mantle of both intellectual and moral superiority. [...] He could
     spend decades making liberals recoil at what Princeton and Harvard
     hath wrought.

   So, according to Lowry:
    1. Ted Cruz is great because he drives liberals nuts
    2. Ted Cruz drives liberals nuts because he went to Harvard and
       Princeton, and liberals don't believe conservatives should be
       allowed to go to Ivy League schools

   I have to confess, I'm an Ivy Leaguer--I went to Yale--and I'm also
   liberal. But I don't hate Ted Cruz--I love him. I don't love him
   because he was born in Canada, though I've lived most of my life a two
   hour drive from the Canadian border--I love him because he's hilarious,
   from start to finish. I love Ted Cruz because he's a rare Republican
   who gives his own party more heartburn than he gives the Democratic
   Party. And most of all I love Ted Cruz because he's utterly and
   completely ineffective--and proud of it.

   Hardline conservatives couldn't ask for anything more than Ted Cruz.
   Unlike most of the clowns on the far right, he's intelligent, he's
   articulate, he's passionate, and he's true believer. But even despite
   all that, Cruz is still a sideshow, which makes him the exception that
   proves the rule. If someone with all the strengths of Ted Cruz can't
   turn teahadist dreams into reality, then nobody can.

   I probably don't love Ted Cruz in the way that Rich Lowry would like.
   But I don't hate him either. There's a difference between laughter and
   fury.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [43]Civil
   Rights, [44]Community, [45]Congress, [46]Culture, [47]Economy,
   [48]Education, [49]Elections, [50]Energy, [51]Environment, [52]Health
   Care, [53]International, [54]Labor, [55]Law, [56]Media, [57]Meta,
   [58]National Security, [59]Science, [60]Transportation, or [61]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([62]California, [63]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       I live 20 minutes from the Canadian border.  I work Downtown and
       sometimes look across the Detroit River with envy. It's so close
       you can see cars driving over there.  There doesn't seem to be the
       hate over there like here.  Repub whites are full of anger and are
       making their last stand.  I am white and are really disgusted with
       them.  They will not accept who we are as a nation. Their goals of
       obstruction border on treason.

   I don't get why the Ivy League angle is even an issue. Hell, Larry
   SUmmers used to be President of Harvard and he's one of the rightest
   righties out there, I don't care what the POTUS might think.

   I, however, attended a State school half an hour north of Detroit and
   got a great education. And I was even more liberal when I came out than
   when I came in.

   As for Cruz, he is entertaining. But he's also dangerous. Mostly
   because he's a Canadian. ;)

   I resent that. I demand snark, and overly so -- Markos Moulitsas.

   Ivy League schools. If you are in a very specialized type of science,
   you go where the programs and researchers are located. But, some people
   would still have us believe that their generic Ivy League degrees are
   inherent superior.

   I think people like Cruz hide behind the historical prestige of his
   expensive private schools. But, look at his actual reasoning abilities.
   He's really just a professional bullshiter who likes to quibble and
   debate people like everything's just a giant game at the debate club.
   But, he doesn't seem capable to reaching logical conclusions based on
   legitimate evidence.

 I'm sure Cruz is an impressive debater, VC. ([223]1+ / 0-)

                [224]VClib

       But, even as just a very amateur debater myself, having done
       Lincoln-Douglas, Policy Debate, and Impromptu, I can say that
       debate skills are different than reasoning abilities. So, I was
       just trying to draw that distinction.
       Generally good debaters are actually very good quibblers, harping
       on minute details regardless of whether they are really important
       or not. With good rhetorical skills, a person can flummox
       opponents, score points, and make people look bad without ever
       really getting to the heart of the matter being discussed. In fact,
       you're supposed to be able to debate any side of an issue, so it
       doesn't even matter if you really believe the position you are
       debating or not. It's really just a game of verbal gymnastics.
       That's why I said I think Cruz is a professional bullshiter who
       likes to treat everything like it's just a giant game at the debate
       club.

 In 1963 I was in the first Yale class to be ([294]0+ / 0-)
       more than 50% made up of public school graduates. Two years after I
       left, Yale started to let in women as undergraduates. When I went
       back for my 45th reunion last year, I was delighted to see how much
       more diverse Yale had become.
       But the bad old days are not completely over. John "Death Squad"
       Negroponte has been teaching graduate seminars at Yale for the last
       few years. I only met a few obviously evil sons of rich men there,
       but they were doozies.

       You also ask why Republicans are hypocritical liars. Well, let's
       see: with a platform consisting entirely of racism, bigotry,
       misogyny, More Guns More!!! and especially Mammonism, what could
       they tell the truth about? And with the base begging to be lied to,
       how could they not?
       The clearest case so far is Republicans claiming that voter fraud
       is both rampant and undetectable, and that voter suppression laws
       are aimed at voter fraud.
       Of course, if you define voter fraud as voting by Democrats, no
       problem.

   Because Barack Obama's credentials are similar to those of Ted Cruz,

   I'm willing to admit someone can graduate from an elite school and
   still be incapable of intelligently addressing our political problems.
   Many of the Masters of the Universe on Wall Street graduated from elite
   schools, and their political proposals mostly amount to MORE! GIMME!

   Rick Lowry, I think, knows that Ted Cruz is a very smart man saying
   very stupid things for political advantage. The issue Lowry would
   address if he had a microgram of intellectual integrity is why
   stupidity is required of politicians on the right.

   Cruz is not a serious with logical arguments. He is not reality based,

   is that leftists don't necessarily believe conservatives must be
   stupid. Among other things, there are plenty of reasonably bright and
   utterly amoral conservatives around. What shocks us is not how stupid
   all conservatives may or may not be -- what shocks us is how stupid
   certain very politically successful conservatives are. We are appalled
   that stupidity is simply not an obstacle to them. Sure, they provide
   endless amusement, but we can't figure out how to fight them. When
   voters are willing to elect and re-elect various individuals of
   well-documented mind-boggling dimwittedness ... what can we do? When
   29% of Louisiana Republicans blame BHO for the federal government's
   incompetent response post-Katrina ... what can we do?

   A guy like Cruz neither frightens nor angers us, at least not for
   violating some mythical Fundamental Principle of Leftist Hubris. He
   puzzles us, sure, and we find his policies and beliefs odious. So what?

   [709]http://nomoremister.blogspot.com/ had a great take on this today.
   He combined that post with another NRO post [710]"Keep Punching"

     Still, as the great philosopher Mike Tyson famously observed,
     "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth." The
     counter-punching from Cruz and Rand has already thrown the Left off
     its game, which is why it's reacted to Cruz like screeching vampires
     suddenly confronting a crucifix. They want to turn him into the male
     Sarah Palin, but there's those pesky little details like his Senate
     seat and his Harvard pedigree....

     No, we don't want to turn Ted Cruz into the male Sarah Palin,
     because we didn't turn Sarah Palin into the female Sarah Palin --
     she did that to herself, which is more or less what we expect Ted
     Cruz to do. We didn't fear Sarah Palin being a heartbeat away from
     the presidency because we thought she would be a devastatingly
     effective officeholder who would expertly skewer our sacred cows --
     if we feared her, it was because she's extreme and ignorant and
     about as emotionally stable as Anthony Weiner having a Cialis
     overdose. But starting in about late September 2008, we stopped
     fearing Palin at all. She'd beclowned herself.

     Snip

     Democrats don't do any of this. Even Democrats who hope a
     progressive champion will fight for the nomination primarily want
     someone who'll embody progressive values, not bash our enemies. If
     we wanted an enemy-basher, there'd be an Alan Grayson for president
     movement as large as the Cruz cult.

     Who's the dream candidate of progressives? Elizabeth Warren, who's
     unfailingly polite. Warren doesn't shy from a fight, but she doesn't
     seem to take pleasure in the act of fighting. I can't remember the
     last Republican cult hero you could say that about.

   That Cruz is considered intelligent is the biggest shock to me, given
   the ignorant things he's saying and doing.  Does he believe what he's
   saying?  Who knows.  But look at some objective evidence--the very
   wrong things he said about his [752]Canadian citizenship alone
   disqualifies him from the sharp-knives-in-the-drawer club.

     After producing his birth certificate yesterday, The Dallas Morning
     News pointed out that Cruz is actually a dual citizen. At first Cruz
     and his staff appeared to deny that he is a dual citizen. But in a
     statement just released from his office, he seems to have come
     around to the fact that he is in fact a dual citizen and says he is
     willing to renounce his Canadian citizenship

   This was something he neither anticipated or knew prior to making a
   huge announcement.  And I deduct even more IQ points for being 42 years
   old, a U.S. Senator, yet not knowing  he was a Canadian citizen...and
   then denying it at first.

   That Cruz is a product of Princeton and Harvard means nothing in
   isolation. Harvard's  reputation deserves a hard rap for [753]hosting
   economists who produce very bad studies, and for awardiing a Ph.D. to a
   graduate whose [754]doctorate was based on racist theories.    Sadly

 I think Mitt Romney is stupid ([833]1+ / 0-)

       The guy is rich as Croesus because of who his daddy is. Making
       money when you have money is not difficult. Especially if you're
       willing to ruin thousands of lives, raid pension funds, slash
       salaries, and direct all of the "saved" money into your pocket. And
       hire an army of accountants to do all the math for you.
       I don't respect that man's intellect one iota. Which is why he ran
       such a shitty campaign.

   Paul Krugman once said (or re-told) about Newt Gingrich:  Ted Cruz is a
   stupid person's idea of what a smart person sounds like.

 Dems don't fear the likes of a Ted Cruz ([853]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [854]Yosef 52, [855]aitchdee, [856]Van Buren

   Steve M. nails both Rich Lowry & National Review's Michael Walsh.

   Steve M. @ [857]No more Mister Nice Blog - Thursday, August 22, 2013

   Steve M.:

     Republicans are at it again: an ambitious member of their party has
     them seeing starbursts, primarily because they think this particular
     Republican terrifies and infuriates us.

   Rich Lowry:

     Democrats and liberal pundits would surely dislike Cruz no matter
     where he went to school, but his pedigree adds an extra element of
     shocked disbelief to the disdain....

     One of the left's deepest prejudices is that its opponents are
     stupid, and Cruz tramples on it. Chris Hayes of MSNBC actually says
     he fears Cruz's brilliance.

   Steve M.:

     (Try to follow the logic of that last bit: People on the left think
     all conservatives are stupid, as evidenced by ... a prominent
     left-leaning commentator saying that Cruz is actually very smart.
     Yup, makes sense to me.)

   National Review Michael Walsh:

     Cruz and Rand has already thrown the Left off its game, which is why
     it's reacted to Cruz like screeching vampires suddenly confronting a
     crucifix. They want to turn him into the male Sarah Palin, but
     there's those pesky little details like his Senate seat and his
     Harvard pedigree....

   Steve M.:

     No, we don't want to turn Ted Cruz into the male Sarah Palin,
     because we didn't turn Sarah Palin into the female Sarah Palin --
     she did that to herself, which is more or less what we expect Ted
     Cruz to do
     [...]
     Cruz is smarter than Palin -- a low bar to clear -- but he's naive
     if he thinks the road to the White House passes through the Valley
     of World Net Daily Talking Points.
     [...]
     But what is it with Republicans and their obsessive quest for the
     ultimate Dem-destroying nominee?

   Rebublicans fall all over the likes of  Herman Cain and before that
   Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. And many of them hoped that Trump or Ben
   Carson or Allen West or Cruz will be the nominee, just because they
   talk a lot of trash about Democrats and liberals.

   Steve M.:

     But they drive the eventual [republican] winner very, very far to
     the right, and quite possibly (in 2008 and 2012) to defeat.

   Dems otoh want their candidate to fight for our progressive values, not
   to spend their time earning their keep bashing the likes of a Ted Cruz.

   Who also will also never be President.

   That's why we don't fear him. We appreciate the exposure he's bringing.
   The suppuration will suface, to be cleansed out of our county's system

 Ted Cruz ([860]0+ / 0-)

   Who would have thought that the leader of the teabaggers would be a
   Canadian anchor baby.

   by [861]data free analysis on [862]Thu Aug 22, 2013 at 09:42:59 PM PDT



 I don't love him. He's scary because he's smart ([863]0+ / 0-)

   unlike most of the rest of them. I don't think he believes half of what
   he says. He's in it for the power.

   Bright man on a power trip. He is somewhat more effective I that the
   diarist seems to think. He's bad for our country and dangerous.

   I don't like Ted Cruz at all and have trouble being amused by him.

 The First Law of Human Stupidity ([866]0+ / 0-)

   If you agree with Carlo Cipolla's premises in [867]"The Basic Laws of
   Human Stupidity" wherein the First Law states that proportion x of any
   given group of people will be stupid (and the size of x will always
   exceed your expectations), then percentage x of Ivy League graduates
   will be stupid.  Ted Cruz certainly bears that out.
