   It is reassuring to know that talented and proactive people such as the
   Gates are focusing on the needs of children. I will endeavour to follow
   their example in my corner of the world. Pamela/Vancouver

   public education with driving public money into Religious "charter
   schools" that only rich kids can attend. Isn't that like lying to poor
