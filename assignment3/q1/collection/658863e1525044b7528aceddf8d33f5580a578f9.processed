[22]Open thread for night owls: Hasn't Summers done enough damage? Why not
Christina Romer for the Fed?

   Night Owls
   A week ago, Barry Ritholtz wrote [29]Anyone But Larry Summers ... That
   was before learning that Summers is apparently President Obama's choice
   to replace Ben Bernanke. As my colleague Laura Clawson [30]wrote
   Tuesday, Summers is not only a sexist but also has been a disaster
   across a wide range of economic policies. In January 2009, he wouldn't
   even present President Obama [31]with a $1.8 trillion stimulus proposal
   that Council of Economic Advisers chairwoman Christina Romer said was
   needed to create enough new jobs to restore the crippled economy.

   If payback were working properly, in fact, Romer would be the one
   getting the job at the Federal Reserve. There are other choices, too.
   Such as the Fed's Vice Chair Janet Yellen or Brooksley Born, former
   head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Summers, Robert
   Rubin and Alan Greenspan both ignored and smeared so they could carry
   out their devastating deregulation agenda.

   Of course, there's zero chance that we'll be surprised with someone for
   Fed head who is as modestly far to left as President Obama's two best
   Cabinet choices--Hilda Solis and Tom Perez--as Labor secretary. But a
   fella can still wish even when he can't hope, eh? Here's Ritholtz:

   Despite his alleged brilliance, he seems to exhibit what can charitably
   be described as the worst judgment of any economist ever in existence.
   Granted, discussing economists with poor judgement is an embarrassment
     of riches, but Summers manages to surpass that crowd in ways never
                            previously imagined.

    He is essentially a smarter version of Alan Greenspan -- only lacking
     Greenspan's keen judgment, insight and humility (in case it escaped
                       your notice, this is sarcasm ).
                 Consider Summers "brilliant" track record:

   o  He has consistently argued for privatization and deregulation of the
                              financial sector;

      o He oversaw the repeal of Glass-Steagall via the passage of the
                           Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act;

     o He approved the (previously illegal) merger between Citibank and
                                 Travelers;

     o He oversaw (and indeed encouraged) concentration in the financial
   sector, thinking bulked up banks are a virtue. This led to the rise of
            the TBTF institutions (formerly known as mega-banks);

    o He successfully fought Brooksley Born, then chair of the Commodity
        Futures Trading Commission, to rein in financial derivatives;

     o He oversaw passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of
    2000, preventing ALL Federal regulation of derivatives. The CFMA also
    exempted derivatives from state insurance oversight and antigambling
                                    laws;

       o Thanks to Summers, derivatives still have no minimum reserve
       requirements, no disclosure obligations, no transparency and no
               exchange listing/reporting requirements. [...]

   [32]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2008-- Downing
   Street Memo - July 23, 2002:

     Six years ago today, Matthew Rycroft, private secretary to British
     Prime Minister Tony Blair, wrote a secret memorandum to the U.K.'s
    ambassador to the U.S., David Manning. The memo contained the minutes
     of a meeting held that same morning between Blair and a few senior
     foreign policy advisers. It was exposed by the Sunday Times nearly
                three years later. Two paragraphs stood out.

   Rycroft spoke about a trip that Sir Richard Dearlove had recently taken
    to Washington. Dearlove, the head of the British Secret Intelligence
              Service or MI6, is referred to officially as "C":

     C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a
     perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as
     inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action,
     justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the
     intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy. The NSC
     had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing
     material on the Iraqi regime's record. There was little discussion
     in Washington of the aftermath after military action.

                             And there was this:

     The Foreign Secretary said he would discuss this with Colin Powell
     this week. It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take
     military action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the
     case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his
     WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran. We
     should work up a plan for an ultimatum to Saddam to allow back in
     the UN weapons inspectors. This would also help with the legal
     justification for the use of force.

    Many people who were attentive to the White House's public statements
     saw hints that a decision already had been made to invade Iraq well
     before that secret memo was sent to its select group of addressees.

   wingnuts actively misreads Obama's record to portray him as a hypocrite
   on "shoot first" laws. Plus: Nate Silver's move to ESPN. Gop unhinged:
   skewed Obamacare claims from IN Gop & why they're garbage; Kilgore's
   "Uh, Yeah, This Is a Different GOP"; Chait's "Anarchists of the House";
   Sargent & The Hill on Rs abandoning constituent service to sabotage
   Obamacare. "How Goldman Sachs is making your beer more expensive"; US
   Marshals lose track of millions in equipment. How "warrior cops," cheap
   tech & privatization combine to erase the unwritten checks & balances
   against govt power.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [59]Tagging tips - [60]Search For Tags - [61]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [62]Civil
   Rights, [63]Community, [64]Congress, [65]Culture, [66]Economy,
   [67]Education, [68]Elections, [69]Energy, [70]Environment, [71]Health
   Care, [72]International, [73]Labor, [74]Law, [75]Media, [76]Meta,
   [77]National Security, [78]Science, [79]Transportation, or [80]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([81]California, [82]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   the wrong person to chair the Fed, his arrogance is only exceeded by
   his ignorance, a toady to Rubin and his masters on the "Street," he is
   a walking technocrat disaster, narcissistic, misogynistic, and
   stubbornly wrong on almost every issue, a typical "New Democrat." An
   architect of the "Washington Consensus," economic policy that brought
   us the "tech bubble," the decline of worldwide labor conditions and
   pay, and topped off with the depression of 2008.

   He created a stimulus composed of almost 50% tax breaks for
   mega-corporations while allowing the unemployed to languish. He spent
   most of his time on the Council of Economic Advisers urging the Fed and
   Treasury to spend trillions of dollars to prop up failed banks,
   insurance companies and multinationals, he is the worst possible choice
   for this office and therefore will probably be proudly nominated,
   confirmed and ensconced in the Fed by the Villagers.

   Every time I wonder if I'm being too critical of Obama and search for
   something positive, he always comes up with something like this.

   I'm sorry the POTUS has incredibly bad judgement and likes to rely on a
   very, very small clique of trusted supporters in the WH and elsewhere.
    Its a feature, not a bug.

   There's nothing at all about Summers to indicate he's even a mediocre
   candidate for the job.  His skill set is minimal, he's a corporate
   sycophant who wants another shot at earning more money from Wall
   Street.

 Summers would be an appointment that's ([375]0+ / 0-)

   designed to fail.
   But then, the whole Fed is designed to cover up Congressional failure
   to manage the currency as it does other weights and measures -- i.e. to
   insure accuracy and integrity.
   The Fed is a money-laundering enterprise designed to insure that the
   money changers get a cut of every dollar spent without doing anything
   of any significance. Meanwhile, the Congress relies on rationing to
   reward the privileged and punish the electorate.
   Punitive measures work so well because we reward people when they stop

       .. due from one of my newspaper customers, i knocked on the screen
       door and called out the name of my customer who owned the Bar
       called the 'Vist Del Mar' on Kings Mountain, highway 35 (skyline
       Blvd.) just south and up the hill from up from I-92. I'm describing
       this locale because that bird just reminded me of another bird. the
       first I'd ever heard talk.
        There were 13 speak easy's along Skyline Blvd and winding down
       highway 35 to the ocean during the Redwood logging that went on.
        Lots of Bars as you head south up and along the ridge: The
       Mountain House, Vista Del Mar, The Belle Vista, The Red Pump (then
       became Alex's), Mr. Kelly's, The Kings Mountain Inn,  Alice's
       Restaraunt (at the corners), and one across the street I can't
       remember.
       And after turning off of Skyline at the corners heading west to the
       ocean on Highway 84;  Boots and Saddles, Venturi's, Baw's (Basil A.
       Willet's), and Peteson's Stop (almost to the ocean),
       Mrs. Jacobsen and her son Leonard lived in a cottage behind the
       Vista Del Mar; "Mrs. Jacobsen..hello.. I'm collecting for the
       paper". I called out
       I got an answer: "Leeo-nard.. "  It sounded exaclty like Mrs.
       Jacobsen herself calling out, loud and clear, as I had called
       through just a screen door. Her voice sounded mere feet away
       Again I called out, sure that Mrs. Jacocsen could here me since I
       could here her clearly as she was  calling (i thought) for her son.
       Again the answer: "Leeo-nard"..
       This went on for a minute or two, until I stepped around the screen
       door looked to my right.
       It was a minor bird, I could swear it was smiling as it looked
       sideways at me.

       argue that none of those people are liberals. Belief in global
       warming, for example, isn't evidence of a liberal disposition so
       much as it is evidence of basic scientific competency.
       It's refreshing anyway, particularly in this age when republicans
       have defined the expectations so low, but I wonder how many on that

   'Hold My Beer and Watch This' - Canadian edition

     Canadian Man Sorry for Chugging Eight Beers and Swimming to Detroit:

     John Morillo, a 47-year-old Canadian man, apologized today for
     causing an international incident last night when he drank eight
     beers and then swam across the Detroit River, just to prove to his
     friends he could.

     Speaking to the Windsor Star after being released from jail this
     morning, Morillo said in retrospect it was "really stupid" of him to
     drunkenly swim across the river, but not without adding that he
     wanted his incredulous buddies to know he'd pulled it off (emphasis
     ours):

   "The Mist-Covered Mountains"

   I'm posting this because I walked inside a rainbow tonight. I'm a
   lifelong sailboater, the skies and the winds and the clouds are my
   garden of eden, my engine. I saw an 80° F. snowstorm but of course it
   wasn't a snowstorm, it was raindrops brilliantly backlit by a setting
   sun under a blue-purple thunderless cloud sky.

   So then I remembered mist, for some strange reason, and this view I
   caught one morning rush hour in N. Puget Sound.

   At least half the future I've been expecting hasn't gotten here yet.
   Sigh.... (Yes, there's gender bias in my name; no, I wasn't thinking
   about it when I signed up. My apologies.)

 Romer? Seriously? God help us. ([1118]0+ / 0-)

   Here's the operative passage:

     Though Summers, like Romer, believed more stimulus was almost
     unambiguously better, he also felt that a $1.2 trillion proposal, to
     say nothing of $1.8 trillion, would be dead on arrival in Congress.

   I'd be honking horns and waving flags for her if she had developed a
   thoughtful mix of expenditures designed to stimulate the economy and
   spur job growth.

   The 2009 package was terrible if its goal was to stimulate the economy.
    Whether or not a bigger stimuls could have gotten through Congress --
   I'm very glad it didn't.  More is not better if more is spent badly.
   So, if that's what she believes, she should be tossed on the same shit
   as Summers.

   Summers activity in dismantling Glass-Steagall was more in the line of
   cheerleading, and, if you'll recall, he was far from alone in that.
   It's popular to blame Glass-Steagall repeal for the financial collapse,
   but it's hardly a unamimous position among economists given that
   Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the practices that caused it.
   Most of the argument is that Glass-Steagall repeal emboldened bankers
   and that boldness led to ruin.

   The big thing about Glass-Steagall is that it separated federally
   insured deposits from investment bankers' grubby little hands, and that
   was a very very good thing.  I don't believe in "too big to fail" for
   investment banks.  I sure hell, however, don't want them bleeding
   retail banks dry or bleeding the FDIC dry.

 Personally, I am convinced that persons whose ([1121]0+ / 0-)

   cognitive brain functions suffer a disconnect from the brain stem are
   inhibited in processing, but their accumulative and information storage
   functions are enhanced. So, the vastness of their memory bank creates
   the appearance of brilliance and distracts us from the fact that they
   don't know what to do with the information they've got. Imagine a
   walking, talking encyclopedia. Think of Google spewing out correct but
   irrelevant data. Think of General Alexander vacuuming everything up.
   Collecting and processing are very different functions. Think of a
   compost bucket and a food processor.

   We organize governments to deliver services and prevent abuse.

 Obama is content to be ([1124]0+ / 0-)

   one of the ruling elite and is ok with disassembling the republic and
   replacing it with an Oligarchy. In this care Obamacare was the act of a
   modern day Bismarck.

   or he is afraid of the .01 percent and must continue to placate them.

   neither of these options gives me confidence.

 Summers is a horror show.... ([1127]0+ / 0-)

   But who will be surprised after nominations like Brennan and Pritizker?

   I wonder, given the thinking inside the WH, whether the howls of
   outrage from liberals over Summers actually helps Summers' chances?
   Triangulation, you know.
