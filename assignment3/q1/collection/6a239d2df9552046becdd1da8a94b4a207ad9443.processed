[22]American Family Association director says 'homofascists' coming for
anti-gay Christians

   via [30]Right Wing Watch
   I don't know what exactly gay Americans have done to America's diverse
   collection of far-right imbeciles to convince them that we are so very
   close to rounding up all the anti-gay social conservatives and putting
   them in camps, but they're obsessed over the notion. First it was
   far-right talk show host Janet Mefferd, who I initially ignored because
   [31]who the hell cares about Janet Mefferd:

     Talk show host Janet Mefferd posted a link to Starnes' article on
     her Facebook page today, noting that she can soon see the "day when
     every Christian who supports real marriage might be made to wear a
     yellow patch on the sleeve, a `badge of shame' to identify us as
     `anti-gay haters.' Kind of like the Jews in Nazi Germany."

   Now American Family Association spokesthing Bryan Fischer [32]has made
   the near-identical claim:

     On his radio program today, Bryan Fischer discussed the same story
     and made a similar prediction, saying "we're getting to the point
     where these homofascists are going to force us to wear on our sleeve
     some kind of identifying marker so people will know who the racists
     and the homophobes and the bigots are":

   First off, do you know who else had to wear patches and were sent to
   concentration camps in Nazi Germany? That's right, gay people, so these
   twits should probably shut their goddamn traps about that particular
   subject. Second, homofascist really is a sparkler of a word, and really
   brings home both the intense hatred and the abject stupidity that makes
   Fischer such an eloquent spokesman for the far-right radical fringe.
   What a treasure.

   And third: Really? These people really think that there is an
   ultra-powerful gay lobby that is only one or two more signatures away
   from putting all the nice bigoted quasi-Christians in jail? How the
   hell do these people get through each day without melting into a tiny,
   bile-filled pool of rage and paranoia? Do they really walk down the
   street in terror, lest one of America's many ultra-powerful gay people
   come right then and there to take them and their fellow nutjobs away?
   Oh--and are the gay people in league with the United Nations? What
   about the manatees, are the manatees involved too?

   How do you get this nuts? And why the hell would you want to?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [50]Tagging tips - [51]Search For Tags - [52]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 It's true! Everyone knows that TEH GAYS routinely ([134]1+ / 0-)

                [135]Minnesota Deb

       Harass straight 'Christians' in high school, to the point that many
       of them attempt suicide. NOT!
       We know that TEH GAYS have shot up innocent 'Chistians' in bars and
       churches. NOT!
       In fact, the harassment and violence has come from these so-called
       'Christians'....
       And another pet peeve of mine:  could we stop calling these folks
       'Christians' as if they are the only TRUE denomination in the
       Christian faith?  Their self-proclaimed and self-promoted title as
       'Christians' is an affront to all other adherents to the other
       Christian denominations in the world.
       Call them what they are: Homophobichristians or ultra right wing
       fundamentalists but stop with the simple moniker Christians.  The
       MSM slanders the message and spirit of Jesus by calling these folks
       'Christians' without some form of modifier.

   When a liberal says this kind of thing about a right-wing group.

   This has been another simple answer to easy questions.

   Of course this is just another example of the blatant, ugly, double
   standard used to discredit the left and ignore or condone  the
   mendacity, hate-mongering, and terrorism of the right.

   If a left winger of any stature had gone on the radio and claimed the
   "christofascists" were planning to round up all the DFH's and send them
   to concentration camps, the MSM would plaster it across every front
   page and television screen in America as solid proof that the left and
   the Democratic Party are  a bunch of crazy, stupid, filthy hippies who
   are born traitors to America and deserve to be ridiculed for all of
   time.

   If a rightie does it... no big thing. (chirp, chirp)

       A while...I just don't know where it originated.  'A touch of
       lavender' was a term in the 30's and 40's for someone who seemed to
       be possibly gay.  I think it originated either in the insinuations
       that the color lavender was effeminate or that lavender was a
       constituent of perfume worn by women of that era.

       Right wing name-calling is generally pretty juvenile and cringe

       kinda like the new one, "homofascists". That's pretty funny,
       really.
       I'd love to see battalions of pink-camo clad homofascists join our
       War on Xmas allies (with their red and green camo)  this year!
       Maybe the homofascist officers can wear lavender!

   These people have a single default setting that says: If you don't like
   someone, round them up and kill them.

   Were they given even the slightest smidgen of real power, you know they
   would be rounding people up and sending them to camps. It's how they
   think. It's what they dream of: Killing, death, torture, power
   unlimited, total domination of all life, total elimination of all
   freedom.

   They simply can't imagine that everyone else in the world doesn't think
   the same way.

   Since I want to do it to you, you MUST want to do it to me, which

   Partly this is a response to their declining socioeconomic  position
   because of the changes in the last 20 or so years, and partly it is
   individual insecurity fanned by other bigots.  Some of them, like

     The goal of the Jew is to make himself the ruler of humanity.
     Wherever he comes, he destroys works of culture. He is not a
     creative spirit, rather a destructive spirit.

     He corrupted Germans through bad books, and mocked true literature
     and German music, replacing it with ungermanic music. Everywhere,
     his influence was destructive.

     I say Jewish domination intentionally, for there is no more dreadful
     tyranny than when world Jews enslave their host people through their
     willing, bribed, and obedient democratic lackeys.

       In fact, it was through a coalition with the (Catholic) Center

       The church only got upset when the Nazis started classifying people

       under the Nuremberg Laws around 1935. Then the Nazis started
       sending the Gestapo to monitor sermons in 1936.

 Persecution is fundamental to their belief system. ([603]0+ / 0-)

   Much of the U.S. Protestant culture, in my experience far more than
   Catholic (history as state church?), has a deep stripe of "the world"
   against them and lions ready and waiting down below the sands of the
   coliseums. It is relatively faint in the old "mainstream"
   denominations. When you get into the hard core fundamentalist and
   evangelical sects that make up the religious right that escalates to a
   real sort of paranoia.

   Even where they dominate, such as small Southern towns I once knew,
   there is a culture in language and thinking of a vast satanical
   conspiracy just waiting to dump them out on those sands to be martyred.
   I can remember when it was "movies" and "bootleggers" ready to cheer
   the lions. If you want to hear some of that stuff just go to some of
   the AM radio or cable channel wastelands of evangelists and "they are
   waiting" to send us to the lions is a pretty frequent theme.

   Hell, it is "exciting" to think of yourself as among a small group of
   belief risk takers, huddling against evil even when 80% of your town is
   like minded--very similar to the survivalist waiting for the Red dawn
   forty years ago.

       Just look at what happened why we tried to go from the christian
       priests and ministers who raped and molested children.  All the
       other christians formed a  perimeter around them and protected
       them.  We have had very little success.
       Once, in Waco, the christians murdered all their children instead
       of allowing the law in.
       Recently there was another arrest of  christian man who was
       molesting teens, and all his disciples said that they had given
       these girls to him to marry, and getting any kind of trial was
       really difficult.
       So this paranoia is really just that.  If we can't just round up
       these people and throw them in a volcano for molesting children,
       are we really going to be able to do anything?

   of these fundamentalists revel in the thought of being persecuted by
   those who they deem less holy.  They can thus feel superior and holier
   than others by flaunting the symbols of their persecution.  Just look
   at the statues of saints - St. Sebastian with his arrow holes, St.
   Denis carrying around his severed head, St. Francis and his bed of
   nails or whatever sharp things he enjoyed sleeping on, etc., etc.  Not
   to mention Christ on the cross.  To Fischer and his ilk, being
   persecuted is better than sex (sex, of course, is not to be enjoyed and
   so they have to get off on something even if they have to manufacture a
   fantasy persecution to satisfy their desires).

       ideology, and for a very long time, it almost never had to share
       the stage with any other religious group or ideology, as an equal.
       For the last 60 years, serious inroads have been made by various
       [perceived] rival religious groups and ideologies for equality in
       the Western World.
       Knocking Christianity in general, off of their "top tier" position.
       Now, they are increasingly finding out that, "they are special,
       just like everyone else."
       And this is the most predictable song and dance, every time a new
       group achieves some semblance of equality.
       It used to be, if you didn't go to church, you were an outlaw, you
       weren't proper, and were worthy of suspicion, because church via
       Christianity, was the one way to connect with a community, and to
       gain a support network outside of your family.
       Churches are becoming irrelevant, esp Christian Churches and
       especially the most conservative Christian Sects, because very few
       people want to adhere to such strict rules, especially when the
       Federal and State laws grant them rights and status, the church
       would otherwise deny them.
       So the tantrum is understandable. And it also makes the point for
       us, just how myopic many of these groups are, when it comes to
       defining concepts like humane, compassion, tolerance, acceptance,
       equality, and Freedom of Conscience.

       I have no idea how this will manifest in S. America or India,

       an unholy mess of things.

     The average person....is made to believe that he must choose between
     compulsive (legally enforced) sexual morality on the one hand and
     sexual anarchy on the other hand.
         -Wilhelm Reich, The Mass Psychology of Fascism

   I wasn't really looking for a historical precedent for the recent spate
   of referendums banning gay marriage, but this caught my eye:

   [1158]http://en.wikipedia.org/...

        In the mid-19th century, the fiercely anti-Semitic völkisch
     movement appeared in Germany. One of the major demands of the
     various völkisch groups had been the disemancipation of German Jews
     and banning sexual relations between those considered to be of the
     "Semitic race" and those considered to be of the "Aryan race". In
     1881, a petition presented to the German government by the völkisch
     groups demanding Jewish disemancipation and the banning of marriage
     and sexual intercourse between "Aryans" and "Jews" had collected
     over a million signatures.

   As the Nazis tightened their grip on Germany, oppression of the Jews
   continued, leading to the enactment of Nurmeberg Laws. Like any
   sociopath, the Nazis claimed to be "saving" something. In this case,
   the German people were told they were being saved from all sorts of
   sexual corruption

   But of course in announcing the Nuremberg Laws Hitler had to claim
   there was a conspiracy (homosexual agenda anyone?) and that he was
   merely acting in self defense:

        ...Bitter complaints have come in from countless places citing
     the provocative behavior of Jews....a certain amount of
     [conspiratorial] planning was involved....[To prevent] vigorous
     defensive action by the [Aryan] people, we have no choice but to
     contain the problem through legislative measures. - Adolph Hitler

   And if you read the Nuremberg Laws, it's hard not to think "Christ on a
   cracker, it's DOMA!

   They put it on themselves when the open their mouths.

   It they could keep secret their hatreds as effectively as homosexuals
   keep theirs, they wouldn't have to be afraid of being found out.

   However from their point of view gays and women and Blacks and Browns
   make up a huge percentage of the population and we are very very tired

   Well, given the sudden sea-change of opinion among the general public

   general public will "go along" with any plan this nefarious group of
   gay evil-doers cook up.

   In Revelations it's clear that many of those who end up on the

   They do not believe in any real psychological state OTHER than

   People are inherantly evil, they believe. Just like themselves, and

   At least 100,000 homosexuals were arrested during the Nazi regime, and
   many of those were murdered, or imprisoned, or sent to concentration
   camps where, of course, many of them died.

   In the concentration camps, homosexuals were forced to wear pink
   triangles to denote their status.

   Thus, it takes a hell of a lot of ignorance to compare gay people
   fighting for equal rights to "fascists." A hell of a lot of ignorance
   to claim gay people are going to make straight people wear patches to
   identify themselves as homophobes and Christians. A hell of a lot of
   ignorance, and a hell of a lot of hatred and spite.

   As others have pointed out, these right-wing religious extremists are
   using Rovian and Nazi propaganda techniques.

   "All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be
   adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed
   to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the
   lower its purely intellectual level will have to be... The receptivity
   of the great masses is very limited, their intelligence is small, but
   their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these facts,
   all effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must
   harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public
   understands what you want him to understand by your slogan." --Adolf
   Hitler

   Fischer is neither crazy nor stupid. He has, however, found that he can

 Communism Compared To Fascism ([1394]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1395]gffish, [1396]Minnesota Deb, [1397]Apost8

   Were Fascism and Communism the same thing?

   Only conservatives make this argument, and in fact they usually embrace
   many Fascist conspiracy theories. So they say that since they aren't a
   Communist, then they aren't Fascist either, despite believing many
   Fascist conspiracy theories and the talking points on the previous
   list.

   The Differences between Fascism and Communism are fundamental:

   Fascism is explicitly racist and focused on racial purity. Communism is
   not racist, which allowed it to spread to many countries. Fascism
   attacks immigrants as the "enemy within."

   Fascism condemns "class warfare" and creates new classes that may
   reduce certain people to slaves.  Communism is all about "class
   struggle"

   Fascism protects private property and factory owners. Communism
   promises that the workers will control the "means of production."

   Fascism is a "spiritual" movement and condemns Communism's
   "materialism" (pseudo scientific rules). Marx used "dialectic
   materialism."

   Fascism is almost never atheist. It may embrace organized religion, but
   it will usually use "syncretism" - a mixture of beliefs. Fascist
   countries may have an official state religion, and Hitler came to power
   by pandering to Christians. Communist societies are often officially
   atheist.

   Fascism will destroy society to return to the Utopian past. Socialism
   will destroy society to create the Utopian future.

   Fascism believes human nature is cemented by their racial identity -
   people don't change. Communism believes that man and nature are plastic
   and can be molded by society.  People in China and Russia starved
   because their crop scientists were forced to reject genetics.

 Bryan Fischer isn't the media ([1410]1+ / 0-)

   This show isn't any different than Hannity on FOX except Fischer is the
   crazy uncle no one talks about in public and his audience is far less.

   Besides if homofascists actually existed the AHA would be the first
   thing shut down

   Yes keep an eye on people like Fischer but don't expect the "media" to
   care about him

   This is disturbing.  It reminds me how the Hutus in Rwanda whipped up a
   frenzy by claiming the Tutsi's would kill all Hutus.  So it was "kill
   or be killed".  It worked -- one million people in 100 days (or
   something like that).  I don't think that will happen here, but it's
   the same kind of tactic -- scare people into believing they are in such
   grave danger, they have to do SOMETHING.  When the SCOTUS decision
   comes down in June, all hell may break loose.

   The civil rights, gay rights and women's movements, designed to allow
   others to reach for power previously grasped only by white men, have
   made a real difference, and the outlines of 21st century America have
   emerged. -- Paul West of LA Times

   It all boiled down to servicemen being terrified that big gay soldiers
   will do to THEM what THEY'VE been doing to serviceWOMEN all these
   decades.

   These mean, petty, small-minded, pinch-mouthed, hateful assholes (oops,
   I meant Christians) are soiling themselves in terror, imagining people
   as evil as themselves finally gaining an ounce of political power and
   using it as they themselves would use it - to hurt and oppress and
   destroy their opponents.

   If we put them in any outfit, it most certainly would not involve a
   badge.  Holocausts non-withstanding, no gay fascist in his right mind
   would put anyone in any outfit any time, ever, that would involve a
   badge.  Eww.

   secondly, these folks need to buck up and quit whining.  I mean, yes,
   it does look like we ARE so much more attractive, cultured,
   compassionate and cosmopolitan than they really could ever hope to be.
    But that certainly isn't all of us.  Just the ones they secretly
   fantasize about.

   lastly, some of us dream of solutions a bit more final than a fucking
   badge.  but that can only happen after we take all their
   guns......KIDDING.  we can't take all their guns.

   Damn it, I would've been the Simon Cowell of death panelists!

   Westboro Baptist is NOT the exception for these "Christian" groups.
   Westboro Baptist is the Norm for these splinter groups of the American

   previous purges, once the gays are gone, what group is next?

   Is this kind of craziness some delayed effect of leaded gasoline fumes,
   or nuclear testing or something?  It seems to be an epidemic plaguing
   the country.  I know there have always been crazies, but it seems so
   much more prevalent.  I dunno.
