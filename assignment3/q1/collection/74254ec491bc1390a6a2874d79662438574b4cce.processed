[22]House Republicans launch site where the public can 'cosponsor' bills.
Sigh.

   Header of the 'cosponsor.gov' website, featuring Eric Cantor
   Next, we'll allow you to Instagram our filibusters.
   While noble-sounding in premise, I find the execution of this [29]to be
   agonizingly cynical:

     Majority Leader Eric Cantor is launching a website allowing
     individual citizens to "cosponsor" bills, the latest in a series of
     online initiatives to increase transparency of the House.

   The site, [30]cosponsor.gov, features a small set of "featured bills"
   on the front page and a button to "view all bills" that takes you to
   the rest. At the moment, the "featured" bills consist of an
   anti-abortion bill, a "Kids First Research Act" that oh-by-the-way
   eliminates taxpayer funding of presidential campaigns, a border
   security bill, an anti-Obamacare bill and two employee-screwing bills,
   all of them GOP-sponsored. So this is your rare opportunity to "like" a
   bill by Virginia Foxx on Facebook, if you're into that sort of thing.

   This, though, is the cynical part:

     Cantor is in charge of deciding which bills come to the House floor,
     and I asked him how much weight he would give to the recommendations
     of the users on his new website. "I don't think there's necessarily
     going to be a threshold," he said. "I think that it certainly will
     be one of the things that our Members, both Republican and Democrat,
     will be able to weigh in terms of how they look at particular issues
     and bills making their way through the process."

   In other words, the site will "feature" prioritized GOP bills, list the
   other bills elsewhere, and the public actually expressing support or
   disdain for a given bill won't constitute any "threshold" for taking
   action on it, so sucks to be you, people who actually vote on these
   things. The "featured" bills right now, for example, aren't even the
   ones with the most  online votes. That distinction goes, sigh, to a Rob
   Woodall bill to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and replace it
   with a national sales tax, because of course it does. Given the _very
   small number of votes on each bill so far, it also seems an arrangement
   perfectly suited to astroturfing, so I guess it's good Cantor says they
   won't be paying much attention to the actual results anyway.

   There's another minor issue here, which is that "transparency" is
   perhaps overstating things a bit. In actual practice it's achingly
   non-transparent: I defy any of the Facebooked supporters of Virginia
   Foxx's "SKILL Act" to [31]read the thoughtfully provided text of the
   actual bill and come away with any glimmer of understanding as to what
   the bill will do or why it does it. For government watchdogs it's a
   good thing, but for Facebook-based voting wars it's all but useless.
   Instead, the only thing most participants will know about each bill is
   the syrupy-sweet bill titles and one-sentence rah-rah summary that does
   not necessarily have anything to do with the actual purpose or effects
   of the bill.

   A tool like this can indeed be useful to the public, but Congress is
   probably the last place that should be implementing it. Cantor and
   [32]Boehner seem to be heralding the effort as a triumph of Republican
   techno-savvy, but it's just an online poll. Literally. And online
   polls, to be blunt, suck.

   A better, more "transparent" effort would consist of actual
   explanations of the bills, submitted by bill proponents and skeptics.
   An effort might allow the public to make their own arguments for the
   bill (a comment thread on a government site, what could possibly go
   wrong with that, eh?)--anything rather than collecting Facebook
   "follows" for bills, which may be the most depressing representation of
   democracy ever.

   I'm going to go out on a limb here, however, and say that the end
   result of this is going to be to bite Republicans in the ass. As I
   said, individual votes for bills are currently at such low numbers that
   they could easily be overwhelmed by partisan pushes on either side, and
   the GOP has a rather poor track record of having their own online
   efforts subverted by nasty non-Republicans (Twitter hashtag wars,
   anyone?) God help the Republicans if the Democrats start using it too.

   [44]Tagging tips - [45]Search For Tags - [46]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Daily Kos is as close as it comes - ([297]0+ / 0-)
       if you frame the cause you want as legislation and promote it well
       in this space often enough, and it has salience in this community,
       it will sooner or later get picked up by major media or an actual
       legislator or gain a following in the mainstream.  That's what
       activism is all about. It takes patience, persistence, flexibility
       and vision. But if you follow any new piece of meaningful
       legislative change, it all began with a single voice, then a small
       group, then an organized effort, and so on. The point is to keep it
       on track and constructive...
       Kos isn't the only vehicle of course, but it's a good example...
       "Gun violence places a tremendous burden on America's health care
       system. Direct medical costs for gunshot wounds total more than six
       million dollars a day." - The Violence Policy Center

 This is a pretty bad idea ([305]0+ / 0-)

   If for no other reason, than because democrats make much better
   activist and are much more active on the internet. If the dems did this
   they'd get 10x the number of "co-sponsors" the GOP would.

   In general I have no use for pranks like this. And it's not just them,
   like Kos, I also hate the "Tell X to apologise" stuff and all of Alan
   Grayson's petitions (does he still do that?) as well. It's all just an
   attempt to collect email lists anyway.

 I took a look ([317]0+ / 0-)

   As you mentioned, the bills where full text was provided were
   impenetrable -- Virginia Foxx's was nothing but amendments to previous
   legislation, which you would have to have sitting in front of you to
   edit line by line in order to understand what the bill means.  But
   bills for increasing use of wind energy on public lands and grants to
   state and local governments for solar power did not have full text OR
   EVEN AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY available.  That's asking someone to take an
   awful lot on trust.

   Meaningless posturing, and any voter with a brain will realize that.
   Of course, by now we know very well that most Republican voters are
   lacking that essential organ.
