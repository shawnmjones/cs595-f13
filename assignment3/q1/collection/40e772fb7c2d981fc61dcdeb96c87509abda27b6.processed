   (CNN) -- The 17-year-old drew his suicide note in strips of wet toilet
   paper on the floor of his jail cell -- a concrete box where he was
   being held in isolation.

   "I'm sorry 1 4 3 fam," Kirk Gunderson wrote.

   [46]Code for "I love you, family."

   It's impossible to know what, exactly, pushed Kirk to tie a prison
   blanket to a smoke detector grate and hang himself on December 27,
   2005. But Vicky Gunderson -- who remembers her son for his bright laugh
   and caring temperament and who described his suicide note and cell to
   me -- believes Kirk lost hope and the will to live when he was
   transferred from a regular cell at a county jail in Wisconsin into
   solitary confinement.

   When he took his life, Kirk [49]was awaiting a court hearing for
   stabbing his dad and brother. He was addicted to Oxycontin and had
   suffered nine or 10 concussions from playing sports, Vicky Gunderson
   said, and was likely in some kind of altered state at the time. She
   said the family had forgiven him for the attack.

   Her son was transferred to solitary confinement, according to jail
   records she provided, because he was hiding materials that could be
   used in self-tattooing, which put him in violation of the jail's rules.

   Kirk killed himself only hours later.

   "We needed the justice," she said, "(but) not at expense of his life."

   She's dedicating her time to ending solitary confinement. She firmly
   believes that her son would be alive in jail today if he hadn't been
   locked up alone.

   "Seriously, would you lock up your animals and never let them see
   sunshine?" she asked me during a recent interview. "Would you lock up
   your children and never let them get a breath of fresh air? And that's
   what it is. I don't care who you are. I don't think you deserve to be
   in solitary confinement."

   I don't either. And I bet most reasonable Americans would agree.

   The problem is that many aren't aware of what's happening.

   Raising alarm on solitary confinement
   Living in solitary confinement

   With relatively little outrage, the United States has become the world
   capital for solitary confinement. [50]Kids, [51]immigrants, [52]people
   with mental illness -- all can be subjected, somewhat regularly, to
   solitary lockdown, according to human rights groups and news reports.
   Between 20,000 and 80,000 people are thought to be held in solitary
   confinement on any given day in the United States, making the practice
   more common here than in any other country, said Juan Mendez, the
   United Nations' special rapporteur on torture and other forms of cruel
   punishment.

   "The U.S. leads the pack by a long, long shot," he told me.

   In solitary -- also called "the box" and "the hole" by prisoners, or
   euphemistically, "segregation" and "special housing" by corrections
   officials -- inmates have virtually no social contact, except for
   occasional transactions with guards. They're kept in isolation for 22
   to 24 hours a day, usually coming out only to exercise.

   There's no conversation. No interaction. Often, no books or TV. Inmates
   have described the "patterns" that their feet wear into concrete floors
   from pacing back and forth for days, weeks, months -- years, in some
   cases.

   It strips them of their humanity. Many of these people will be put back
   into society. The most self-interested way to think about the issue is
   to consider whether you would want to be neighbors with someone who had
   been held in isolation.

   After hearing some of their stories, I wouldn't.

   The practice doesn't rehabilitate. It punishes, cruelly.

   "All you have is your brain," Brian Nelson told me.

   The 48-year-old, who now lives in Chicago and is the prison rights
   coordinator for the Uptown People's Law Center, said he spent a total
   of 23 years in solitary confinement, 12 years consecutively, most of it
   without TV or a radio. Nelson was convicted at 17 of armed robbery and
   murder. In lockdown, he made somewhat futile attempts to pass the time,
   copying the full text of the Bible (it took one year, nine months and
   two days), and pacing for 18 hours a day. "I paced so much that they
   would take me out and cut the blood blisters off the bottom of my
   feet," he said.

   The feeling of being in solitary is almost impossible for him to
   describe.

   "I ask everyone (who asks about solitary confinement) to give up their
   cellphones, their TVs, everything, for a weekend, and then lock
   themselves in the bathroom," he told me. "Most of the people who try it
   come out after a few hours. They're like, 'No.' "

   About two years after being let out of prison, he said he's still jumpy
   when people come close. At first, he isolated himself even from family
   members, staying in a basement. "No one was sure if I would be able to
   come out of that cell and be part of the family," he said. "Cell," in
   this case, seems to refer to the one in his mind.

   "I would rather have you beat me with sticks -- I would rather have you
   beat me than put me in solitary," he said.

   Sadly, there are plenty of other stories like his.

   "I really felt myself losing my mind, you know. I had a fly in my cell
   for two days and I was sitting there talking to this fly. It was like a
   person," said 37-year-old [53]Five Omar Mualimmak, who said he was in
   solitary confinement for about five years. When the fly disappeared
   from the cell, he told me, he broke down in tears.

   "I've experienced times so difficult and felt boredom and loneliness to
   such a degree that it seemed to be a physical thing inside so thick it
   felt like it was choking me, trying to squeeze the sanity from my mind,
   the spirit from my soul, and the life from my body," [54]one New York
   inmate, William Blake, wrote in an essay posted by SolitaryWatch.com.

   "You know, I haven't been outside for 13 years. I haven't seen sunlight
   or felt the wind or seen the sky, except outside my cell window, for 13
   years now," another man, Justin Rueb, [55]says in a National Geographic
   documentary. He later adds, frighteningly: "My thought processes aren't
   quite the same as they used to be. I feel myself wanting to hurt people
   now. Those are never feelings I had before."

   Remember the American hikers who were jailed in Iran? One of them,
   Shane Bauer, visited a solitary cell in the United States to do [56]a
   piece for Mother Jones. In some ways, he wrote, U.S. conditions
   appeared to be worse than what he experienced during four months of
   solitary confinement in Iran.

   "For hours, days, I fixated on the patch of sunlight cast against my
   wall through those barred and grated windows," Bauer wrote of his time
   in Iran. "When, after five weeks, my knees buckled and I fell to the
   ground utterly broken, sobbing and rocking to the beat of my heart, it
   was the patch of sunlight that brought me back. Its slow creeping
   against the wall reminded me that the world did in fact turn and that
   time was something other than the stagnant pool my life was draining
   into.

   "Here, there are no windows."

   These horrors aren't limited to adults.

   I recently spent some time on the phone with Ian Kysel, the Aryeh Neier
   fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union and an author of a
   [57]2012 report on the solitary confinement of minors in jails and
   prisons across the United States.

   "The only thing left to do is go crazy -- just sit and talk to the
   walls," one adolescent in Florida told the researchers. "I catch myself
   (talking to the walls) every now and again. It's starting to become a
   habit because I have nothing else to do. I can't read a book. I work
   out and try to make the best of it. But there is no best."

   Another made up an imaginary friend just to have someone to talk to, he
   said.

   The youngest person he spoke to was 13 at the time of incarceration.
   Some of the kids he interviewed referenced hallucinations, suicidal
   thoughts and self-harm, all driven by the fact that they were so
   utterly and torturously alone under these conditions.

   The U.S. version of solitary started long ago -- with the Quakers,
   surprisingly enough, at Pennsylvania's Eastern State Penitentiary. It
   [58]opened in 1829 and was based on the philosophy that isolating
   inmates gave them a useful opportunity to get closer to God and to
   offer penitence (like "penitentiary," get it?) for their crimes.

   In practice, the prisoners went mad.

   "I hold this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain,
   to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body," [59]Charles
   Dickens wrote in the 1840s after [60]he visited that Philadelphia
   prison, which is [61]now a museum. "And because its ghastly signs and
   tokens are not so palpable to the eye and sense of touch as scars upon
   the flesh; because its wounds are not upon the surface, and it extorts
   few cries that human ears can hear; therefore the more I denounce it,
   as a secret punishment which slumbering humanity is not roused up to
   stay."

   "Secret punishment."

   "Slumbering humanity."

   Some 170 years later, it's time to wake up.

   There are signs that's already happening.

   The Federal Bureau of Prisons has launched a review of its use of
   solitary confinement -- a process a spokesman told me should take about
   a year to complete. (In an e-mailed statement, spokesman Chris Burke
   said some inmates must be isolated to keep prisons safe. "Usually such
   removal continues for only brief periods of time until the disruptive
   inmate can demonstrate his or her ability to refrain from misconduct
   within the institution," he said. "And only a very small subset of the
   population are housed away from the general population at any point in
   time.")

   [62]Florida also is considering legislation to limit the practice for
   minors.

   Mendez, the U.N. special rapporteur, [63]has called solitary
   confinement torture. The practice, he said, should be banned for minors
   and people with mental illness. In rare and extreme cases, he said, it
   should be used for no longer than 15 days.

   Vicky Gunderson, whose son killed himself in solitary, is asking people
   to sign an [64]online petition telling the U.S. attorney general to ban
   solitary confinement for inmates 17 and younger. "He didn't deserve to
   have hope taken away," she said of her son.

   Hers seems like one of the most reasonable requests a still-grieving
   mom could make.

   And it's one we should be hard-pressed to ignore.
