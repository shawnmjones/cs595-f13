A win for voting rights in Ohio (updated)

   Jon Husted, fan of uniformity (now).

   In what [3]Rick Hasen calls "the most important decision in this
   election cycle" and "a major victory for voters' rights," a federal
   court has [4]ruled (pdf) that Ohio must count ballots that are cast in
   the right polling place but at the wrong precinct simply because a
   clerk sent the voter to the wrong place. In 2008, [5]Ohio threw out
   many thousands of provisional ballots cast as a result of that kind of
   mistake.

   "I can't expect 40,000 people who do this job only once or maybe twice
   a year to be perfect," Republican Secretary of State Jon [6]Husted
   told the Cincinnati Enquirer this summer. And yet [7]Husted
   appealed part of an earlier decision requiring Ohio to count the
   votes*, just as he has continued to appeal court rulings allowing for
   early voting on the final weekend and Monday before the election. Less
   than a month from the election, the rules for voting in Ohio remain
   unclear.

   Husted's argument for continuing the fight against expanded early
   voting is that he does not want to end up with different amounts of
   voting in different counties. "The last thing I want to see is a
   non-uniform system where voters will be treated differently in all 88
   counties," [8]he said, though [9]he voted to allow more early voting in
   Republican counties and less in Democratic ones.

   Apparently you can cover a lot of ground by saying you insist on
   uniformity. Earlier this week...
     __________________________________________________________________

   [10]lefty Ohio blog Plunderbund wrote that Husted had quietly forbidden
   elections workers from calling or emailing voters whose absentee
   ballots contained mistakes. Unless those mistakes are corrected, the
   ballots could be thrown out. Husted's order makes it harder to get
   those mistakes fixed, and thus more likely the ballots won't count.

   Today the [11]Cleveland Plain Dealer picked up the story, with an
   explanation from Husted's office:

     "We don't necessarily have an email address or a phone number for
     every voter," [spokesman Matt] McClellan added. "This goes back to
     uniformity around the state."

   One more thing on Husted's plate: Democratic-leaning Lucas County,
   which includes Toledo, has [12]again deadlocked over a plan to offer
   expanded early voting. The tie-breaking vote belongs to the secretary
   of state.

   *UPDATE: Husted had specifically appealed the part of the decision
   requiring that provisional ballots come with a [13]voter's printed name
   and signature. The court today reversed most of that part of the
   ruling, and also ordered more review based on a challenge from
   [14]advocates for the homeless. That leaves the issue still alive. The
   state of Ohio, as a separate intervenor, appealed the order to count
   votes cast in the wrong precinct.

     "We don't necessarily have an email address or a phone number for
     every voter," [spokesman Matt] McClellan added. "This goes back to
     uniformity around the state."

   Guess who's more likely NOT to have an email address? Folks unable to
   afford a computer and an internet connection. Every word he says, every
   move he makes, shows him for what he is, an enemy of democracy, yet I
   don't think he's even embarrassed, let alone ashamed.

   Many Repubs now support MItt and folks like Husted in spite of the fact
   that Mitt, Husted, and their ilk are open liars, subverters of
   democratic values, or walk back their previous ideological positions
   because they're not popular (moderate Mitt in the first debate). That's
   the new base for Mitt, Ryan, and Husted, their new constituency. But if
   this new constituency doesn't agree with their ideas, why support them?
   They must hate Obama so much that they'll support people they don't
   agree with just because they oppose Obama. But why are they Obama
   haters if they have no reason to support Obama's opponents? The only
   reasons I can think of are bad reasons, reasons the new constituency
   won't admit to. It's sad; sad and scary.

   I guess Husted sees himself as that little engine that thought he could
   . . . . From his perspective - I think I can, I think I can, I think I
   can ruin the rights of American citizens by abusing my power as a duly
   elected Secretary of State of the the great state of Ohio!

   Yeah, Mr. Husted, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can condemn
   you to the dust bin of our nation's democratic heritage! Yes, Mr.
   Husted you are a dastardly fellow with no worthy contribution to make,
   but only a sour puss of an effort to corrupt our democracy! -Kevo

   If the Republicans are so confident that the majority of Americans are
   supportive of their ideas why do they put so much effort into denying
   Americans their right to vote? How do they square this with their
   constant chatter about defending the constitution? Hypocrites & dirty
   tricksters with their hands over their hearts ( and their fingers
   crossed ).

   How can they hand the country over to corporate slime and the people

   In criminal matters, the order of the court must be followed during an
   appeal process. Not so in re: the Court order directing that early

   Give the Court time -- Husted didn't inform them of his stay of the
   Court's order until very recently.

   My own guess is that after the previous "misunderstanding" regarding
   the authority of Federal District Judges to give orders to an elected
   official like Mr. Husted, he's going to be ordered to personally
   appear. Again.

   And this time, the Court might not let him out of it if he does a
   "Look! Look! I misunderstood, it's all fixed now!" Could be, one way or
   another, he's going to be having a little face-to-face chat with
   someone who is answerable only to a very short list:
     * His wife
     * The United States Supreme Court
     * Both Houses of Congress acting in concert.

   I find it quite ironic that the Republican party portrays themselves as
   the defenders of the constitution and patriots who represent the
   majority of Americans, and yet do everything in their power to prevent
   Americans from voting, which is our most fundamental right as citizens,
   as well as our way of expressing our opinion as to the best way
   forward. It is my opinion that they are hypocrites and dirty tricksters
   that represent the interests of big business but since that won't fly
   they misrepresent themselves and do their best to distract America from
   noticing

   If any one remembers it was President Ronald Reagan that first
   introduced the idea that when it comes to the economy "government isn't
   the solution, government is the problem". He, I believe, incorrectly
   believed that cutting taxes will force the government to cut spending
   rather that ask congress to cut spending so we can cut taxes. I
   disagree. As much as I distrust the government you have to admit the
   government of the United States has kept the now 50 states in the
   government. What does that mean? We could have ended up as Europe with
   50 different nations struggling individually to grow and prosper or as
   it happened we all joined together to form the most successful country
   in the history of mankind. It was and is the federal government that
   managed to hold everyone together for the betterment of our country as
   a
   whole. So why "Starve the Beast"? The 1% realize that without a
   central clearing house, the government, that money could instead be
   funneled through people, not the government. If the money were to go to
   individuals they would take a percentage making themselves rich but if
   the money flows directly to the government then nobody makes a profit
   except, of course, the government. The government is made up of people
   working for a central organization for the benefit of all. Why weaken
   that? Who builds and maintains the bridges, roads, fixes the potholes,
   and hires the school teacher, fire fighter, or police person?
   Individuals will, if it benefits them, but the government does it
   because it benefits all. Ideally the government will dispense the money
   evenly where it will do the most good. But if individuals have the
   money it will benefit themselves. So, as much as I hate to say it, we
   need a strong federal government to hold our country into one and not
   fifty different ones.

   well said. also consider that our operating environment is one of
   "gathering" - tto get more to have more - without end. without
   constraint. without limit. without end. think on that. it is the
   current scenario's method to own everything. consider the future where
   children are born into a world where everything is owned by a few.
   because if we dont stop the madness, thats where we end up.

   repubes want to make you- the individual- subordinate to their will.
   they want to steal from you the protections of life, liberty & pursuit
   of happiness guaranteed you - the individual - by the BillOfRgiths &
   Constitution of the U.S. of America. They want to deprive you of
   religious freedom by forcing laws upon you with their own talibanstyle
   authoritarianism which radical extremists we are currently fighting in
   afganistan. They want to subordinate you and your life to their
   monopolistic style business practices and place the so-called people
   corporations ahead of you - the individual - and your life.
   Essentially, the repubes want you to obey their commands at your
   expense of life and liberty in violation of the Consitution of the
   United States of America. And, they want the supreme court to uphold
   republican radical extremism. Thats what this election is all about.

   this whole steal the election effort of the anti-america repuber

   their mindset is "rule or be ruled" - its a dictatorial paranoia, an

   No, one cannot expect "40,000 people who do this job only once or maybe
   twice a year to be perfect,"; that's true. But, in all fairness (we do
   want to be fair, don't we, Mr Husted?), one cannot expect the voters
   (possibly more than 40 thousand of them) to be punished for those
   imperfections; to just grin and bear being deprived of one's rights.
   Can we, Mr Husted?

   A while back, the Tea Party said that it was time to water the tree of
   liberty with the blood of tyrants.

   Is the Tea Party right?

   For the past four years, we have seen a dramatic growth of "big
   government" tyranny in this country. We have seen numerous laws passed
   by government extremists. And, we have seen these government extremists
   turn our democratic process into a state of anarchy.

   We have seen new laws that eliminate the rights of workers in the
   workplace.

   We have seen efforts to pass laws to allow employers to impose their
   "religious" beliefs on their employees, and thus eliminate the rights
   of employees to make decisions about their personal lives.

   We have seen efforts to pass laws designed to turn our democracy into a
   plutocracy.

   And, we have seen new laws designed to prevent millions of Americans
   from voting.

   Is the Tea Party right? Is it time to eliminate Tyranny, Extremism, and
   Anarchy?

   What I don't understand is the everyday person on the street who are
   republicans. Why aren't they standing against their republican
   conterparts? They don't understand history very well if they think that
   the powers that be aren't coming for them next! Right now they need the
   help of these republicans to defeat the Democrat Party, but when they
   are finished with us there will be no stopping Corporate America. We
   have all watched what has been happening over the past few decades.
   There has been a concerted effort to break the backs of the Middle
   Class, starting with their republican hero, Ronald Reagan. I'm not sure
   how to reach the solution we need, but I do know that the people of
   this country need to stand together - Neighbor with neighbor if we want
   to take our country back. Since Ronald Reagan, Corporate America has
   succeeded in dividing us along social lines. We're to the point where
   Democrats and Republicans can't even have a civil conversation with one
   another. That has been the plan all along. Now they are taking our
   votes across the country. In Texas they are starting to require RFID's
   in the schools! CEO's are threatening to fire workers if they don't
   vote the way required. If we don't learn to come together they will
   win! I know I sound like some radical - but really, I'm not. I'm a 60
   year old disabled woman who fears for her country and the people in it!
   We used to stand for something better!

   I'm thinking Husted may be shooting his fellow Republicans in the foot
   with his mission against early voting. Poll analysers Nate Silver and
   Sam Wang are calling Romney's post-debate surge in the polls a "bounce"
   caused by Republican enthusiasm. Given time, this will probably wane,
   so wouldn't it be in the best interests of Republicans to allow Ohioans
   to vote early?
