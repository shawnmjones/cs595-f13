   The latest Republican freakout:
   [30][478315adc450a5b7cb8a035d6fe80f02_normal.jpeg] RT @gopconference:
   Clutch with his brackets. Late with his budgets. Check out our new
   video -- [31]http://t.co/... #BalancedBudget
   -- [32]@SpeakerBoehner via web

   Of course, he follows up an hour later with this:

   #balancedbudget stacks up against Dems' tax & spend plan that never
   balances [34]http://t.co/...

   So is there a budget or is there not a budget? But ... brackets!

   [46][d1473bfbdc85ea92cd8d1b8776eca898_normal.jpeg] While the President
   can turn in his NCAA bracket on time each year, this is his fourth
   budget out five that is late since he took office.
   -- [47]@GOPWhip via [48]TweetDeck

   A little lesson in how our system works--spending bills originate in
   the House, not the White House. So this talk about "White House
   budgets" is nonsense from the beginning. Those "budgets" don't have the
   force of law. They are just blueprints for negotiations over actual
   appropriations bills. And remember, those are Constitutionally tasked
   to the House.

   In short, this is their way to try and get Obama to own entitlement
   cuts that they themselves are pushing for. The White House doesn't need
   to fall for that nonsense.

   But aside from the idiocy, here is the GOP once again proving they are
   divorced from the rest of the American people. I mean, listen to what
   Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus [49]said this
   morning:

     [O]ur party has divorced itself from the American culture ... [We]
     would make fun of the president for going on 'The View' -- and
     you've heard me say these things -- ... you know, talking hoops for
     half an hour on ESPN. That's where a lot of America is at, and I
     think we've got to get with it ...

   Sorry, Reince. Boehner and your merry band of wingnuts ignored your
   memo. And yes, as a result, the Republicans look like assholes while
   the rest of March Madness-obsessed America compares their brackets to
   the president's.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [68]Tagging tips - [69]Search For Tags - [70]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [71]Civil
   Rights, [72]Community, [73]Congress, [74]Culture, [75]Economy,
   [76]Education, [77]Elections, [78]Energy, [79]Environment, [80]Health
   Care, [81]International, [82]Labor, [83]Law, [84]Media, [85]Meta,
   [86]National Security, [87]Science, [88]Transportation, or [89]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([90]California, [91]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       ... Republican positions inevitably fall back to "Well, it's an
       opening negotiating position."  Odd, isn't it, that they're not
       willing to look at the Progressive Caucus' budget in the same way?
        If Republicans can put out their fantasy wish list, why can't
       Democrats?
       I would never expect the president to support the Progressive
       budget, but why can't he just say he supports the Senate Democrats'
       effort and tell Boehner to go do his job?

       The Progressive Budget is actually a sane offering. Let us not
       engage in false equivalencies.
       As to your assertion about a wish list, yes, why don't we have an
       extreme wish list so that the Progressive Budget looks modest? Why?

 Yes, it's a sane offering ([300]0+ / 0-)
       ... but in the world of the Beltway its tax hikes on the very
       wealthy and big stimulus programs are about as unlikely to happen
       as Ryan's voucherizing Medicare.  So in that sense, yes, they are
       equivalent as beginning negotiating positions.  Assuming any
       good-faith negotiations were ever going to happen, which I do not.

        Recommended by:

       there is always a hilarious, cleverly edited mockup of Republican
       talking points on the Daily Show the day after a media flurry.
       But the annoying thing is, it probably works: not everyone has the
       time to comb through the blogosphere and discover the tightly
       choreographed release of the latest Republican meme. So they're
       sent out there, and for all that people know, the Republicans are
       just a highly unified party in which everyone is on the same page
       and has a shared sense of purpose. In the meantime, now everyone
       immediately has a little soundbite to hang onto.
       I'm not sure whether Democrats have improved on this of late; the
       fact that I'm not sure is perhaps telling. Certainly, Republicans
       have historically been better at message coordination (though
       they're faced with the problem that their message objectively
       sucks).

       That's one of the things that's confounded Democrats for years, and
       it's because of the ideological diversity of the party. It runs
       from conservative to left-libertarian, while in the Republican
       party there's been an almost systematic purge of everyone to the
       left of, say, Jon Huntsman.
       Do note that the Republican positions, at their base, are
       essentially forms of "No." And "No" is always the easiest, safest
       position for a politician to take because it requires nothing, not
       even any advocacy. It's the easiest possible vote to take, doing
       nothing. And therefore it follows that it's the easiest message to
       carry forward and distribute. "Just say no." "No Obamacare!"
       "Nobama!" "No 'illegals!'" "No affirmative action!"
       Any position advanced from liberals is generally of a constructive
       bent, thus it must be advocated for. People who wish to say "no" to
       things have the much easier row to hoe in that regard. It's easier
       to convince people to say 'no' than it is to say 'yes.' It's also
       easier to appeal to our baser, hurtful instincts than it is to
       appeal to a social spirit.
       And this site, even as it's purportedly to the left of the liberal
       mainstream in the Democratic Party (though many people here do not
       support Democrats), you will find incredible diversity of opinion.

       Yup, that's certainly very true.
       I agree with your big tent assessment. One thing I would also
       suggest, which is perhaps more of a stereotype, is the notion that
       Republicans are temperamentally predisposed towards good message
       discipline and coordination: it's much easier for many of them to
       imagine subordinating their personal opinion to the group hivemind,
       to become dutiful foot soldiers. This is what the Christian Right
       has done for years, as they've patiently waited for their more
       cynical, fiscally motivated Republican political representatives to
       implement the theocratic dystopia that they've long sought.
       And, as Michael Moore has ruefully pointed out, these guys are
       highly motivated: they get up especially early in the morning to
       figure out how they're going to screw someone today. Not all of our
       Democratic constituents have their stuff so firmly together.

   I believe the GOP is leaping on this because to them liking NCAA means
   liking basketball, and saying this president is more focused on
   basketball is a not-so-subtle racial dog whistle. The GOP is out of
   touch, we all know this. In their world basketball = black man sport.

       popularity of the NBA is showing its wider appeal. The tones on

     If stereotypes held true, you would think that the Republicans would
     be the ones telling folks to turn that blasted music down. But this
     year -- and indeed in many past election cycles -- it's the GOP that
     has been attracting cease-and-desist letters for pilfering music
     against the artists' wishes. So let's take a look at some of the
     more notable GOP music fails from this cycle, and cycles past.

     Senate candidate Chuck DeVore (R-CA) got burned for using for using
     altered-lyric version of Don Henley's "The Boys of Summer" and "All
     She Wants To Do Is Dance" for his campaign's Web ads. David Byrne is
     suing Gov. Charlie Crist (I-FL) for using "Road To Nowhere" in a Web
     ad during his previous Republican Senate primary fight, and of
     course, as we reported yesterday, Rush cut to the chase and told
     Senate nominee Rand Paul (R-KY) to stop playing "Tom Sawyer" and
     "The Spirit of Radio."

     The Orleans song "Still The One" has a special place in politics as
     it has been used not once without the band's permission, but twice
     -- and the first instance contributed to its author's entrance into
     national politics. In 2004, the Bush campaign used the song at a
     rally. As the song's main author, John Hall, told MSNBC in 2008:
     "George Bush was busy campaigning on an `ownership society,' yet
     never asked me, the band, or the publishers for permission." Hall
     and other stakeholders in the song quickly sent a cease-and-desist
     letter, and the Bush campaign dropped the song.

   Further not setting HIS priorities and principles out may be good
   "politics' but it is not leadership. He doesn't HAVE to own entitlement

       sequester amounts to be taken into account in the FY 2014

       Given that the BCA 2011 (as extended) gives the Administration
       until March 21 to figure out all the details by account, the very
       soonest the Administration could get the FY 2014 Budget out is the
       first week of April.  And that would be a very tight timeframe,
       given all the changes that were made at the last minute in the
       sequester.
       They do not have a right to mock him on the budget since the very
       law they passed required him to take the sequester into account--a
       sequester that changed on March 1, 2013.
       What can be mocked is that for the umpteenth year in a row,

       Congress is not talking about passing the individual FY 2013
       appropriations bills, instead they're working on another Continuing
       Resolution, which will run for the remaining six months of this
       fiscal year.
       Which means Congress will have totally failed to do what they are
       required to do by law. Instead we will have an Omnibus Spending
       Bill, and who knows what nonsense will be loaded into it. Sigh.
       There is no excuse for this -- each agency's administrative staff
       spends several months every year producing their budget requests.
       Those are turned in to the President's office sometime in December,
       so there is time to compile the budget the President sends to
       Congress.
       It is very hard to prepare these when the financial situation is in

   As Kate above states quite nicely, the WH does indeed produce a budget
   proposal every year - except for this one.

   They simply do not want to put anything down on paper.  They would
   rather put the President out in campaign mode with vague wishes and
   goals that cannot be fact checked.  The American people are only going
   to put up with this for so long.  And Obama can hardly criticize the

 Bullshit -- the budget requests from the Federal ([765]0+ / 0-)

   agencies are a matter of public record (check with the Office of

   What that means is that EVERY agency had to produce two budgets this
   time, one with and one without the sequester effects.

   The administrative officers responsible for producing each department's
   budget requests do not have the liberty of waiting for the Congress to
   do its damned job. And you'd better believe that the figures for the

       It's their one and only hobby. They need to branch out. Perhaps hit
       the gym or take up running.

 House gives Executive Branch Power of the Purse. ([800]0+ / 0-)

   My thought on this is simple... If the House doesn't want to do budgets
   anymore then perhaps we could make it official and just let the
   Executive Branch take care of he "purse strings" from now on. Who needs
   a room full of noisy old white men screaming for their district to get
   a new highway or bridge built with their name on it? I guess since they
   just cannot do the job then let the Executive Branch do it for a while.

   This would mean that the House only can vote yes or no on the Budget as
   a whole and then the Senate can put in their changes and send it back
   to the Executive for signature since the House doesn't want to do
   anything else. LOL!

 These idjits are like the kid who cheated ([803]0+ / 0-)

   off my test answers in grade school and then blamed me for his wrong
   answers.  They don't want to do the work they're supposed to do and
   then blame the President for not doing their work?
   BTW, I went back over my test and corrected the answers I knew were
   wrong before handing it in.  Jerk never cheated off me again!

   from Obama.  [807]Kid President has more respect for us Bruins.  :-P

 Jealous much GOP? ([811]0+ / 0-)

   The President can walk and chew gum at the same time.

   Also, Who would like like to have a beer with while watching March
   Madness ? Well, it is NOT Boehner or Priebus as they would interrupt
   the game with their crazy-talk.

 Glad someone said it. The budget is the House's ([814]0+ / 0-)

   job.  They need to do their job, work with the Senate so the President
   has something to sign.  Instead of reading choice pieces of the
   Constitution they should have watched Schoolhouse Rocks and figured
   about how a bill becomes a law.
