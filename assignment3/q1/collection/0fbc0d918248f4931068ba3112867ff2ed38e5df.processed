   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [43]Tagging tips - [44]Search For Tags - [45]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [46]Civil
   Rights, [47]Community, [48]Congress, [49]Culture, [50]Economy,
   [51]Education, [52]Elections, [53]Energy, [54]Environment, [55]Health
   Care, [56]International, [57]Labor, [58]Law, [59]Media, [60]Meta,
   [61]National Security, [62]Science, [63]Transportation, or [64]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([65]California, [66]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       i got to see and hear her sing and play piano for a small group
       during the Boston Convention.   she waved and smiled at me and
       we've been BFF ever since.  okay, maybe the last part of that
       sentence isn't exactly true, but the first part of the sentence is.

       go Carole.  you've got a lotta friends.

 Carole King is a true living legend ([90]4+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:

       No one can begin to top her body of work that spanned five decades
       and so many genres.  I checked her bio to find out when she
       released Tapestry which was one of the all time greatest selling
       albums in history and I was shocked to see that she is 71!  She
       sure does not look it. It is hard to believe that Tapestry was
       released over 40 years ago and it still has staying power.  Carole
       King is indeed very cool and Ed Markey is a lucky guy to have her
       support.  The ad is very genuine and effective.

   He said the government is spying on us. That wasn't the crime.
   The crime was that he had proof. That, in their eyes, is unforgivable.

 His own testimony broke no laws ([148]0+ / 0-)
       and he stayed in the US - on Nixon's enemies list. Even after
       Colson led untrue person attacks on him when he ran for Congress,
       he stayed in this country.
       At this point, Snowden - by where he has gone - likely has taken US
       classified material, which he can not secure, to countries that
       want them.
       Snowden could have accomplished the goal many ascribe to him of
       exposing the scope of meta data collected without breaking his
       promise not to compromise the classified data he had access to.
       It may seem CT, but it seems that this is an effort to harm Obama
       and the Democratic party and to get more Rand Paul libertarians in
       office by peeling off the far left from the Democrats.

   opposite of MA-SEN 2010.

   A lot of it is the political climate. But Markey campaigned well, the
   state party was involved early, and so was the national party, sending
   the Obamas and Bill Clinton to the state early, instead of waiting.
