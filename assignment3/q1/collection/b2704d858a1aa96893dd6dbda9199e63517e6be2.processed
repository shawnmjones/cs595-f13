Arizona police: 4-year-old boy fatally shoots his father

   By Todd Sperry, CNN

   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Father, boy were visiting Prescott Valley, Arizona
     * Former roommate did not know they were coming
     * Boy, 4, picked up handgun, opened fire
     * Dad is fatally wounded in accident

   (CNN) -- A man was fatally wounded when his 4-year-old son fired a gun
   he found while they were visiting a residence in Prescott Valley,
   Arizona, officials said.

   Justin Stanfield Thomas, 35, and his son made an unannounced trip
   Friday to the home of an unidentified former roommate, police said.
   Thomas had previously lived in the residence, according to
   investigators.

   "This appears to be an accident. There was no conflict in the stories
   of those in the house," said Prescott Valley Police Sgt. Brandon
   Bonney. "The resident didn't know his former roommate was stopping by
   to visit."

   Moments after arriving at the home, the boy picked up the small-caliber
   handgun and asked his father and other adults in the room what it was
   he was holding, said Bonney.

   Seconds later he pulled the trigger.

   Officers and emergency crews arrived and found Thomas, of Phoenix, with
   a single gunshot wound to the chest. He was transported to a local
   hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

   [42]Kids and guns: 'These are not isolated tragedies'

   Acknowledging it appears to have been a tragic accident, Bonney
   cautioned gun owners

   "We want to remind people without making a villain of this person, that
   if a child is visiting your home, the first thing to do would be put
   the firearm away."

   No charges were anticipated because the incident was an accident,
   Bonney told CNN.
