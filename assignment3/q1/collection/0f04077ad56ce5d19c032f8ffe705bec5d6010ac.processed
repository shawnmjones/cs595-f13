   Daily Kos Radio's Kagro in the Morning show podcasts are now available
   through iTunes.

   There's a new pope! But that's all I have to say about that guy.

   When I was a kid, I'd never heard of the pope until Paul VI died and
   they elected John Paul I. And then after that, I thought they must
   elect popes every couple of weeks.

   I looked through Wikipedia last night to read about the various popes,
   and was vastly entertained. Did you know they used to look and dress
   like Santa Claus? What a great idea! I wonder why they stopped doing
   that? Turns out the last pope actually brought that stuff back,
   briefly. And there are special names for those things, too. Not "Funky
   Santa Claus-looking pope duds," either. The Santa-looking hat is called
   a camauro. Not a Camaro, which would surely make a bitchin' Popemobile,
   but a camauro. And the Santa cape is the winter mozzetta. They've
   definitely got to keep that stuff in the rotation. And the Santa beards
   could stand to make a comeback, too.

   Here's what else I learned about Popes Benedict. The ugliest pope I
   could find: Benedict XIII. Only guy I found who was pope three times:
   Benedict IX. Also, he was gay. So there's that.

   Well, what did you think we were going to talk about? The budget?

   We're LIVE at 9 a.m. ET with Kagro in the Morning, thanks to
   NetrootsRadio.com.

   We've been having some chronic problems with the phone-in system, and

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [53]Tagging tips - [54]Search For Tags - [55]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   Are you sure you want to remove this diary from your hotlist?
   Are you sure you want to remove your recommendation? You can only
   recommend a diary once, so you will not be able to re-recommend it
   afterwards.
   Rescue this diary, and add a note:

 but the quoter actually not a bad guy ([93]0+ / 0-)

     About 75 doctors from across the state attended a meeting at the
     Statehouse.

     Rep. Kris Crawford, a Republican from Florence and also an emergency
     room doctor, supports the expansion but expects the Republican
     caucus to vote as a block against the Medicaid expansion.
     "The politics are going to overwhelm the policy. It is good politics
     to oppose the black guy in the White House right now, especially for
     the Republican Party," Crawford said.
     He encouraged the doctors to advocate the use of the budget to
     accomplish expansion of Medicaid, rather than passing additional
     laws.
