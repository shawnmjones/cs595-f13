   ANAHEIM, CA--Claiming that thousands of innocent lives had been saved,
   authorities announced today that a plot to bomb the Honda Center was
   successfully foiled Thursday evening after a concert security worker
   lightly tapped a purse with his hands, revealing several hidden
   explosives. "I grazed the outside of her bag with my fingers for a
   split second, and I could immediately feel the IEDs in there," said
   Anthony Corvine, the heroic 31-year-old security staffer who identified
   the threat while manning the arena's bag-check line. "We're specially
   trained for this sort of thing, so a brief touch of any purse or
   backpack and we'll know exactly what's in there. People say I'm a hero,
   but I was just following our standard, highly effective purse-tapping
   protocol." Sources confirmed this is the second such terrorist plot
   recently foiled at a major stadium, after security at New York City's
   Barclays Center quickly patted the front pockets of an attempted
   suicide bomber last month.
