   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [52]Tagging tips - [53]Search For Tags - [54]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   I'd like someone to comment on all the right-wing outrage over the
   original leaks that probably led to some of the steps taken to identify
   the leaks.  I guess the wingers actually do  play a mean game of
   11-dimensional chess:  get outraged over leaks, then get outraged over
   the steps taken to identify the leaks.  A win-win!

   Oh, and no, I don't like these measures taken by the justice dept..
   Frankly, thought, I think it would be funny if it turns out that some
   Republican Congresscritter was the one leaking.

       So long as the parties are able to play us like patsies, we must
       lose.
       Right now it's ---
       "But those damned fascist racist Republicans are worse."
       or
       "But those damned commie baby-killing Democrats are evil."
       Nobody ever actually has to be good.  They just have to not be the
       other guy.
       I'm not sure there's a way out of it.  My desperation voting
       strategy has become:
       1.  Is there somebody running I actually like (sometimes, but
       usually not).
       2.  Is there somebody running so scary that I'd rather see Satan in
       the seat?  That's almost never the case, but it can happen.
       If answers to 1 and 2 or no, vote against whoever's in the seat
       now.  Open seat? Vote against the party currently in the White
       House or vote with a mind to keeping one party from controlling
       White House and both Houses of Congress.
       Not especially sophisticated and not especially laudable, but it's
       easy to apply.

       Dems are almost always slightly less sucky than Republicans. I will
       probably keep voting for them. But I do not donate to Democrats
       anymore. I feel that it is a more effective progressive use of my
       money to spend a little more buying stuff from local farmers and
       businesses in order to withhold support from big corporations.
       That's my activism. I'm done donating and volunteering for Wall
       Street Democrats like Obama and... well, just about all of them
       except maybe Alan Grayson.

 Glad you like it. We all need to find our coping ([225]0+ / 0-)
       strategies.
       I'm waiting for another year like 1992 when Ross Perot ran.
       After going down to Clinton HQ in Chicago to volunteer for his
       campaign, I actually ended up putting in a lot of hours for Perot.
       He was a mixed bag in a lot of ways -- but, let's see:
       1. Shrinking the deficit -- at a time when the economy could
       support it -- that was his biggest issue.
       2. A $.50 per gallon gas tax? He was all over it. At today's
       prices, that would be more like a dollar, but...funny how Democrats
       didn't jump all over it.
       3. When Clinton and Gore were talking up NAFTA? Perot accurately
       and memorably describe the giant sucking sounds as jobs left the
       country.
       The 19% of the popular vote he won had a lot to do with Bill
       Clinton's actions after the 1994 midterm setback.
       Or -- for that matter -- the Civil Rights movements courting of
       Democrats over the years.  A minority of voters capable of tipping
       the election.
       We don't need somebody to win so much as somebody who can be
       identified with an important issue that enough people will vote for
       to constitute an identifiable and winnable block of votes.  Ain't
       sexy, just old-fashioned coalition-ish politics, but we can't even
       seem to manage that these days.

       Years ago I stopped identifying as a "liberal" because I realized
       that there was too much truth to the gibe that "being a liberal
       means always having to say you're sorry." Only, the ones to whom
       liberals seem to be saying "sorry" most often are the ones on the
       right. I avoid "isms" and identify as a self-respecting
       non-conservative. That's not short and snappy, but it's where I am.
       Also, I realized long ago that many people who say they are not
       conservatives are actually right-wingers by another name, e.g., the
       Paulistas. And anarchists? It is to laugh! All that being said, it
       is completely clear, as far as I'm concerned, that the Republicans
       and others on the right are far and away the most dangerous
       political elements in American Society. Dissatisfaction with the
       Democratic Party must not blind us to the unpleasant reality that
       the most immediate and present danger to the US comes from the
       Republicans and their fellow-travelers.

   The only reason they fight any of those at all is because it's a Dem
   doing them at the moment.  Get a Republican in the WH again, and you'll
   not hear a peep against any of those.

 I wish Dems were blameless ([293]0+ / 0-)
       But there has been a deafening lack of noise about Obama's failures
       on personal privacy.  Wyden and Sanders and a few colleagues have
       been consistent, and maybe Elizabeth Warren, but too many Dems have
       been eager to defend something they would have excoriated the
       previous misadministration for.

   The global corporate press' practice of journalism has indeed been
   contrary to all interests of the United States.

   We have a corporate state and a corporate press, so most of the time,
   the corporate press is the same as a state press.

   When it practices investigative journalism it's not on behalf of the
   people but on behalf of state factions against other state factions.
   Our system does not provide for informing the people or hosting

   I get it: "The legislative branch has abdicated, and no executive in
   his right mind would give up power when the legislature keeps trying to
   shovel it into his lap." There are still courts, even if there are no
   judges and no one asks the prospective judges how they feel about

   Recommended by:

   that this was started under the PATRIOT act.  Does anyone seriously
   believe the FBI stopped developing their intrusion capabilities with
   the Carnivore program, or the NSA, CIA, DoD and the other acronyms?
   Also, it's been clear that until recently the President has had little
   motivation to reduce the invasion of privacy powers garnered by Bush
   II.  I'm just surprised that there's actual public attention and
   surprise on this subject.
   Final point, the main question I have is this an element of Obama's
   long term strategy or are these brouhahas actual distractions?  Is he
   actually exposing his liberal self and allowing this commotion to fix
   some of the overreach, or is he just trying to contain another PR
   problem.

       the correct beginning of the end is not USA-PATRIOT but rahter the
       Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which legalized most
       of Richard Nixon's wrongdoings.
       Of course, I suppose you could also cite such goodies as Woodrow
       Wilson's Espionage and Sedition Acts, and John Adam's Alien and
       Sedition Acts, but these were admittedly before my time.
