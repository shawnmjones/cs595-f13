Fort Hood shooting jury recommends death penalty for Nidal Hasan

   By Bill Mears, CNN
   updated 7:02 AM EDT, Thu August 29, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Staff sergeant who was shot seven times wants sentence carried
       out as soon as possible
     * 13-member panel deliberates for almost two hours before
       recommending death
     * The convening authority -- a general -- has the option of reducing
       the sentence
     * He has admitted being the gunman who left 13 dead, 32 wounded in
       2009 massacre

   Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- A military jury on Wednesday recommended the
   death penalty for convicted Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan, for the
   2009 massacre on post that left 13 people dead and 32 others wounded.

   The 13-member panel spent less than two hours deliberating privately,
   and the president -- or forewoman-- announced the finding in open court
   with a clear voice, that Hasan "be put to death."

   The convicted killer said nothing as the decision was announced, and
   had appeared emotionless earlier in the morning when dramatic closing
   arguments in the sentencing phase were held without his participation.
   Victim 'happy' with Hasan's sentence

   Hasan serves as his own attorney and his refusal to mount a vigorous
   defense, or to offer any mitigating evidence to blunt a capital
   sentence, may have made the panel's unanimous decision less complicated
   or agonizing.
   Witness: Hasan death penalty 'wonderful'

   The judge quickly accepted the verdict; the matter now goes to the
   "convening authority" -- an Army general who will review the four-week
   court-martial proceedings and make the binding decision whether to
   accept the guilty verdict and capital sentence.

   It is a process that could take a few more months, and only then will
   the verdicts become official.

   The convening authority has the option of reducing the sentence to life
   in prison without parole. The defendant will then have the right to
   appeal through the military justice system.

   [41]Fort Hood shooting timeline

   The Army psychiatrist will at some point be transferred to military
   death row in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to join five other condemned
   prisoners. The president of the United States would sign any death
   warrant, and the execution would take place at a federal correctional
   facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.

   The American-born man of Palestinian descent turned and looked at the
   panel president as she read the sentence, then moved to face the judge.
   There was no reaction from him.

   There were also no outbursts from family members gathered in the
   courtroom. Some held hands, and brief embraces and smiles followed the
   announcement.

   Family of two of the victims addressed reporters a few hundred yards
   from the courthouse.

   "Nidal Hasan is a coward and an unrepentant murderer," said Gale Hunt,
   mother of Jason "JD" Hunt. She urged the public now to focus on the
   wounded and the victim families, including the memory of her son. "He
   was a very kind and thoughtful person," she said.

   "The best thing for that man is to be forgotten," said Kerry Cahill,
   daughter of Michael Cahill, 62, the only civilian killed in the
   attacks. Kerry said many of the family members had met over the weekend
   as the court-martial drew to a close, sharing their memories and
   emotional pain with one another. "We are a family," she said.

   Army Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford, who survived the attack despite being
   shot seven times, said on CNN's "Piers Morgan Live" Wednesday night
   that he wants to see the sentence carried out as soon as possible.

   "I definitely do not want him to just sit and wait and die of old age,"
   said Lunsford, who testified at the trial.

   Lunsford said post-traumatic stress syndrome has been the worst of his
   injuries, leaving him always on high alert even around his family.

   "My kids cannot come up behind me and just say, 'Dad, I love you,"
   without announcing themselves," Lunsford said. If his wife tries to
   console him when he has nightmares, "I will physically kick her out of
   bed or I will fight back."

   The sentencing ends a nearly four-year legal process that strained the
   emotions of survivors and family members of the victims.

   They spoke on the bench earlier in the week during the sentencing
   phase, describing their grief and loss. An Army prosecutor earlier
   Wednesday summarized the case, offering personal vignettes of all 13
   victims killed and urging the panel to ignore Hasan's earlier statement
   that he was willing to die in custody as a "martyr" for his faith.

   "He will never be a martyr, because he has nothing to give," Col.
   Michael Mulligan said in an even voice. "He is a criminal, a
   cold-blooded murderer. He is not giving his life; we are taking his
   life."

   "You should not punish him for his religion, you should punish him for
   his crimes," he added.

   Inside the courtroom, widows and mothers wiped tears from their eyes
   throughout the oral presentation. Hasan remained stoic as usual,
   looking mainly at photos of victims on his monitor screen during
   closing, occasionally glancing at Mulligan addressing the panel.

   He stroked his beard and wiped his nose repeatedly with a tissue.

   'He only dealt in death'

   Outside of brief comments at the beginning of the court-martial four
   weeks ago, where he admitted being the lone gunman, the defendant has
   not put on much of a case.

   That left the government alone Wednesday to summarize the incident and
   the impact on the survivors, families of victims, and Fort Hood
   community.

   "Death. He was trained as doctor to save lives, but on 5 November 2009,
   he only dealt in death," Mulligan said. The prosecutor tied the
   narrative together with a unifying theme: the separate teams of two
   officers in Class-A uniforms who knocked on the doors of the victim's
   families across the country to deliver the sad news.

   Mulligan also recounted graphic details of the carnage inside Station
   13, Room 42003 of the medical readiness center, where the victims were
   preparing for their military deployments overseas.

   Lt. Col. Juanita Warman, 55, was shot four times and, from her nursing
   training, knew she was dying from internal bleeding. "She had just a
   few minutes to pass on one final message: 'Tell my family I love them.'
   "

   For the widow of Spc. Jason Hunt, the subsequent emotional pain has
   been tough. "Grief is a personal emotion," Mulligan said. "Hers led her
   to the depths of suicide and back." Jennifer Hunt told the panel Monday
   she is raising her three children alone.

   Hasan had indicated he wanted his service record, his lack of a
   previous criminal record and his psychological evaluations kept under
   wraps. Speaking in a clear voice from his wheelchair, Hasan dismissed
   the ex parte actions by his "overzealous defense counsel."

   After weeks of mostly silence in his defense, Hasan had little more to
   say this week in the capital sentencing phase of his court-martial,
   telling the jury panel Tuesday three short words: "The defense rests."

   [42]Fort Hood shooting family members testify

   His brief remarks produced a gasp in the courtroom.

   The panel of senior officers last week convicted the defendant on all
   counts of premeditated murder from the incident at the deployment
   processing center on this sprawling U.S. Army base. Hasan was wounded
   in the attacks and remains a paraplegic.

   The defendant called no witnesses and presented no documentary evidence
   on why he should not die for his crimes. He also offered no explanation
   for his refusal to mount any defense in either the trial or sentencing
   phases. Judge Tara Osborn, an Army colonel, reluctantly granted his
   wishes, again telling Hasan, "You're the captain of your own ship."

   Appeals could take years

   If swift justice is the goal, history may not be on Hasan's or the
   government's side. The last military execution was in 1961, and only
   five servicemen face lethal injection. Three are African-American, two
   are white.

   The mandatory appellate process could take years, even if Hasan
   voluntarily foregoes many of the procedural steps available to any
   defense.

   [43]Fort Hood victims feel betrayed

   President George W. Bush signed a death warrant in 2008 for Ronald
   Gray, a former Army specialist convicted in the military system of
   several spree killings. His scheduled execution was stayed, and the
   case remains under appeal.

   The military has its own legal standards and procedures when trying and
   appealing capital cases. The U.S. Supreme Court gets the final say, if
   any petition reaches that far. Of the 11 military death sentences that
   have completed direct appeal, nine (82%) have been reversed.

   Some military law experts say multiple victims play a key role in
   whether service personnel are prosecuted for capital crimes. Army Staff
   Sgt. Robert Bales pleaded guilty last month to killing 16 Afghan
   civilians in Kandahar in 2012, thereby avoiding the death penalty.

   Procedures were revised significantly in 1984 after a military appeals
   court concluded application of the death penalty in that venue was
   unconstitutional. That led to even fewer capital cases moving forward.

   Some Fort Hood victim family members believe justice someday will be
   served.

   "He will pay for what he did," said Jerri Krueger, mother of Sgt. Amy
   Krueger, 29, gunned down as she tried to crawl away from the barrage of
   gunfire at the processing center.

   The Hasan prosecution noted the heroism of three victims, whose despite
   their wounds, tried to charge the gunman. Cahill was shot six times but
   managed to fling a chair at Hasan before succumbing. Capt. John
   Gaffaney, 54, and Spc. Frederick Greene, 29, also were cited.

   Greene was shot a dozen times, more than any victim. "What infuriated
   his murderer so much that he nearly emptied half his clip" on one
   soldier, Mulligan said. "He died in dynamic engagement."

   Greene left behind a wife and two daughters.
