   There are pros and cons in storm chasing. On the pro side we have
   learned a lot about storms thanks to the practice of chasing them. On
   the con side, these storms can kill no matter how experienced or
   cautious the [30]chaser may be:

     Being around any tornado is insanely dangerous, and the one in El
     Reno on May 31 was a monster among monsters: its funnel was 2.6
     miles across, the widest ever documented in the U.S., and radar
     clocked its wind speeds a few hundred feet above the ground at 296
     miles per hour ... Unfortunately, no amount of experience might have
     made a difference in a direct confrontation with a storm this
     powerful and erratic. Other storm chasers on the scene who got too
     close saw their cars battered catastrophically. A car holding Mark
     Bettes of The Weather Channel and other passengers was thrown 200
     yard. The SRV Dominator 2, an 8,000-lb. storm-chasing vehicle
     armored against tornado damage by storm chaser Reed Timmer, had its
     hood torn off.

     education to health care, in order to rescue the Defense Department
     and other politically favored agencies from the ravages of

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Smart prof would quietly interview candidates... ([209]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [210]belinda ridgewood, [211]RiveroftheWest

   ...and just as quietly, see to it that those selected were on the
   relatively leaner side, framing his reasons for picking those
   candidates over others entirely on non-weighty grounds.  This is how
   smart people have implemented their biases for ages without leaving
   tracks for anyone to criticize or sue them; it would be more difficult
   (both on legal and evidentiary grounds to build a viable statistical
   case against a prof selecting relatively leaner grad students than it
   would if he was selecting on racial bias.

   I'm not advocating discrimination based on weight here, but rather
   simply noting the sheer stupidity of this supposedly smart professor in
   running such an arrogant, undisciplined mouth.  This prof sounds as if
   he was trying to provoke controversy.

   I not a necessary condition for becoming a professor unless on it at a
   community college or other such thing.  Writing grants to cover part or
   all of your budget is.  One is also judged on getting students through
   their thesis.

   It is also notable that this is coming from a psychologist and not
   anyone with a hard science background.  Such 'scientists' seem much
   more able to make a career on specious conclusions and innuendo.
   Recall The Bell Curve?  We see this in the use of the word
   'carbohydrate.'  While is true than any nutrient that is processed and
   then added to food above it's natural levels is to significant is not
   indicated for good health, this idea that we don't need indicated
   portions of nutrients, be it carbohydrates, fat, protein, is not
   supported by any evidence.

   It mostly has to with opinion and chauvinism.  Like the idea that a
   primitive society burns more calories per person than a 'more advanced'
   society.  Or that women have traditionally just sat around the house
   and raised babies.  It is cute story that some want to believe.  Unless
   you eat at mcdonalds every day, cutting carbs is not the issue.  This
   guy is dangerous because he is an authority figure spouting garbage.

   That's what I've been referring to the Twistex team's death as.

   If there was any sense left in the storm chaser community, their deaths
   should finally end the storm chaser fad, which has been operating for
   years on the basic fact that nobody's been killed doing it.  Well, one
   of the most careful, most skilled, and longest-chasing pioneers got
   killed doing it.

   If it can happen to them, it can happen to anyone.  How many more
   people are going to get killed before the fad tails off?

       ...I think chasing twisters should come at a price.  Force the
       people clogging up the roads around OK, TX, KS and NE to get
       training in basic EMT and storm spotting skills, license them,
       deputize them and give them emergency vehicle privileges on the
       roads during a tornado event.
       In return, they'd HAVE to stop at damage with people involved to
       render aid and assistance, constantly feed updates to police, etc.
        Right now, amateur spotters are profiting off the public commons
       with nothing contributed to it, and causing direct harm during
       emergency situations.  It has to change.
