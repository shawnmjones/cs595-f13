   Using social media to end rape in India
   Report: Rape every 22 minutes in India

   She was airlifted to the hospital in Nagpur and put on a ventilator but
   did not survive.

   "The doctors tried very hard but were not successful," hospital
   spokesman P.S. Shriram said.

   Police say the suspect, Firoz Khan, has confessed to the assault.

   [43]Opinion: India can learn respect for women

   "We hope from the administration, the police and the court that a
   fast-track court will hear the case and that the accused will be given
   the death sentence," said one of the girl's relatives, Aalok Vajpayee.

   Last week, two arrests were made in the case of another victim, a
   [44]5-year-old girl who was raped in New Delhi.

   The assaults on the girls came just four months after a 23-year-old
   physiotherapy student was gang-raped in a bus in New Delhi, setting off
   furious protests in India. [45]She later died at a Singapore hospital.

   After the attacks, the country's news media turned their attention to
   some of the thousands of rape cases reported in the nation each year.

   In a recent report, the Asian Center for Human Rights cited statistics
   that it said showed 48,338 child rape cases were reported in India
   between 2001 and 2011. The report said the number of cases rose from
   2,113 in 2001 to 7,112 in 2011.
