School steps up security after California girl's stabbing death

   By Paul Vercammen and Ed Payne, CNN
   updated 7:10 PM EDT, Mon April 29, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: The coroner's office says Leila Fowler died after suffering
       multiple stab wounds
     * NEW: Amid stepped up security, parents at her elementary school say
       they're afraid
     * NEW: School principal: "I don't think I ever saw Leila without a
       smile on her face"
     * The girl's brother "is not a suspect at this time," a sheriff's
       spokesman says

   Valley Springs, California (CNN) -- Sheriff's deputies on foot and in
   patrol cars made their presence known at a northern California school
   on Monday.

   Amid the stepped up security, classmates at Jenny Lind Elementary
   School carried flowers for Leila Fowler. Their parents held onto fear.

   "I'm scared for my kids, for the family," mother Wendy Converse said.
   "It's horrible."

   Fowler, an 8-year-old third-grader at the school, was stabbed to death
   at her home over the weekend.

   As police search for suspects, word of the killing has left many shaken
   in the community, which is about an hour outside of Sacramento.

   No suspects in girl's stabbing death

   "Leila was bubbly, she was vivacious, a great student. ... I don't
   think I ever saw Leila without a smile on her face," Amy Hasselwander,
   the school's principal, told [41]CNN affiliate KCRA. "Just a bright
   girl, just kind, compassionate, sincere to everyone."

   Converse said her son, Elijah, was friends with Leila.

   "They sit together at school. It's very sad," she said. "Things like
   that don't happen here."

   The girl died of shock and hemorrhages caused by multiple stab wounds,
   the Calaveras County Coroner's Office said on Monday.

   Her mother said the family was still coming to grips with their loss.

   "We are devastated," Crystal Walters, Leila's mother, told CNN via
   Facebook correspondence early Monday. "She didn't deserve this. ... She
   was so full of life."

   No suspect named

   Police say Leila and her brother were home alone on Saturday when he
   saw an intruder leaving the house.

   He then found his sister stabbed and severely wounded. She died minutes
   after arriving at the hospital, authorities said.

   Since then, police have been running down leads but say they have no
   specific suspect.

   "We're searching extensively into attics and storage sheds. It is a
   difficult area to search -- it is rural, remote and the grass is tall
   right now," Calaveras County Sheriff's Capt. Jim Macedo said.

   Authorities have combed the home and the neighborhood for evidence.

   "We did collect fingerprints during that search," Macedo said, "and we
   did collect what we believe to be DNA. Those prints and DNA will
   hopefully be processed within the next week."

   A neighborhood on edge

   Word of the killing rattled many residents in the neighborhood.

   Michael Range, who lives near the Fowlers, said he heard about Leila's
   deadly stabbing from a boy who lives nearby.

   "I took my kids instantly and locked the doors," he said. "It was
   scary. We've been inside all weekend."

   Ryan Wydner, who lives across the street from the Fowlers, said the
   girl's death left him feeling anxious.

   "Anything's really possible at this point," he said. "What's the
   difference between that guy going left and right and coming into my
   house? I don't know."

   While authorities said they had "no specific suspect," they are looking
   for a white or Hispanic male with a muscular build, about 6 feet tall,
   wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and blue pants. He is considered to
   be armed and dangerous, the Sheriff's Office said.

   Macedo said the boy who found his sister "is not a suspect at this
   time, but we are continuing to talk to him, which would be normal
   because he was the last person with the child."

   Detectives continue to track down dozens of leads phoned into a tip
   line created Saturday, including some leading to other counties, he
   said.

   More than 100 members of the law enforcement community are working on
   this case, Macedo said.
