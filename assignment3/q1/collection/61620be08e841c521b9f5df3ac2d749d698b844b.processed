[47]5 Things to Know for Your New Day - Friday, July 26th, 2013

   Welcome to the Friday edition of "5 Things to Know for Your New Day."

   Every weekday morning around 6, we'll hit the top five stories of the
   day, clue you in on a few other buzzy items, and let you know about
   some of the must-watch stories coming up on CNN's new morning show,
   "New Day."

   1. ZIMMERMAN JUROR SPEAKS

   Feeling guilty: She says she hurts as much as Trayvon Martin's mother.
   She says she owes Sybrina Fulton - and Tracy Martin - an apology. But
   [48]she also told ABC there wasn't evidence in George Zimmerman's trial
   to result in a conviction. Maddy was the juror who almost caused a hung
   jury but she changed her vote to not guilty. "I fought to the end," she
   told ABC.

     Juror B29 - if you had just stood your ground like Zimmerman
     supposedly did then justice might have actually prevailed.

     -- Danielle Mason-Rains (@nelliebellie223) [49]July 26, 2013

   Pamela Brown joins us all morning with more on the story.

   2. WEINER'S OTHER WOMAN

   Feeling manipulated: A woman who took part in racy chats with Anthony
   Weiner [50]sees him in a different light these days. He once told her
   he was an "argumentative, perpetually horny, middle-aged man," she
   claims. Nuh uh, she said at the time. Now? Oh, he is, she says. Sydney
   Leathers told the TV tabloid show, "Inside Edition," that the mayoral
   candidate is trying to pull one over on NYC voters.

   At 7, CNN political analyst John Avalon joins us with political
   commentator Ana Navarro. Jim Moret of "Inside Edition" will be with us
   at 8.

   3. DEADLY TRAIN CRASH

   "It felt like a roller coaster": Police are questioning the engineer of
   a fast-moving train that crashed on a curve in Spain and [52]killed at
   least 80 people. Scary video of the accident and the words of one
   survivor appear to support the theory that the train was going way too
   fast. Another rider says one moment he was writing in his journal and
   the next, [53]he was covered in blood.

   Karl Penhaul will be live from the crash site in Spain at 6 and 7.

   4. CLEVELAND KIDNAPPINGS CASE

   Seeking a plea: Amanda Berry, Georgina "Gina" DeJesus and Michelle
   Knight don't want a trial, where they would have to testify against
   Ariel Castro. And there's a chance they won't, if prosecutors and the
   defense team can [55]work out a plea deal. A court source says Castro
   could avoid the death penalty if he pleads guilty. Another source says
   a deal could be in place by the time Castro appears at a pre-trial
   hearing today.

   Gary Tuchman has the latest developments at 8.

   5. O.J. SIMPSON PAROLE HEARING

   Let me go; I've been good: O.J. Simpson says he's one of the best
   prisoners ever. So those final 28 years of his sentence? [57]He's
   served enough time, he says. We'll see in two weeks if the parole board
   that heard his case yesterday agrees with him. Simpson did admit that
   he brought the wrong people with him when he went to get items he
   thought belonged to him back from a memorabilia dealer. "That's on me,"
   he says.

   Ted Rowlands looks at what Simpson told the parole board yesterday.

   Those are your five biggies for the day. Here are a couple of others
   that are brewing and have the Internet buzzing.

   -Now that's our kind of car pool: Once before heading in to cover an
   event, I left the sunroof open on a hot day. And that hot day produced
   a terrible afternoon thunderstorm, which left several inches of water
   in the car. It was awfully unpleasant driving home. No one would ever
   intentionally do that, would they? Well, four guys in Germany took a
   cool BMW convertible and turned the interior into a cool pool. They ran
   off when police tried to question them, so no word on why they did it
   and if there was alcohol involved.

   - Put a hex on You(Tube): YouTube posted a tweet (hint - it's in hex)
   telling people to type the characters "/ geekweek" (don't forget the
   space!) into the YouTube's search bar. When you do, the site goes
   `retro' to commemorate their upcoming showcase of nerdy channels and
   other content called Geek Week.

     Crack the code to go retro: 53 65 61 72 63 68 20 59 6f 75 54 75 62

   -Ice storm a brewin': There's a raging cyclone in the Arctic. That's
   right, in the Arctic. It's ripping up sea ice, the Canadian Press
   reports, and while it may not be as powerful as last year's big storm,
   the ice is more vulnerable.

   - Tree-ting that itch: Bear. Itch. Tree. Cuteness. But he or she better
   hope the other bears don't see this.

   There you go. All you need to know to get an early start to your
   morning.
   Be sure to tune in to "New Day," from 6 to 9 a.m. ET, join us at
   [63]CNN.com/NewDay and go and have a GREAT NEW DAY

       Poor OJ. Let me get a box of tissues so I can cry for you. Never
       mind. I don't have any tears for armed robbers/murders.

       Nice try, OJ. You get out as soon as you resurrect your wife.

            That is not why he is jailed. He was acquitted in the Nicole
            Brown case.

                 who cares Tom, he is guilty on that charge regardless of
                 what the courts say....

       The Southampton Bathing Club which Chris Cuomo's wife is reportedly
       a member of, probably wouldn't allow Jeff Zucker (New CNN chief) or
       Michael Gershensen (Kate Bolduan's husband) to join because they're
       Jewish. Hate racism!

       O.J. probably has a shot at a reduced sentence. 33 years for what
       he and his buddies did is a bit steep but ... don't do the crime if
       ya can't do the time. 5 years served out of 33 years sentenced
       seems as if he's getting off easy - but the sooner he gets out, the
       sooner he can find a way to pay back the civil suit judgement
       against him for slaughtering Ron Goldman. Ha! Ha!

       If OJ confesses to killing his ex-wife, he should be paroled for
       this crime, but sentenced to life in solitary confinement for their
       brutal murder. i haven't seen the black community complaining about
       the jury's verdict in this case for some reason.

            i was wondering how long it would be before race is brought
            up. You people need a cure. Try traveling a bit farther.

       Gee Oj u would think u were smarter than go after your belongings
       with better ppl than that? Now the court have u were they want u.
       You could have went to court and the Court would have decided what
       to do with your stuff.
