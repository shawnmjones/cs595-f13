[22]Open thread for night owls: Stagnant inflation-adjusted median household
income slips in July

   Night Owls
   Every month, Doug Short [29]takes a look at Sentier Research's update
   of median household income. The numbers for July are up. And they are,
   as they have been for quite some time, sad.

   At first glance, median household incomes look to be improving. They
   were, in fact, up $15 month-over-month and $1,286 year-over-year. But
   those are just nominal figures. Adjusting for inflation gives us the
   "real" median income  And with the adjustment applied, real incomes
   were fell $68 from June (-0.1 percent) and have risen onl $291 year
   over year (+0.6 percent). And, as Short reminds us, those numbers do
   not take into account the expiration of the 2 percent payroll tax cut.
   Since January 2000, median real income is down 7.3 percent.

   In a press release, Sentier spokesman Gordon Green states:

     Since December 2011 we have been in a period of income stagnation
     without any clear trend of direction. Real median annual household
     income has essentially remained at the same level over this time
     period, despite significant reductions in the official unemployment
     rate, the average duration of unemployment, and a broad measure of
     employment hardship. The failure of an improved labor market to
     translate into higher levels of household income raises troubling
     questions about the types of jobs created over the past year and a
     half, the level of pay that they generate, and the effect on
     household income levels from people who have dropped out of the
     labor force altogether.

   Here's Short:

     The first chart below is an overlay of the nominal values and real
    monthly values chained in July 2013 dollars. The red line illustrates
    the history of nominal median household, and the blue line shows the
                      real (inflation-adjusted value).

   Chart on household income

   [The chart below shows] the a three-month moving average. The MA trend
   has been zigzagging higher since the trough in 2011, although the trend
        over the past 12 months has been one of sideways volatility.

   [30]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in
   2004--Conservative liberals and the radical restorationists:

   Conservatism has a bad rap around these parts. It's a concept generally
    associated with the right wing of the Republican Party, which is home
     to the some of the most odious policy ideas currently polluting our
       discourse and government. But what does it mean, really, to be
    conservative? Does it mean to be permanently staked out on the right
   fringe of of the GOP, regardless of what the party represents? Or does
    it mean that one favors the current order, and that any change should
                    be measured and carefully considered?

     I suppose that it means both those things, and a helluva lot more,
    besides. Words, especially adjectives, are tricky beasts to pin down,
     especially when they're primarily used in political contexts. But I
    raise the question because last night, Bush attacked Kerry's claim to
     have a conservative philosophy. Now, on one level -- the level that
   reflexively finds all of us labeling Bush, Delay, et al "conservatives"
    -- Bush's charge is on the mark. Kerry is no right-winger. But if you
   think about it for a second, and look at these folks in terms of their
   resistance to radical change, Kerry is clearly on to something when he
   describes himself as the conservative candidate. And when you consider
     Bush's presidency and governing philosophy, he doesn't appear very
        conservative at all. In fact, he's possibly the most radical
                      presidential candidate since FDR.

   [32][584ffc5c4745e4d770cda05cca5205a2_normal.jpeg] It's a laughable
   commentary that what happened today at the Senate was repeatedly called
   a "debate."

   On today's [35]Kagro in the Morning show, Greg Dworkin rounded up local
   news Newtown, national news from Congress (h/t to Doctor Who), and
   international news on Syria. Richard Cohen has somehow become the
   Twitter talk of the morning, for... well, it was too annoying to really
   talk about. Facepalm-worthy GunFAIL from Lodi, CA. Armando joined in
   for the Syria discussion. [36]NYC City Council candidate and longtime
   netroots friend Debra Cooper, updated us on the state of the race, with
   some surprising background on another Dem candidate's previous support
   for Rudy Giuliani--in his brief bid for the Senate against Hillary
   Clinton, no less!

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [52]Tagging tips - [53]Search For Tags - [54]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       As far as latexsolarbeef goes, first thing I thought of was a new
       Monsanto patent involving pasture fed cows that shrink wrap
       themselves on the hoof.  It's actually a kinda neat nickname.

   You must have functions falling out of your ears.

   I wish you the very best as you hunt for the perfect niche in which to
   begin your new profession.  It wouldn't surprise me a bit if
   statisticians surge in demand as insurance companies and state
   exchanges and federal law begin the long road towards some semblance of
   order in the new healthcare system.  That might be a place to start
   looking -- and it might be the only part of the economy that truly
   expands over the next several years.

   I will limit it to this.
   In 1962, Adlai Stephenson presented to the UN evidence that the USSR
   was shipping nuclear weapons to Cuba, in front of God and everybody. It
   was irrefutable. The difference, today, is that the UN already knows
   what happened in Syria, but are hesitant. They have the evidence in
   their grasp and are verifying it. Fine, I'm all for that. The most
   important thing in the world is for all countries to have not a shadow
   of a doubt about the evidence. That was JFK genius.
   I have no doubt as to what happened, or who caused it, but I am not the
   world. Prove it, then, it's up to you humanity.

     White Sheriff Scolds Black College President for Hosting Rap

     This year, at the request of students, Florida Gulf Coast University
     booked Kendrick Lamar and Ludacris as the headliners at its annual
     "Eaglepalooza" concert. Well-- the local sheriff is outraged that
     FGCU's president-- a black man!-- would stand for this filth.

     Who better than a white, Republican southern sheriff to stand up as
     a lone voice for racial justice? FGCU's president, Wilson Bradshaw,
     is a black man. "I am amazed that a black University President would
     sanction such a disgrace; especially during the 50th anniversary of
     Dr. King's speech," writes Sheriff Mike Scott, our generation's
     Bayard Rustin. He has a thing or two to teach Wilson Bradshaw, about
     race!

   Second, for the assorted brainiacs trying to assure me that "This is
   just some limited/tactical/targeted strikes" and not war, whether or
   not you openly declare it as such, it is still war. Imagine some
   country bombing our soil as an expression of disapproval for how we
   treat our folks and see if we wouldn't take that as an act of war.

 Wage stagnation: Jared Bernstein @CBPP ([794]12+ / 0-)

   A decade of flat wages for working middle class folk

   [807]Jared Bernstein @ CBPP  uses a term that defeats the carefully
   crafted GOP spin (lie) on wealth "distribtution " - the big
   "socialist/liberal" evil - by using the term primary distribution of
   wealth.

    How wealth is stolen by the 1%ers in addition to tax [808]loopholes,
   skimming wealth right off the top first. And to cover this systematic
   pre-tax theft the GOP has long used a Frank Luntzish rewording -
   "redistrbution" of wealth as though the extractors (1%ers) who have
   done the skimming in the first place are being ripped off by having to
   pay taxes at all.

     In fact, we need to think about solutions to this problem is a new
     way. To explain, let me introduce some terminology. The primary
     distribution is the income, wage and wealth status of households
     generated by market outcomes, before taxes and all kinds of other
     policies kick in to help those on the short end of those outcomes
     (i.e., transfer policies, like food stamps or unemployment
     insurance).  The secondary distribution is the income distribution
     after taxes and transfers.

     Of course, policy plays a role in market outcomes. The primary
     distribution is not some pristine, meritocratic outcome devoid of
     political or policy influence. Trade policy, for example, creates
     winners and losers; the tax system itself, by favoring investment
     income over wage income, tilts market outcomes.
      - emphasis added

   And Thx Egberto Willies for this:

     Missing from the narrative however is the recovery of ill gotten
     gains from those that have played the system. While much of this
     pilfering was done within the constructs of the laws that were
     produced by corrupt politicians, these ill gotten gains must be
     recovered through diligent tax policies

   [823]http://www.dailykos.com/...

   I saw him outside of a local book store around five years ago at a big
   book signing when I was on my lunch break. He was in a wheelchair and
   looked like hell.

   I really loved his book Gateway in 1977. In the novel, mankind
   discovers a hollowed-out asteroid filled with alien artifacts including
   spaceships. We learn to operate them by pretty much pushing buttons at
   random. The protagonist, Robinette Broadhead, is a poor worker on Earth
   who wins a lottery with just enough money to buy a ticket to Gateway
   where there is a good chance to become very rich through space
   exploration. Once he gets there, he chickens out and just stays on
   Gateway. He finally accepts a mission. The consequences of that mission
   leave him scarred for life. Much of the story is told as a conversation
   with his psychiatrist in a brief case whom he calls, Sigfrid von
   Shrink.

   Gateway won the 1978 Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novel.

   The next novel in the series is Beyond the Blue Event Horizon in 1980.
   A spaceship sent off by Robin Broadhead (now filthy rich) to the Oort
   Cloud finds a food factory. (CHON food) As the crew examines the ship
   the youngest crew member, Janine, finds a young boy named Wan who was
   forgotten on the ship for the past fifteen years.

   We get to meet the aliens in the third novel, Heechee Rendezvous. Wan
   steals a ship and Heechee equipment, including something called a
   corkscrew that allows you to stick your head inside of an event horizon
   and look around. Wan goes from black hole to black hole, looking for
   his father.

   I thought that Heechee Rendezvous was a great book! It didn't win many
   awards, though. This could be because it was 1985 and it was up against
   Neuromancer and Ender's Game and The Integral Trees and Blood Music and
   The Peace War and The Postman and Green Eyes.

       I had the diarist's name and most of the title and it gave me three
       diaries that had zero in common with the one I was looking for.
       Nothing.
       I read them and the comments along with the tags, no connection

       But we never catch up. Raises used to be more than inflation. Now,
       IF  we get a raise, It's barely that. Most people are taking on
       more responsibility: helping out their parents, siblings, raising
       grand kids, nieces, nephews, or having friends sacked out pretty
       much permanently in the spare room or on the couch. We just feel
       lucky that we are in a position to help.
       And everything from utilities to food to housing is getting more

       Average is affected by that top 1% or 2% because there is no top
       bound.
       The median is literally the value in the middle, ie: half is
       greater and half is lower. It is not pulled up by high values at
       the top and it is not pulled down by low values at the bottom.

 Firearms Law and Policy is planning ([1160]0+ / 0-)

   to walk all across the country, state-by-state, and will dedicate a
   diary to a survey of each state's gun laws. Sound interesting? If you
   would like to write about gun laws in your state please send a Kosmail
   to [1161]LilithGardener.

   We published our first diary last week, [1162]Introducing a new Group:
   Firearms Law and Policy - Glossary of Resources

   Please drop by, say hello, and check out our Glossary of great links to
   law and policy resources.

   To join and write for us Kosmail [1163]LilithGardener.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   To advocate effectively for repeal or passage of firearms legislation
   we must first know and understand current law and policy, and how both
   are implemented, where we live. There is enormous variability across
   the country; the relative utility/relative risk of firearms is
   different on a 500 acre ranch in Montana than for a 1000 square foot
   apartment in New York. State and local laws reflect that diversity. We
   will discuss firearms law and policy with an emphasis on the many
   historical ethics and ideals of Western Civilization, as opposed to
   what are currently known as "Libertarian" ideals.

   This group is also a study group; a place to learn and discuss which
   gun regulations are constitutional restrictions in this post-Heller
   environment. (A law degree is not required). With Congressional
   gridlock likely to impede any useful national legislation, progress
   will have to be made at the state and local level.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ------------------------------
   Please note: We are not a subgroup of the Daily Kos RKBA group and do
   not agree with their foundation premise, but hope they will share their
   insights into state and local laws that work.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   To join us send a message to the [1164]Firearms Law and Policy Group.

 NYT: How Fragile Is the New Democratic Coalition? ([1167]0+ / 0-)

   Looking at state level politics may not be the correct granularity.  We
   need to pay much more attention downballot and start ensuring that
   every race is challenged.

   [1168]How Fragile Is the New Democratic Coalition?

     In 1988, the Democratic presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis,
     carried 26 percent of the nation's counties, 819 of 3,144, on his
     way to losing the Electoral College 426-111 and the popular vote by
     seven percentage points. In 2012, President Obama won fewer
     counties, 690, but he won the popular vote by four points and the
     Electoral College in a landslide, 332-206.
     [...]
     "The Big Sort" focuses on one of the key factors behind these
     geographic trends: people are increasingly choosing to move into
     neighborhoods and communities of like-minded people who share their
     political views, creating what Bishop and Cushing call "way-of-life
     segregation."

     Americans, in their view,

         have been sorting themselves over the past three decades into
     homogeneous communities -- not at the regional level, or the
     red-state/blue-state level, but at the micro level of city and
     neighborhood.
