[22]Office of Congressional Ethics now investigating possible Bachmann
campaign finance violations

   U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN) at the 38th annual
   Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) meeting at the Marriott
   Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, February 10, 2011. The CPAC is a
   project of the American Conservative Union Foundation
   Oops.
   Michele Bachmann's troubles [29]keep getting deeper:

     The Daily Beast has learned that federal investigators are now
     interviewing former Bachmann campaign staffers nationwide about
     alleged intentional campaign-finance violations. The investigators
     are working on behalf of the Office of Congressional Ethics, which
     probes reported improprieties by House members and their staffs and
     then can refer cases to the House Ethics Committee. [...]

     Former staffers tell The Daily Beast that investigators have
     allegedly asked about allegations of improper transfer of funds and
     under-the-table payments actions by Bachmann's presidential
     campaign, specifically in relation to the campaign's national
     political director, Guy Short, and Bachmann's onetime Iowa campaign
     chairman, state Sen. Kent Sorenson. Questions directly about
     Bachmann, they said, have been primarily focused on what she knew
     about those men's actions and when she knew it.

   Yeah, [30]who [31]would [32]have [33]thought.

   The good news is that this is the House Ethics Committee, and if you've
   been following the antics of the House of late, you know that the whole
   concept of "Ethics" has been substantially dumbed down in recent years.
   You're still not allowed to cook and eat the congressional pages (ha,
   just kidding--Republicans had to shut down the 175+-year-old page
   program after certain ... incidents ... took place) but on nearly
   anything else, you're mostly home free.

   Bachmann has been facing high staff turnover and more than a few
   stories pegging her as an all-around terrible person to work for, which
   surprises exactly nobody. We'll see if her status rises from
   "insufferable crackpot" to "person officially recognized by House
   Republicans as one of the few people in America too unethical even for
   them," but I can't keep myself from hoping.

   As a bonus from the article, here's an ex-staffer explaining the mind
   of Michele Bachmann:

     "She doesn't use the most credible sources," explains one former
     staffer, detailing Bachmann's reliance on stories from the
     conspiracy-peddling WorldNet Daily to shape her worldview, "and she
     tends to listen to the last person who talks to her." Bachmann is
     also a member of the House Intelligence Committee.

   World Net Daily. Classic.

   Bachmann's also being investigated by the FEC over possible improper
   payments to Guy Short; something you can do to help is to [34]sign our
   petition asking the FEC for a speedy and transparent inquiry into these
   and other incidents during her campaign.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Unless she stole lots of money, this will probably go nowhere.

       He's been involved from the Nixon White House through today's mess,
       getting America involved in countless wars at the cost of untold
       thousands of lives killed, tortured, maimed and missing and
       hundreds of billions of dollars if not trillions of dollars
       funneled to himself and his buddies in the MIC and banking
       industries. Next contest?

   over the years, Michele Bachmann has always been allergic to the word
   ethics.

   Anyone still thinking that wanting to own a gun is normal? Wanting to
   own a gun is an immediate indicator that you should be the last person
   to have one.

   Obviously she doesn't listen to the letters and phone calls I make.  In
   fact, I would bet her staff carefully screens my stuff out and she
   never hears any of it.  I never get any feedback from her other than an

   Please tell me that if she is determined to be in violation of ethics
   rules, she will forfeit both her job and her ongoing benefits,
   including pension and health care.

   When honest, hard-working individuals in the real world lose their jobs
   (through employer whimsy, not because of ethics violations or inability
   to do their work) they often sacrifice everything.

   All of these golden parachute protections for the precious few are
   among the "entitlements" people should be concerned about.  And the
   powerful, wealthy and protected are the ones who wail loudest about
   "entitlements" that must be clawed away from the lesser folks.
