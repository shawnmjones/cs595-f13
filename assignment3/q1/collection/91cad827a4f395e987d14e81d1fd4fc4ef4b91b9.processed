[24]Another of the military's sexual assault prevention officers investigated
for sexual assault

   Army sexual assault awareness/prevention material saying
   You're gonna need more than a new poster for this one.
   Yeah, [30]I think I see the problem here:

     A sergeant first class in charge of sexual assault prevention at
     Fort Hood is under investigation for sexual assault, the Pentagon
     announced Tuesday night.

     The soldier, whose name has not been released, is being investigated
     for abusive sexual contact, pandering, assault and maltreatment of
     subordinates. The soldier has been relieved of his duties at the
     Texas post, and no charges have yet been filed, the Pentagon said.
     He oversaw the program at the battalion level, a unit of about 800
     soldiers.

     The soldier is being investigated for, among other things, forcing a
     subordinate into prostitution and sexually assaulting two others,
     according to a Capitol Hill staffer who was briefed on the case and
     spoke about it on condition of anonymity.

     Two senior Pentagon officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity
     because the case is under investigation, also confirmed that the
     sergeant is being investigated for running a prostitution ring.

   This would be different from the [31]other "sexual assault prevention
   program" officer arrested for sexual assault, and the need to actually
   clarify which "sexual assault prevention program" officer being
   arrested for sexual assault we're talking about may suggest that even
   the military culture around "sexual assault prevention programs" may
   need a bit of damn work.

   Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has "[32]directed all service branches
   to re-train, re-credential and re-screen" officers implementing the
   military's sexual assault prevention and response programs. Sen. Claire
   McCaskill, for one, [33]isn't impressed:

     Sen. Claire McCaskill is among the female senators on the Armed
     Services Committee leading the push against sexual assault in the
     military, and the Missouri Democrat is now mobilizing her campaign
     supporters behind the effort.

     "Instead of focusing on prosecution, there has been an effort to
     `train' their way out of this problem with programs discussing
     unwanted sexual contact or encouraging a buddy system for women on
     bases," McCaskill wrote an in email to her campaign mailing list.
     "It's not going to work. This isn't a problem the military can
     `train' its way out of."

   Can't say she's wrong about that one. Glad she won her election, or
   we'd instead have Republican poster boy Todd "Legitimate Rape" Akin
   helping to decide what to do about sexual assaults in the military, and
   I imagine that wouldn't have gone well. Call it a [34]hunch.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Her word was sickening, and she couldn't be more correct. We need
       better laws and enforcement of the laws. This needs to be pulled
       from the chain of command since command is part of the problem. I

 Women in Combat? ([136]11+ / 0-)

   I've heard the reason given for women not being in combat that they
   would be raped if taken prisoner.  It seems that our female soldiers
   are in as much danger of sexual assault from our own forces as they
   would be from an enemy.

       And I think that any woman who would serve in combat would
       understand that risk and (while not willingly) take it on
       knowingly.  As any service member would know that in combat
       operations they risk, death, injury, capture, torture etc...
       No one should need to take on that risk by merely serving in the
       military.  It is entirely unacceptable and needs to be addressed in
       no uncertain terms.  NO more sweeping allegations under the rug.
       NO more punishing the victim of crimes.  There is no honor in
       serving while these conditions exist for any subset of military
       personnel.

       If convicted, they need to be designated as RSO's.  Women have a
       right to know who these creeps are so they can take precautions
       against being victimized by them.

       Given that the inability to feel empathy is the among the first

   but it needs to include the consequences of violating the laws against
   sexual harassment and rape, and it needs to include resources for
   victims so they can get help and report the crimes.

   Then the military needs to back it up by prosecuting offenders and
   putting them in jail. Only then will it penetrate the consciousness of
   the soldiers that are likely to commit those acts.

       is a poor substitute for the district attorney in the civilian

 you say the military court system isnt adequate ([249]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:

       beyond a doubt?
       So I ask, compared to the civilian system:
       what kind of cases get prosecuted in both systems? (e.g. who
       prosecutes "date rape" or sexual assaults with intoxication of the
       victim?)
       what are the convictions rates in both systems, by offense type?
       what programs are available for alleged victims in both systems?
       what are the average sentences in each system by offense type?
       (on this one, I'm fully prepared that the military may be
       lighter--I'm in the system and I think often the sentences
       universally are lighter than I'd expect much of the time)
       I am not proposing that all is hunky dory, but I keep seeing folks
       saying the military court system is inadequate, and yet I do not
       see any evidence that civilian courts take more cases to trial, or
       that they do better as far as conviction when compared by case type
       to the military.
       I know that the military takes cases to trial the civilians pass on
       all of the time.  I've yet to come across a case, involving a
       military accused, that the civilian community DOES take.  I know
       obviously it happens, but I've not personally seen it in ten years
       of doing military criminal law.

       I suppose if the argument is that there is no court system in the

       doesn't seem to be the point being made, it's that the military

       I can't count the number of ways the military justice system has
       fundamentally changed since then.  Not simply on sexual assault,
       but across the board.  The MREs are different, the punitive
       articles many of them are different, some gone, some added, the
       emphasis on criminal law is different.
       If that's your starting point, then the military has improved
       astronomically.

       The military has proven beyond doubt, that they either don't see it
       as a problem, or that they're inept at prosecuting the abuse. (I
       suspect the former) 22 years since Tailhook and still, they FAIL.
       That's obvious cause for taking those cases out of the hands of the
       DoD.
       Obviously you have a personal interest and I'm not trying to offend
       you. As the widow of a vet, I have the greatest respect for the
       military...just not when it comes to their cavalier attitudes on
       sexual abuse in the ranks. As the mother of two daughter, I think
       too many women (primarily, but not exclusively women) are being
       sexually assaulted with no recourse.
       Almost anything would be preferable to the status quo.

       you can't just say proven beyond a doubt, what proves it exactly?
       We've done the following things in the last 6 years or so:
       Established military victim advocates for every unit
       Established civilian victim advocates at every base
       Conduct monthly reviews at the senior base commander level of every
       reported sexual assault
       I can absolutely tell you that the military often takes cases that
       the civilian world turns down, and that we take a lot more cases to
       trial now then we did in the early to mid 2000s.  Cases that I got
       dismissed early as a young defense counsel are now cases that go to
       trial now that I am on the government side.
       There is annual training on sexual assault
       The recruits get additional training
       Many of the training installations have gotten rid of giving
       recruits off-post passes (pass + alcohol equaled a lot of
       intoxicated victims that got taken advantage of).
       The army has introduced special victim prosecutors at most large
       basis who are talented and who do nothing but prosecute sexual
       assault cases
       They've introduced high quality civilian experts, career
       prosecutors with 1000s of sexual assault cases under their belt to
       train prosecutors
       So what more do you think needs to be done on the military
       court/justice side?

 Not very realistic... ([279]0+ / 0-)

   Dumping the entire military justice system for sexual assaults is not
   only unrealistic, it would likely be harmful to the soldiers that we
   are trying to protect.

   As an example, a sexual assault that occurs in Afghanistan would not be
   prosecuted effectively (if at all) in the Afghan civilian court system,
   which has a record of blaming the victim for her own assault. Even in
   the USA, some civilian courts too often do the same thing.

       shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what rape and sexual

       Using sex as a weapon is about power, control, abuse, violence and
       brutality.  It isn't really about sex.  It is about predation.
       While sexual predators may have preferences about what "type" of
       prey they pursue, they are not expressing anything close to normal
       sexual desires and shouldn't be confused as to be doing so.
       The Chain of Command is currently aligned to protect predators and
       further injure/eject victims.  It doesn't matter what sex you are
       in the face of that kind of system.  Neither men nor women can

   the documentary "The Invisible War".  It's very disturbing how rape is
   tolerated in the US military.  Few rapists are prosecuted.  Few rapists
   are court martialed.  Rapists frequently get promoted. Hundreds or even
   thousands of rapists learn how to commit rape and then beat the legal
   system while in the US military, then they are free to go out and rape
   in the general public, knowing how to beat the system.  Meanwhile the
   victim soldiers' lives are ruined.
   Generals have been tolerating this behavior for decades.

   Seems to me that the Congress can have immediate impact by saying, "The

       were with male veterans. Few of these attacks are reported because

       Meanwhile, their attackers rarely receive just punishment.

 What's a little misrepresentation among friends? ([470]0+ / 0-)

   This was a little too cute for words:

     This isn't a problem the military can `train' its way out of

   Can't see any place that the military claimed that it can.

   For review:

   1. This unfortunate story is about somebody being investigated, and, in
   all likelihood, being charged and tried for misconduct.

   That is not training.

   2. The military has said that it needs to "re-train, re-credential, and
   re-screen" -- which is not a claim that training will solve the
   problem.  That credentialing and screening stuff? That's where you try
   to weed out bad apples.

   It is certainly appropriate to question whether the military's response
   will be adequate -- just as it is appropriate to question the response
   of civilian organizations to similar problems -- the military, it
   seems, is

   1. Investigating,
   2. Prosecuting,
   3. Questioning the adequacy of its efforts to date,
   4. Going through its current personnel to determine if changes need to
   be made, and
   5. Training.

   What more should they do?
   And, as an aside, does more training seem like a bad idea?

       more of that," perhaps a change in the whole system is
       needed--certainly including training, and much more besides.

 Some perspective ([489]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [490]milton333, [491]DrillSgtK

   Please keep in mind that the total active duty population of the US
   military is over 1.4 million.  Add in the civilian personnel working
   for the services and DoD and its over 2.1 million.  Do bad things
   happen when 2.1 million people are involved.  Yes.  How dose DoD do
   compared to the general population - much better.

   The vast majority of military crimes are dealt with swiftly and
   effectively by commanders everywhere.  As a commander I was lucky to
   have only one sex related crime during 18 months in command.  One of my
   soldiers was accused of sexual assault.  He got lucky - he worked in a
   high security area that required pin access and had video monitoring
   and could prove he was not where he was accused of being.  Turned out
   he and his wife were going through a bad time and a neighbor thought
   she would "help out" by fabricating a story.  Crap like that makes it
   harder on all true victims.  Victims like my wife who was sexually
   harassed when she was on active duty by guys I KNEW.  Victims like the
   soldier who came to my door after a date rape who never pressed charges
   because she convinced herself it was her fault.

   What most outside the military fail to understand is that the fact
   these two cases are receiving so much attention is progress.  Just the
   fact that ANYONE outside of the military cares is progress.  It will
   shine a harsh light on the enablers - something that has been lacking.
    We do a good job of getting the actual perps but not the enablers.

 Never a pleasure ([498]0+ / 0-)
       Every time it has felt like I was kicking my own dog.  I had to
       punish a child abuser once.  Still felt horrible for days after.
       No the military is not the same.  Every time something like this
       happens the person responsible for imposing judgement KNOWS the
       criminal.
       If someone does something wrong at a civilian job the police come
       and arrest them.  They eventually see a judge if they plea out or a
       judge and jury if they go to trial.  None of those people know the
       accused.  In fact they would be excluded from being part of the
       process if they did.  No one at work has to be part of the jury.
       Their boss is not asked what punishment should be.
       For a military commander you know everything about the person
       standing in front of you.  You dont know know their family
       situation, you know their family.  You know their hopes and dreams
       - hopes and dreams that will potentially disappear based on your
       decisions.  And everyone knows that you have ABSOLUTE discretion in
       choosing punishment.  The flip side is that you own 100% of that
       punishment.  No mandatory minimums here, only maximums.  You cant
       hide behind what others say you have to do and you cant even site
       what others have done because the UCMJ is explicit in that every
       case is judged on its merits separately.  My commander even
       cautioned me when I first took command that my punishments should
       be fair but there was no requirement to be consistent.  Every case
       is different and I needed to judge the whole soldier, not apply a
       formula.
       I have never met a commander who took any joy in administering
       justice.  When old guys sit around telling stories they rarely tell
       about punishing people unless there is a funny part.  The look in
       the eyes when you administer punishment sticks with you and haunts
       you.

 what people forget is there are two reporting... ([502]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [503]ksuwildkat

   systems for sexual harassment: Formal and Informal.

   The formal system is reported to the Chain of Command, gets
   investigated by CID and the Commander with reporting up the chain.  A
   formal complaint opens the victim to aid and counseling, but IF they
   are making a false claim the victim can face major punishment if it is
   found to be false.

   The informal system is not reported up the chain, gets dealt with at
   the company level, and any information gathered might not ever leave
   the company office or BN's SHARP.

   Many times I read in the paper about the sexual assaults that the
   military did not follow up on were informal systems where the victim
   refused to make a formal complaint or even name their assaulter.  Then,
   later they get all upset no one did anything.

   What this article misses is how should the military fix the problem of
   sexual harassment if training on how to report it, fight it, and stop
   it is not the answer?

   In the military much of what would be dealt with by lawyers, police and
   a court system is the responsibility of the Company Commander.  A
   person who not only deals with the military justice aspect of life but
   the training, mission, supply, organization, feeding, housing,
   maintenance, distribution, and health of everyone in the company. The
   CO normally is in charge of about as many people as a Wal-Mart Super
   Store manager (120 to 210) but with all aspects of life.

   Can you picture the Wal-Mart manager having to make sure the employees
   have food, housing, health care, training, working transportation, do
   their jobs, meet higher level managers directions, and handle all
   procedure violations and criminal law questions?

   That Company Commanders are able to do so well speaks great things
   about the people who serve the nation.

 Excellent Analysis ([507]0+ / 0-)
       As usual, NCOs lead the way.
       I find it frustrating to read about how terrible the military is
       and how broken our justice system is from people who have never
       spent a day in uniform.  heck, most dont even personally know
       anyone.  Considering less than 1% of the nation serves, its not
       surprising.  The Constitution gives two people the power to
       restrict the liberty of a citizen - a judge and a military
       commander.  Until you have been one of those people you should
       limit your criticism of either.
       Your comparison to a Wal Mart manager is especially apt - not only
       does the Wal Mart manager not know if his employees are eating well
       or living in adequate quarters, the low wages Wal Mart pays ensures
       many can only survive with government assistance.  He never gets a
       call at 2 AM because a stock boy got in trouble at a bar.  Never
       has to teach financial management to a teenager.  And of course he
       never has to decide punishment for anything.  Unlike that Wal Mart
       manager commanders and NCOs dont just wash their hands once
       punishment has been given.  The same NCOs who recommend punishment
       are expected to rehabilitate the offenders and make them productive
       again.  There simply is no comparison in the civilian world.

       Under the UCMJ the range of punishments for rape goes from "Oral
       admonishment" to death.  Included in there are things like
       discharges.
       In general, the military is hash compared to the civilian world
       when it comes to rape and to say that rapist "fare badly" in
       military prisons is an understatement.  They tend to have a lot of
       "accidents."
       My very first unit had a convicted rapist.  Male on male.  He had
       at least five victims who refused to press charges.  Embarrassment,
       shame, usual stuff.  The sixth time he was caught in the act and
       the victim was secure in his own sexuality and stood up in court.
       The prior bad acts were of course not admissible but the sentence -
       5 years, no parole for attempted rape - reflected wide knowledge
       that he was a serial offender.  I witnessed his first hours in
       confinement when the Correctional Sergeants reduced him to a
       pitiful mass in the fetal position crying and shaking.  "Intake" at
       a military prison is not for the compassionate.  A few months later
       we sent another from my unit to the same place for drugs.  While
       still brutal it was nothing like what had happened to SSG Rapist.
       We looked in on SSG Rapist.  He was not well.

   Been raped in her barracks at Ft. Shafter, HI. An investigation
   revealed other women had also been raped in the barracks but were
   afraid to report the rapes. It turned out there was a sex ring run by
   some of the upper male NCOS.They had a master key which opened the
   female rooms. In the investigation the females reported they did not
   feel safe in their rooms. So the battalion CO established a night time
   duty patrol among the senior officers during which the senior officers
   stood guard outside of the female rooms. It was not very popular among
   the senior officers, having to run babysitting duty. It lasted until
   that CO rotated out, which was about 6 months. At the time I thought he
   was wise and courageous, but now I think he probably should have
   informed CID and let them run a full investigation. This thing may be
