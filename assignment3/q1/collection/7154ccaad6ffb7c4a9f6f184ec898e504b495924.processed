     * South Korea's Samsung continued its aggressive growth in the
       smartphone market, dominating [29]4th Quarter shipments of its
       Google Android based cellphones:

     Samsung was the clear winner shipping an estimated 63.7 million
     smartphones, up 76% year over year, vs. Apple at 47.8 million, up
     29%.
     * Lithium carbonate, the key ingredient in the lithium-ion battery
       industry, contines to [30]increase in value:

     The current spot price for battery-grade lithium carbonate is $6,600
     a tonne, that's up from $5,500 a couple of years ago and a projected
     high of $8,500 by the end of the decade, according to researcher
     Roskill.
       So if you've got a place to put a couple of tons of LC, might be a
       good idea to invest.
     * California based Apple [31]lost its status as the world's most
       valuable company to the long time repeat champion, Exxon. Technolgy
       companies go up, technology companies go down. But Big Oil never
       goes away.
     * Twitter, Inc. [32]is expected to IPO next year. So far, it is
       commonly believed the company still has not turned in a profitable
       quarter. Yet, we're $9 to 11$ Billion in potential valuation. Brave
       new world.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [46]Tagging tips - [47]Search For Tags - [48]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Some of us were around a lot of vets while Vietnam was winding

 The protest wasn't against the soldiers. It was ([147]0+ / 0-)
       FOR the cameras.
       It could have happened but I seriously doubt it was organized or
       often.  But you have to remember that the Vietnam vets were NOT
       allowed into the VFW, either.  The WW2 vets did not like the
       Vietnam vets, they thought they were hippies.
       There was a great big dividing line then and it wasn't red and
       blue.  It was old and young.  The soldiers were young.  The hippies
       were young.  The WW2 vets were on the other side.
       There was no spitting in Seattle, in a parade, with many soldiers,
       less than a dozen vocal protesters.  They weren't saying anything
       at all to the soldiers.  They were shouting at the cameras that
       were covering the parade.

 "Hippie protesters"? ([155]0+ / 0-)
       I don't know what you'd call them.
       I sure as hell wouldn't call them protesters.
       A protest is a coherent thing, not plain nastiness.
       I took part in many protests.
       I don't remember taking anything out on the people who served us,
       regardless of my feeling wrt the cause itself.
       Well...
       I will admit to some unkind words for a few police officers, but
       they were chasing us down with big fucking sticks (aka riot batons)
       and tear gas.

 Obnoxious Behavior ([159]0+ / 0-)

   [160]Kill Anything that Moves:

     what American forces actually were doing in Vietnam.  [...] Turse
     discovers that episodes of devastation, murder, massacre, rape, and
     torture once considered isolated atrocities were in fact the norm,
     adding up to a continuous stream of atrocity, unfolding, year after
     year, throughout that country.

   Compared to the neverending atrocities US forces wreaked on millions of
   Vietnamese for a generation, shouting and obnoxious behavior seems a
   poor substitute for jailing them for war crimes.

       He dialed into a conference call, and while he was speaking we
       heard the unmistakable sound of a toilet flushing! We on the other

       then hear water from a sink (as we might have done had he washed

   You cannot show you have better ideas if you do not have better ideas

 also, Samsung is more innovative now ([550]0+ / 0-)
       I think that Samsung's success is a result of several factors, such
       as their product diversity, manufacturing advantage, and release of
       flagship devices on multiple carriers, but they have also
       consistently innovated and taken risks that have pushed the mobile
       market into new territory, at a time when Apple has stuck with
       incremental updates and turf defense via Patent Warfare.
       For example consider the Galaxy Note, which was widely considered a
       failure out the door by the tech media, but was in fact a financial
       success that revealed a large demographic of consumers who want a
       large screen phablet type device with a stylus. The successor, the
       Note 2, is selling even better than the original.
       Full disclosure: I'm posting this on a GN2. I wasn't a big fan of
       Samsung products at all until they released this phone, which is
       exactly what I've been waiting for years for someone to make.

       for days with a replacement battery (super important for a frequent
       traveler like me), which is not an option for iphone (or most other

       I'm a stickler for specs and usability, i.e., "function over form"

 And not only that, in a typical year Samsung ([563]0+ / 0-)

   spends $12 billion on advertising.  By contrast, Apple spends just $1
   billion.  Apple simply gets amazing returns on its operational
   investments.

   Apple's margins were squeezed a bit this quarter, but those were
   capital expenses related to expanding their iCloud infrastructure and
   R&D.  I consider those expenses to be worth it because it shows that
   Apple is continuing to innovate and think long term, as opposed to say
   try to crank out cheap ass iphone copies and race to the bottom like
   other companies do.  Right now, coupled with the panic selling, Apple

       At this point Apple's business model is completely reliant on its
       previous customers upgrading their Iphones every year. Last quarter
       was weak because not enough people switched to Iphone 5. This is
       also why they don't spend a lot on advertising. Samsung has a very
       sound business model and they are doing a pretty good job of
       targeting emerging markets. There is no shame in buying cheaper
       smart phones if you can't afford high end phones like Iphone 5. As
       I mentioned earlier, Samsung is doing very well with young people
       in the west and everyone in the emerging markets because of the
       price range and the variety they offer to the customers.

       A recent market study found that kids are now more interested in
       Galaxy S3 than iPhone. Meanwhile Apple is becoming more favored by
       older consumers (GenX and Boomers). That's not necessarily bad for
       Apple as those older generations have many more consumers switching
       to smartphones. But, as a hip trend setter, Apple may have lost
       some of it's magic. That's very bad for a company that depends on
       image as much as Apple does. I'd speculate that is one reason why
       Apple is being downgraded by analysts, despite massive
       profitability.

 true, but the rest of the quote says: ([583]0+ / 0-)

     The signs that youngest smartphone audience has cooled on Apple have
     been steadily accumulating over the past few months. Apple, for
     instance, dropped several spots or remained flat on several teen
     brand opinion polls, including marketing agency's Smarty Pants'
     Young Love survey. And while 67% of affluent teens still say they
     intend to purchase an iPhone as their next upgrade, reports Piper
     Jaffray, Samsung pulls in second with a strong 22%. Perhaps more
     importantly is the fact that it was unthinkable a mere 12 months ago
     that any teen would prefer any phone to an iPhone if given the
     option.
       I definitely remembered that survey wrong, but as the quote above
       suggests, Apple has been so dominant for so long with American
       teens that it's a significant development that there is ANY
       interest by "trendsetters" in another brand. Investors look at
       trends too, and this is a trend. That and the US market over
       saturation problem combined with the relative lack of enthusiasm
       for Apple in non-US markets, where Android based products dominate.

       market owns smart phones, and there is an untapped market of a
       billion potential smart phone owners in the rest of the world.
       Plenty of growth going forward for Apple and Samsung.  And
       meanwhile, Apple will continue releasing new products that
       completely revolutionize the landscape, as opposed to having to
       fight it out in just the smart phone market.

 Sorry, but Apple didn't have a weak quarter. It ([591]0+ / 0-)

   was the strongest quarter in the history of Apple.  In fact, the only
   thing you can say is that they failed to meet customer demand due to
   lack of components in the supply chain.  But IMHO, that's a good
   problem to have -- long lines of customers wanting your products.
   Apple's monstrous growth numbers are not due just to repeat sales.  In
   no way do the numbers or the surveys support that.  Furthermore, Apple
   leads this sector in innovation, and their best days are still ahead of
   them.  Apple isn't resting on their laurels.

 Sorry but you're mistaken about some things ([595]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [596]Sharon Wraight

   You are right that Apple and Samsung have different business models;
   Apple has a narrow product line focused on the high end of the market
   while Samsung covers the range and multiple platforms. Samsung has been
   in the phone business much longer than Apple and has a much larger and
   diverse user base of phone customers than Apple. And that's not going
   to change much. None of this is news except when the MSM or tech
   bloggers need a filler story.

   What has changed is the trajectory of both in the smartphone market,
   where Apple penetration of developed markets is reaching the saturation
   point and so their rate of growth is slowing, while Samsung which was
   behind Apple by a significant margin continues to gain smartphone
   share, but not, apparently, at Apple expense since both continue to
   have increasing unit sales, dominant positions and dominant profits.

   In fact, in the US market, Apple is at an all time high with 51% market
   share with much of the growth coming from first time smarphone buyers
   and defectors from Android.

   Outside the US Apple has lower market share total and against Samsung
   but is gaining market. For example, China is now Apple's No. 2 market
   and they sold more than 2 million iPhone 5 in the first 3 days it was
   on sale, a pretty phenomenal record considering the price verses
   purchasing power of the customers, and also given the fact Apple does
   NOT sell through China Mobile which services approx. 60% Chinese
   subscribers, so they have a long way to go.

   Also, Apple app and content sales continue to outpace Android by a very
   wide margin despite Samsung's gain in share and iOS device internet
   traffic (iPhone and iPad) has an even wider margin.

   Regardless, this will not continue indefinitely as Android gains global
   market share converting feature phone uses to the platform, so it is
   inevitable that measures of "Android vs Apple" will show a decline in
   Apple share even as they both continue to enjoy expansion of the
   market.

   So your conclusion that Apple is stuck in a rut of replacement sales is
   not borne out by facts and really kind of a nonsense projection of the
   type of problem faced by Noika when it ran out of road, and something
   Samsung is more likely to face than Apple given the huge, vertical
   nature of it's organization.

   I think  question facing Apple is whether they should broaden their
   product line with lower priced models to win a greater share. If we
   take iPad mini as a clue, I think the answer is yes, but I don't think
   that means Apple will ever go "cheap" and try to cover every market
   segment as Samsung has because that would dilute the Apple brand and
   not produce profits.

   And if we look at Apple's other blockbuster consumer product, iPod, we
   can see they know how to position a range of models and build
   franchise, they later cannibalize themselves.

   Wall Street analysts always over-hype hot companies because that how
   they sell to investors, and punish and fluctuations so they can deflate
   share prices to set-up the next round.

   But the reality is Apple had a strong year and growth in revenue with
   an unchanged margin (13.1%) YoY. That may not please investment
   analysts that want continually increasing profits and stock value, but
   in real terms it's good performance.

 my local museum ([698]0+ / 0-)

   just opened an exhibition on carousel horses and carousels.

   I painted carousel horses for a while professionally, so you know what
   I'm going to do!

   Museums ARE awesome.

   Right many are called, and damn few are chosen.

 love hate ([701]0+ / 0-)

   As a proud owner of a Samsung Galaxy SIII, I've never found a device
   more indispensable, yet at the same time I've never hated any man-made
   device more. I truly despise it and no doubt the stress it causes is
   shortening my life span. I feel insecure without it.  I know this
   comment is confusing but it's a side effect of using the phone.

 shipping? Samsung the shipped the most? ([711]0+ / 0-)

   Who cares? I could ship the most phones. But never sell a single one.
   So what does that number matter, except to the shipping companies and
   their investors?

   Did samsung ship them all to the store, and then ship them all back
   again when they didn't sell? That could explain why they did the most
   shipping.

 Actually, that is good point ([714]0+ / 0-)
       And a distinction one tech blog made; Samsung reports shipments,
       Apple reports sales.

 Lithium Is a Filthy Industry ([718]0+ / 0-)

     So if you've got a place to put a couple of tons of LC, might be a
     good idea to invest.

   Lithium is plentiful in the Earth's crust around the world. But
   extracting it is a filthy business. Huge amounts of pollution and
   destruction of the ecosystem from which it's extracted. Lots of poisons
   for the workers.

   Which is why its production has largely moved to China, where pollution
   and poison is outsourced for the world's tech industries. And where the
   government is using that dominance to manipulate supply in face of
   increasing demand for extra profits - none of which reduce the
   pollution and poison.

   So the Daily Kos on its Sunday front page urges investing in Chinese
   market perversion built on exploiting American consumers and Chinese
   labor and environment.

   Progressive!
