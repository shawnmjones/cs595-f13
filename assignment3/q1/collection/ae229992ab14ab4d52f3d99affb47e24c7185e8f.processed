Elaine Chao, Fox News, and a clarification

   If you watched last night's show, you'll know we ran this segment about
   assorted Republicans who serve as Fox News contributors. Of particular
   interest was Elaine Chao, the Labor Secretary in the Bush/Cheney
   administration.

   IFRAME:
   [3]http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39788177?launch=49067731^890^397920&csid
   =MSNBC_Maddow_Blog&&&height=429&width=600

   In our segment, we noted that Chao "works at Fox News as an on-air
   contributor," in addition to her role as [4]a national chair for Mitt
   Romney's presidential campaign, which began on Aug. 2.

   As recently as three weeks ago, on Aug. 29, Chao was introduced on the
   air as a "Fox News contributor."

   As of right now, her [5]official bio at the Heritage Foundation
   describes her as "Fox News contributor," and her official bio on her
   own website described her as a "Fox News contributor."

   This afternoon, however, Fox News said Chao is no longer with the
   network. Her last day at Fox, the network told us, was Aug. 29. Someone
   probably ought to let Chao know.

   Funny listening to Republicans complain about Leftist Media when Faux
   news has their own in house Right Wing Shills.

   Considering I live in Ohio, and one of those shills is now my Governor,
   and I doubt he would have gotten to be Governor without the face time
   on Faux, and learn how to manipulate the media, well, it just didn't
   work out for us.

   Most of the people I know who voted for Kasich now realize they were
   manipulated, and they are not happy.

   You know, people should be smart enough to see propoganda for what it
   is. If Ohioans were duped by FOX, then good enough for them. The
   liberal media is doing their darnedest to reelect Obama. MSNBC should
   be getting campaign dollars for working for him. They campaigned for
   him in 2008 and they are campaigning for him now. Fox is the only
   station that gives a balance to what all other news stations are
   spouting. If you watch all liberal news, you are uninformed. You should
   choose to watch all sides of the issues so that you can make an
   informed decision on your vote. Why watch a station that shows only
   what you want to hear. Listen and watch others so that maybe you might
   pick up something different and get a little different slant on the
   subjects. The media only recognizes one party and its policies.

   Disgusted, ewwwwwwe. I never thought anyone would be so self loathing
   as to bed a turtle like creature destined to ruin the world's economy.

   craigslist? ewwwwwwe! Match made in heaven and unacceptable in
   Kentucky, way to go, Mitch! eeewwwwwwwe!

   Chao is indeed Mitch McConnell's present wife... the second one.

   The first one got away... must have been that wild night with Harry
   Reid.

   No?

   Look it up.

   WOW!! Everyone here is drinking the Obama Kool-Aid. If you are one of
   the 47% currently receiving US Government aid, and have absolutely zero
   ambitions for you and your childrens' future (i.e., everyone else
   should pay for your to watch TV and eat junk food) then vote Obama. If
   you have ANY desire to work or happen to know someone who works now
   (and pays taxes) then vote Romney. It really is that simple. What do
   you want for the future of the United States of America?

   Mike in Georgia. Isn't that in the former Soviet Union? You speak and
   write very good English considering you come from that part of the
   world. It's ashamed you have all your facts wrong. My son works three
   jobs and was in the National Guard (spent 2 tours of duty in Iraq) He
   has a working wife and three children and he DOES NOT pay income tax
   because his family income falls below the Poverty level.

   Hey Mike in Georgia......I see your state is one of the top ten states
   of percentage of residents who don't pay any federal income
   tax.......and yet your state votes red. So if the Republicans take
   control of the government and cut all the programs that people depend
   on who is going to take care of the people of Georgia? Or will you just
   encourage them to move to a blue state where people care about those
   less fortunate and try to lift them up through the hard times? That's
   how Mitt lowered his unemployment numbers as gov of
   Massachusettes......people left the state because they couldn't find
   work. Another funny thing, my brother did 20 in the military and he
   told me when he got out and got a civilian job it was the first time he
   had ever paid income taxes. So are our men and women serving part of
   the 47%? What about seniors on social security who worked their butts
   off their whole life and now don't pay taxes on their fixed incomes. Do
   they need to get off there butts and get a job? The number of people
   who don't pay income taxes is not equal to the number of people
   collecting government handouts. Don't blame them, blame the tax system.
   There are also people at the top that have good enough lawyers and
   accountants that they have no effective tax liability. Why don't we put
   more energy into creating a fair tax system instead of attacking
   people.

   Chau got kicked upstairs. Rupert Murdoch recently named her to join the
   Newscorp Board of Directors, where she will be invaluable in rubber
   stamping Rupe's use of this public corporation's resources as a
   personal piggy bank for his right wing causes.

   Elaine Chau, wife of Sen. Mitch McConnell, got kicked upstairs.

   Rupert Murdoch recently named her to serve on the Newscorp Board of
   Directors, where she will serve with the other lapdogs, rubber stamping
   Rupert's use of this public corporation as his personal piggy bank
   supporting right wing causes.
