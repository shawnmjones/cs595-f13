[22]Open thread for night owls: The matter with Kansas

   Night Owls
   If you want to form a new, radicalized government, start small.
   [29]It's cheaper.

     When Brownback was elected governor in 2010, there was only one
     group of politicians standing in his way. Surprisingly, they were
     not Democrats - whose numbers in the Kansas legislature had dwindled
     so precipitously as to render them effectively impotent - but a
     small band of moderate Republicans, who balked at the most extreme
     elements of Brownback's agenda and still had enough power in the
     Kansas Senate to gum up the works. And so when the 2012 Republican
     primary rolled around, Brownback and his supporters recruited an
     army of right-wing challengers and targeted the moderates with
     unprecedented alacrity. Not to mention cash: During the primary,
     outside spending from groups like Americans for Prosperity (a
     lobbying group founded by the Koch brothers), the Kansas Chamber of
     Commerce (run by former Koch employees), the Club for Growth and
     Kansans for Life totalled, according to varying estimates, somewhere
     between $3 million and $8 million.

     [...] Of the 22 moderate Senators targeted, only five survived. It
     was a wholesale rout, a bloodbath. After the primary, Brownback told
     reporters that voters made a "clear statement . . . I think what you
     had is, the market functioned on Tuesday."

     "I think Brownback is fascinated by how easy it is to change things
     as governor, as opposed to being one of 100 U.S. senators," a Topeka
     insider with ties to both parties tells me. "The current Republican
     legislature watched the moderates get executed by the Brownback
     machine. They know, and are no doubt regularly reminded of, how
     Brownback destroyed the career of a solid conservative like Dick
     Kelsey. And they know he's capable of killing any one of them."
            _____________________________________________________

   [30]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2002--

   No charges against Padilla:

    Once upon a time, security agencies needed things like "charges," or
      "probable cause" to arrest and detain someone. Thanks to the WOT,
     that's no longer necessary. Case in point: The alleged "dirty bomb"
       suspect that had the press in titters the last two days. While
   headlines trumpeted a victorious blow against terror, the government's
    case against gangbanger Jose Padilla was nothing more than vapor. The
     latest in this bizarre saga? Rumsfeld now admits that the US is not
         going to arrest Padilla. They just want to 'question him'.

    Yet at the same time, in violation of everything this country and its
      Constitution stand for, he is being held "indefinitely". This is
                            getting really scary.

   On today's [33]Kagro in the Morning show, Greg Dworkin brings us a few
   non-NSA happenings, including the collapse of the IRS story,
   Bloomberg's move to cut off big donor funding for Dems against the gun
   bill, and the state of play on immigration reform. Armando weighed in
   on NSA/Snowden legality and constitutionality (and "hero" versus
   "traitor" labeling, as well). Finally, Ted Cruz blocks budget progress,
   demanding assurances no debt ceiling increase will be added in
   conference. But is that even a thing that can happen? Well, yes and no.
   So is Ted Cruz off his rocker? Well, yes and no. But really, yes.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     That guy calling himself "N1ggerkiller" while playing the iPhone
     game "Fun Run" isn't just any racist teenage prick--it's the racist
     teenage prick son of Arizona Senator Jeff Flake!

     And that's not all. Tanner Flake, the "high-school aged" son of
     Arizona's junior senator, has not been using social media best
     practices for a while now, as Buzzfeed's John Stanton discovered.
     Not only does the boy--seen here holding an enormous weapon of some
     kind--go by "N1ggerkiller" on "Fun Run," he calls people "Jews" and
     "faggots" on Twitter:

   ...especially the one which refers to the kid's name, Tanner :)

   Dad is right on it, too:

     Tanner's since taken his Twitter account private, and his dad--a
     goofy-looking survivalist Mormon--apologized in a statement to
     Buzzfeed:

     "I'm very disappointed in my teenage son's words, and I sincerely
     apologize for the insensitivity. This language is unacceptable,
     anywhere. Needless to say, I've already spoken with him about this,
     he has apologized, and I apologize as well."

   When someone is impatient and says, "I haven't got all day," I always
   wonder, How can that be? How can you not have all day? George Carlin

   Recommended by:

   Lawrence O'Donnell seemed to be trying to elicit responses from her
   that would cast Snowden in a negative light. He kept hammering on the
   question of Snowden's lack of maturity and naivete, on his not
   finishing school and his disenchantment with the military. Seems Mr.
   O'Donnell has quite a bit of the authoritarian in him for a
   progressive.

     Yet at the same time, in violation of everything this country and

       because most of the people on my mother's side of the family are
       from Kansas. Mostly Topeka. One worked for a very long time for the
       Repubs in the capital. I think a lot of the sane people moved away
       a long time ago.
       Sad to say that those on that side of the family never really ever
       wanted to communicate. Money means more than family to them.
       It's been extreme there for a long long time. You are right.

 Before revelation ([596]0+ / 0-)

   comes suspicion based on observation. And, no, the wearing of tin-foil
   is not requisite, no matter the knowing public.
   As with paranoiacs who on occasion actually do have real enemies, there
   are real conspiracies. I've long suspected this based on open-minded
   observation of various issues. Edward Snowden has only reinforced this.
   What did he do? He noticed patterns and intelligently investigated.
   Crazy, huh?
   I say this, not to encourage fear or inanity, but, to encourage
   individual awareness and question. Isn't that what an informed

     that definitely includes the Pentagon Papers 40 years ago. Snowden's
     whistleblowing gives us the possibility to roll back a key part of

   in the locations of historic social struggle.  In each case, for all
   its glory and intensity, the progressive-radical force has lost, and in
   the end the area becomes at best utterly somnolent and politically
   apathetic, if not hardline conservative.  Keep in mind that in the
   1890s, Kanss was the living heartbeat of American Populism, that actual
   shooting battles took place in the state legislature, with the united
   arms of the Republican and Democratic Parties eventually defeating the
   People's Party more on the field of battle than at the ballot box.  You
   can find similar social outcomes in places like Lawrence, Mass or
   Little Falls, NY, sites of great militant labor struggles. or the
   mining and logging districts of the northwest, which were once the
   bastions of radicalism in America.
