   Amazon will spend $52 million adding air-conditioning to its network of
   warehouses.

   Updated at 4:30 p.m. ET:Â When protesters at Amazon.com'sÂ ([80]AMZN)
   annual meeting blasted the e-commerce giant for subjecting warehouse
   workers to triple-digit temperatures, company executives were the ones
   feeling the heat.

   CEO Jeff Bezos announced that the company will spend $52 million adding
   air-conditioning to its network of warehouses, the [81]Seattle Times
   reportedÂ and Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako confirmed via email. (The
   company did not provide any additional comment.)Â

   Amazon was criticized last year after a local newspaper in Pennsylvania
   reported how workers at its warehouse there had to endure heat indexes
   of 110 degrees in the summer months â sometimes for as little as $11 an
   hour.

   "During summer heat waves, Amazon arranged to have paramedics parked in
   ambulances outside" in anticipation of workers succumbing to the
   blistering-hot conditions, the [82]Morning CallÂ wrote. On one June day
   alone, 15 workers collapsed from the heat.

   The investigative report prompted an inspection by the Occupational
   Safety and Health Administration, after which the company added fans
   and louvered doors for ventilation, and passed out water and cold
   snacks on hot days. Workers told the Morning Call the measures didn't
   do enough to make the extreme heat bearable.Â

   Roughly 150 protesters convened on Amazon's annual meeting, held at the
   Seattle Museum of Art on Thursday.
