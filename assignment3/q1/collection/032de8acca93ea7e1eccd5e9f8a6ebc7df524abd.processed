   Witnessing [24]Ted, it can be described in one phrase: Seth MacFarlane
   unleashed. Considering the envelopes he pushes on his primetime TV hit
   Family Guy, you may be asking: How far can he go? The thing is with the
   R-rating that Ted brings, it‚s not that MacFarlane is pushing every
   envelope he can. It is more that, as he does on his TV show, the comic
   genius manages to push the limits of hilarity right up to it being too
   much, without ever going over the line of taste. His humor, regardless
   of the medium, always possesses wicked wit, heart and the kind of
   situational comedy that has audiences going, ‚Oh, my God, he didn‚t,‚
   all without ever feeling insulted. Plus, he dishes it out evenly, never
   sacrificing story and genuine emotion.
   [25]Mark Wahlberg Stars in Ted
   Ted stars Mark Wahlberg as John while MacFarlane voices the title
   character -- a teddy bear John received one magical Christmas when he
   was a lonely young boy. With one wish that Ted was real, John awoke the
   next day to a live, walking and talking teddy bear‚¶ i.e. friend for
   life!
   Fast forward decades and Wahlberg‚s John is working at a rent-a-car
   establishment while he and Ted spend their time getting stoned and
   drunk on their apartment‚s couch. But, things are starting to change as
   John is about to celebrate his fourth anniversary with his girlfriend
   Lori (Mila Kunis). Is it time for John to grow up and ask the
   foul-mouthed, sex-crazed and fellow Flash Gordon-loving teddy bear to
   hit the road?
   MacFarlane not only does the impossible as the writer of the film in
   achieving one of the funniest films in recent memory, but also delivers
   in his vocal performance as the titular bear. As fans of [26]Family Guy
   can confirm, the man voices a half dozen characters on that show. His
   Ted is in that vein, but character wise, feels completely original. It
   is impossible to imagine any other voice actor playing the part with
   such panache and fortitude. The filmmaker even can laugh at himself. At
   one point Ted says, ‚I do not sound like Peter Griffin!‚ Well played,
   Seth.
   [27]Ted TV Spot
   Ted TV Spot

   [28]Ted is reflective of that time in a person‚s life where childhood
   ways are let go in favor of meeting adulthood square in the eye, and
   perhaps, even sharing one‚s life with an individual that has us looking
   forward instead of nostalgically back. Ted has eons of soul that one
   would not expect of a raunchy, foul-mouthed comedy. Evidence of that is
   handled with the navigating of the relationship that exists between
   Kunis and Wahlberg‚s characters.
   The pair are uncanny together and despite the audience having an utter
   adoration for Ted, they are too pulling for these two lovebirds to make
   it work. John tries repeatedly to meet Lori‚s expectations of him, but
   somehow Ted riotously interferes. How MacFarlane weaves this web and
   never forgets to have his viewers falling out of their seat laughing,
   is a marvel. If [29]Ted is his first cinematic demonstration of this
   talent‚s abilities on the silver screen, Movie Fanatic believes he has
   the potential to eclipse previous funny film facilitators such as the
   Farrelly brothers and Judd Apatows of the world.

   Wait, you wrote that song? Sang, mixed it, played on it? I rlleay like
   it. It has a kind of McCartney quality, and the chorus stays with you
   nicely I'm very impressed. I am always telling my friends, the guitar
   solo has seemed to have vanished from music entirely. Well done.

   I am so excited to see this movie. I've been a Family Guy fan since I
   was 12 (I'm 20) and I also love American Dad. This movie looks
   absolutely hilarious

   You really need to give the credit also to Alec Sulkin and Welesley
   Wild. They were the screen writers who along with Seth MacFarland wrote
   the movie.
