George Takei, Patty Duke Talk Social Security, Diss Captain Kirk

   By [23]Joshua Cohen April 11, 2011

   george-takei-patty-duke-social-security The original Star Trek debuted
   in 1966. The Patty Duke show began broadcasting in 1963. That makes
   both television series a couple decades shy of [24]retiring and
   receiving full Social Security benefits. The stars of those shows,
   however, are more or less at the age where they can start collecting.
   And they're definitely at the age where they can star in a lo-fi,
   low-budget online ad campaign instructing other age-eligible
   individuals on how they can start collecting, too.

   Late last month, the [25]US Social Security Administration released a
   [26]series of eight promo spots. Those spots feature George Takei and
   Patty Duke dressed in faux Star Trek garb expounding the benefits and
   ease of [27]boldly going to [28]SocialSecurity.gov for all your Social
   Security-related questions and needs.

   [EMBED]

   The videos are out of this world (sorry!) because:
    1. [29]Duke sports a set of Vulcan ears.
    2. Duke and Takei engage in a special kind of tongue-in-cheek,
       back-and-forth banter usually reserved for [30]late night
       advertisements from local car salesmen.
    3. It's kinda ridiculous to think a government organization developed
       an online ad campaign for geriatrics.
    4. It's kinda sweet to think a government organization developed an
       online ad campaign that features at least [31]some semblance of
       cool.

   SocialSeucirty.gov's Boldly Go videos have so far accumulated some
   33,000 views. My assessment is that relatively low number speaks more
   to the social media marketing capabilities of the organization than the
   content of the videos. These are good! And if [32]George Takei as
   Spiderman can rack up 150,000 views, there's no reason [33]Takei and
   Duke making fun of Captain Kirk shouldn't break at least a million.
