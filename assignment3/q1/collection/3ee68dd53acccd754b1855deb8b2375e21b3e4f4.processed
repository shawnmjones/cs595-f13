[22]Scott Brown for president

   Scott Brown on Fox News
   Fixed that one for you, Scott
   From Scott Brown's [29]explanation of why he's considering a
   presidential bid:

     It's 2013, I think it's premature, but I am curious. There's a lot
     of good name recognition in the Dakotas and here - that's pretty
     good.

   By "here," Brown was referring to Iowa, where he did the Iowa State
   Fair--even eating his very first corn dog. But while he may be pleased
   with his name recognition in the state, Des Moines Register reporter
   Jennifer Jacobs [30]reported:

     Few Iowa fairgoers recognized him as he ate his very first corn dog,
     drank a couple beers at the Bud Tent, shot a bunch of photos of his
     wife, Gail Huff, posed in front of the fair's main attractions (the
     butter cow, a deep-fried Oreo stand, the Big Boar) and did three
     local news interviews.

   So actually not very many people knew who he was, but hey, his wife was
   born in Iowa, which makes him pretty much from Iowa. Plus, he's also
   basically from New Hampshire too, which really gives him a corner on
   being a favorite son of the early states.

   Brown [31]told the Boston Herald that he was looking beyond Iowa and
   the Dakotas to gauge potential support.

     I want to get an indication of whether there's even an interest, in
     Massachusetts and throughout the country, if there's room for a
     bi-partisan problem solver.

   Wait, he wants to look to Massachusetts to see if there's room for a
   guy like him to run for president? Doesn't the fact that Massachusetts
   voters gave Elizabeth Warren's 54 percent of the vote answer that one
   pretty clearly?

   Still, let's not write him off just yet. There's is almost certainly
   some entertainment value left to be had in Brown. And plus, even though
   Massachusetts voters may have thrown him out of office after serving
   less than three years, he's still got more experience in high political
   office than Sarah Palin.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [46]Tagging tips - [47]Search For Tags - [48]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   They just look inedible to me, like two slabs of dark brown cardboard

   Looking through the list of food, I couldn't have sat down and had a
   beer and meal with Brown and Wife.  The beer probably wasn't kosher.
   The corn dog?  The butter cow?  The boar?  Ha!  Not likely.

   The Oreos are the only kosher thing on the list.  I'd starve to death
   in Iowa.

 There are two views on the kashrus of beer ([127]3+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [128]itzik shpitzik, [129]lyvwyr101, [130]Not A Bot

       in the Orthodox circles I travel in....
       A few people (tending to the more yeshivish side of things) only
       drink beer with a hecksher, but over 250 beers brewed in the US are
       on the CRC's list of kosher beers.
       Most other people I know drink most unflavored beers, if brewed in
       the US, Canada, or Europe. Flavored beers have other issues, so
       things get more complicated :-(
       The primary kashrus supervision agencies seem to frequently find
       new stringencies to uphold. I tend to the more modern side of
       things, so I'm in the any unflavored beer is OK camp.
       But the food? Yeah, state fair food is hard.... not much kosher
       there :-(

   Recommended by:

   because in both of his Senate runs the Republicons raised money for him
   nationally using every means they had at their disposal.

   So there are people in East Nowhere, North Dakota, that know who he is.

   And his name is well known in hateradio circles because they talked
   about him constantly during the special election in 2010, and rejoiced
   triumphantly when he won.

   Then last year they tried as hard as they could to re-elect him.

   So, sadly, Republicon donors all over the country do know his name.
   The fact that he lost doesn't faze them.

   Plus for some godonlyknows reason they think he is cute (aaugh) and
   will appeal to female voters (blecchh).

   He'd also be good geographical balance as VP for some wingnut at the
   top of the ticket.  Knowing full well that he can't pull in very many
   votes from New England, it would just give them the appearance of being
   moderate that could fool "independent" voters in the middle of the
   country.

   He'd have to go full cray cray to get the nomination and he's not a
   very persuasive speaker.  I don't think he can convince them that he is
   one of them.  He'll have the same problem Romney had:  "no, really, you
   can trust me this time, I really AM as crazy as you, I was just
   pretending to be a moderate so I could win in Massachusetts!!!"

       doesn't include many voters. And every candidate has done some
       national fundraising. So they ALL have the same "name recognition."
       That geographical balance thing was put in the grave over a decade
       ago. It doesn't work. It's outdated. And as commenters have
       mentioned, MASSACHUSETTS enflames Republican voters and they won't

       He was the 41st vote to stop Obamacare.  He was the centerpiece of
       national R fundraising in 2009 and 2010 and a very big name on
       hateradio all over the country.
       You can't say that about a lot of other candidates.
       I'm just saying that he has something to build on.   Not that I
       think he deserves the R nom or can win the R nom.
       And I certainly don't want him to be president!!!

       Semi-nudity sure worked out well for Anthony Weiner, didn't it.
       The media couldn't get enough of printing and reprinting those
       photos, writing about it and making infantile puns.
       On the other hand, wearing diapers didn't seem to hurt David
       Vitter.   While there were no photos in that case, certainly the
       story was out there, but the Republicans and the Republican-owned
       media had no interest in reporting the story more than a day or
       two, at most, well back in the newspaper.  Nor did Mr. Wide Stance
       get excoriated, day after day, in the press when he dropped his
       trousers.  (And FOX, the defenders of our virtue, didn't seem all
       that scandalized about Geraldo Rivera's selfie.)  Of course, the
       media also ignored the emperor and co-emperor who were revealed to
       be wearing no clothes; yes, George and Dick I'm talking about you.)
       So it seems that when a Republican does it, it's just a matter of
       being "transparent" and therefore good.  But when a Democrat does
       it, well that's something else entirely.

   Not really. Somehow he outperformed Romney and Warren underperformed
   Obama by about 5%. I'd love to see Sen. Warren in the WH soon but the
   fact that Brown outperformed the former Gov. of Mass would seem to
   indicate SOME level of interest in Brown, as misguided as it may be.

   I was tuaght that the first rule of strategy is never to unestimate
   your opponent. I think we did that with W in 2000 and 2004 and we are
   still dealing with the results of that.

   Brownis not stupid or fire breathing. He can be very smooth and not a
   total jack ass like the rest of the field.

   He can tack when he needs to and probably apeal to regular, independent
   or undescided voters.

   Being that he is not as douchey looking as other repub makes him more
   dangerous. He could sell the crap and have an easier time getting away
   with it.

   This next part will raise the very devil but, let's face it. Obama did
   not really win re-election the Republicans lost it. If they had put
   someone like Huntsman or Lamr Alexander up against Obama I think the
   resuults could have been very different.

   As to whether the Republicans would nominate someone who does not wear
   a tinfoil hat is another issue.

   We're Facebook friends, mostly. Anyhow, I saw today that she was
   complaining about a family member having problems with a facet of MA
   state bureaucracy, and I was going to commiserate...until she went on
   to say that those problems would have been moot if there was a Gov
   Brown. That he would have fixed all those silly bureaucratic issues
   that crop up in state (and federal) government offices.  After I
   finished hysterically giggling, I read the rest, which described him as
   a "can-do" sort of guy who gets things done, blah blah blah... It
   really shocks me that there really are people who think that he would
   have been a better Senator than Elizabeth Warren, and not just because
   of political reasons, that supposedly Scott Brown is a can-do kinda
   guy. As opposed to Sen Warren, who just sits on her ass, I guess.
   (Sorry, I'm giggling again...)  The other part I didn't quite
   understand was: Brown ran for governor?  Did I miss this?  I'm in NY,
