[24]Ninety-two lawmakers want president to seek congressional okay for a
military intervention in Syria

   Marie Harf, State Department spokeswoman
   Marie Harf briefs reporters at the State Department
   about Syria on Wednesday
   As of Wednesday afternoon, 92 lawmakers--76 Republicans and 16
   Democrats--have [30]signed a letter demanding that President Obama seek
   congressional approval before taking any military action in Syria.
   Circulated by Republican Scott Rigell of Virginia, the letter states:
   "We stand ready to come back into session, consider the facts before
   us, and share the burden of decisions made regarding U.S. involvement
   in the quickly escalating Syrian conflict." Congress is not scheduled
   to be in session again until Sept. 9.

   Depending on who is doing the interpreting, presidents either are or
   are not required to obtain congressional approval in advance under the
   40-year-old War Powers Act for any military interventions unless the
   United States has been directly attacked. But the interpretations are
   murky. Rigell said the administration's intervention in Libya in 2011
   was unconstitutional because the president did not get congressional
   approval. The White House has argued that it did not require such
   approval because the intervention was a NATO action.

   An imminent military intervention against Syria was strongly
   [31]telegraphed in a short, harsh speech by Secretary of State John
   Kerry on Monday. Unnamed official sources told reporters earlier this
   week that an attack could occur within days, perhaps as early as
   Thursday.

   Such an attack, various anonymous in-the-know speculators have said,
   could be launched solely with Tomahawk missiles based on the four U.S.
   destroyers now positioned in the eastern Mediterranean, and possibly
   from submarines presumed to be there as well. Or it could include
   missiles and fighter-bomber attacks. Those require far more preparation
   and support, and they run the obvious risk of U.S. casualties even
   though intelligence experts believe the Syrian air defense network is
   highly vulnerable to pre-emptive strikes.

   A closed-door meeting of the five permanent members of the U.N.
   Security Council ended today without any action being taken on a
   U.S.-backed British proposal to condemn the use of chemical weapons by
   the Syrian government and to intervene militarily with the
   international body's imprimatur to protect Syrian civilians from
   further attacks.

   One person at the meeting was cited by the Associated Press as saying
   the Russians were the reason no action was approved. Under a dubiously
   worded headline, the Los Angeles Times [32]said the Russians had
   "torpedoed" what the newspaper called "a final Western effort" to get
   U.N. approval. It reported that the United States had obtained
   endorsement from NATO. The endorsement doesn't mean the alliance will
   participate, however.

   [33]3:56 PM PT: The latest count on Rigell's letter from the Washington
   Post is [34]98 Republicans and 18 Democrats.

   Please read about further developments in a possible war with Syria
   below the fold.

   At a [35]press briefing Wednesday, State Department spokeswoman Marie
   Harf [36]told reporters:

     "We see no avenue forward, given continued Russian opposition to any
     meaningful Council action on Syria."

     "We cannot be held up in responding by Russia's continued
     intransigence at the United Nations, and quite frankly the situation
     is so serious that it demands a response," Harf continued, hinting
     that Washington would proceed with its plans regardless of the
     Security Council's outcome.

     Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his British counterpart
     William Hague that it was necessary "to wait for the results" of the
     UN chemical weapons team's results.

   The spark for intervention occurred Aug. 21 when a chemical attack
   occurred in an area outside Damascus. Nobody denies that a chemical
   attack took place--not leaders in Russia or Iran who back the Syrian
   regime, nor the regime itself. But the Syrian government, which has
   been fighting against a divided opposition since March, claims the
   rebels launched the attack that some sources now estimate killed 1,300
   people and injured perhaps another 2,000. Harf said it is the view of
   U.S. officials that none of the rebel groups, neither the main
   opposition nor an extremist fundamentalist faction, have the capability
   to undertake chemical attacks of the sort now being investigated by a
   U.N. team.

   Harf repeated what she and other U.S. officials have said previously
   about the U.N. inspections being largely irrelevant because they are
   only being conducted to determine whether there was a chemical attack
   and the extent of its impacts. Inspectors have no mandate to decide
   culpability in the matter.

   In terms of when intervention might actually occur, Harf said the
   administration is operating on "our own timeline."

   The British have indicated they are on board with intervention, though
   not quite as avidly as the French. Foreign Secretary William Hague
   [37]said Wednesday after a meeting of Britain's National Security
   Council that the United Nations should:

     "shoulder its responsibility" over Syria; if it failed to do so,
     however, Britain and and its allies would act on their own.

     "This is the first use of chemical warfare in the 21st century," he
     said. "It has to be unacceptable. We have to confront something that
     is a war crime, something that is a crime against humanity."

   That's not strictly accurate. In November 2004, as the U.S. later
   admitted, white phosphorus was used in the second battle of Fallujah in
   a manner that violated the [38]Chemical Weapons Convention.

   Although Hague said Britain will act, there's the matter of two votes
   that parliament must take before that can happen. On Thursday, the
   House of Commons will give a thumbs up or down on a [39]motion
   deploring the use of chemicals and seeking a U.N. resolution in support
   of taking action to protect Syrian civilians. But even if that motion
   is approved--which is likely given that the Labour Party has retreated
   from its earlier withdrawal of support for it--a second motion
   authorizing action must be voted upon after the U.N. inspectors present
   their report. There's no chance that report will be ready before early
   next week.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       But in this case, I am extremely skeptical of Congress - read that
       the repubs in Congress - would be acting in good faith.
       Since repubs seem to disagree with Obama up to and including the
       color of the sky, I am deeply skeptical that they would have a
       meaningful discussion on this issue. And the fact that the repubs
       are not zooming back to D.C. to have this discussion NOW - no,
       let's wait a few weeks to Sept 9th - only reinforces my skepticism.
       Mind you, I believe Congress SHOULD have a meaningful discussion on
       this issue and should vote en masse one way or the other. But I
       just don't see the repubs treating this serious issue, well,
       seriously. Repubs are WAY more likely to just use this issue as
       another attempt to shit on Obama - and, once again, make USA look
       stoopid on the international scene.
       Color me deeply skeptical. Too bad, cause I really would like to
       see a meaningful debate in Congress.

       Let's not kid ourselves and think that the GOP aren't hoping that
       he gets sucked into some unpopular war as a way of taking control
       of Congress in 2014.
       When there are no good options in Syria, the best option is

       ... from a comment yesterday by Domestic Elf:

     [306]A small window here to pin this on Russia
     In the immediate aftermath of the chemical attack, while the
     horrible images are still circulating, the U.S. has an opportunity
     to flip this narrative - instead of the world calling for the U.S.
     to act, the world needs to be calling for RUSSIA to act.

     Over the next 24-48 hours, every U.S. statement should demand that
     Russia rebuke Assad directly in a serious and meaningful way. If
     they want to continue to support him, and obstruct us at the UN in
     the face of this violation of international law, then Russia needs
     to own this chemical attack.
     If Putin won't offer more than a lukewarm denunciation of the
     attack, then call for a widespread boycott of the Olympics. We are
     only months away and dozens of countries boycotting Putin's Olympics
     because he supported using chemical weapons against children would
     be very bad optics for him.
       I asked her/him to do a diary on the idea, but don't know if it
       will happen.

       Is a brilliant idea.
       Obama will be attacked for it as weak or something. 'Only a
       community organizer would propose a boycott in response to a
       chemical attack.' But, a friendly reminder, Obama will be attacked
       no matter what he does.
       And, this could work. It's Russian material support more than Iran
       that's keeping Assad going. Forcing Russia to stand down could
       change realities on the ground very quickly.

       we would have to commit to a major military action, not some
       "small, surgical" strikes.
       That is because even if we take out Assad, we then leave the
       various rebel groups in control of the weapons. These same groups,
       some of whom are linked with/supplied with soldiers from al-Qaeda,
       have been fighting amongst each other, killing each other and
       civilians as well. If instead of focusing on Assad, we focus on the
       weapons themselves, we have other problems.
       To actually control Syria's chemical weapon arsenal, to prevent the
       use or proliferation of chemical weapons, would require destroying
       portions of Syria's stockpiles; hindering its movement or by
       seizing key installations. This would require a massive US
       involvement, including troops on the ground, for an indefinite
       duration.
       This is not my opinion -- this is the assessment of the US Chairman
       of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey when he laid
       out potential military options in Syria, with the most
       authoritative assessment of the military options as seen by the
       Pentagon that is available in an unclassified form in a letter to
       Senator Carl Levin from mid-July. [372]BBC article
       Anybody who thinks we can quickly or simply achieve our goals in
       Syria, I fear is vastly mistaken.

 I don't know enough about CW to know for sure ([382]0+ / 0-)
       but maybe it is possible, depending on the chemical and in what
       form it is being stored, that a specific type of bomb would
       vaporize it immediately without dispersing it into the air or
       leaving it on the ground to be contacted by people before it
       dissipated. I am sure we have some Kossacks who might know.
       But even if that were true, Dempsey's assessment made it sound like
       it could not be done just through air strikes.

   Before the bombing starts? What a concept!

   I'm not a fan of the obvious double standard for this President vs. his
   predecessor. But I am a big fan of getting rid of the supposed blanket
   "anytime the President wants to go to war, that's fine with us"
   resolutions. And at this point, anything that slows down the rush to
   bomb someone, somewhere, for something or other seems like a good
   thing. A real Congressional hearing and then real debate on the floor
   before a vote would be a joy to behold.

   An article on Commondreams.org, I think, points out that the US
   opposing the Syrian government would put it on the same side as
   al-Qaeda. . . . I'm sorry to agree with Newt Gingrich and other
   right-wingers on anything, but on this one, there's considerable common
   ground and common sense.

   When adults are told to sit down and shut up and treated like backward
   children, that's the time to demand answers.

   I lost friends in Vietnam; mercifully, my relatives all came home alive
   and unharmed, but people I went to high school with (some my brother's
   classmates), and all known to everyone in the super small school and
   community where everyone literally knows everyone else, died in, or
   because of, Vietnam.  Recently I was doing some genealogy research on
   Ancestry, saw there was a new database added of Vietnam casualties, ran
   their names..., and when they popped up with info on where they were
   killed, the hurt came washing back, just as fresh as it did almost 50
   years ago when they died.

   In this latest incarnation of stupid wars based on lies, my youngest
   nephew did two tours of duty in Afghanistan and missed out on the
   babyhoods of two of his four children, and the two eldest forgot him
   while he was there the first time.  During the last tour, the recruiter
   came around and asked if he wanted to reenlist in the guards, and was
   promised a bonus.  Nephew said "There aren't enough zeros on that
   amount," and when he came home that was that.  Previous to all of that,
   he was with several groups of guard units who helped people during a
   couple of episodes of flooding of the Red River of the North (for that,
   I was very proud of him and the others for helping their neighbors, so
   to speak - for service in Afghanistan, not so much, since we didn't
   belong there).  Mercifully, Nephew came home unharmed.

   No more fucking wars based on lies, dammit!!!

     As always when intelligence is involved, I wonder what the President

   Obama can, and he MUST tell us what he knows regarding Syria.  None of
   this hiding behind "classified" or "secret" info...!!!  We do not,
   after all, have a dictatorship (altho with all the corporations doing
   so many governmental duties, we damned sure have a fascist state going
   in all but name).  If he does not tell us, he should be impeached.

   I'm sorry, but I don't buy the false notion that intelligence regarding
   war has to be kept from us.  We are not children who can't know Santa,
   the Easter Bunny, or the Tooth Fairy are not real.  Our Constitution
   does NOT provide for a secret government making secret decisions or
   secret policies behind the scenes of the public government that our
   Constitution was written for.

   We have not YET illegally or unconstitutionally attacked Syria, but in
   order to give an educated answer, WE THE PEOPLE need to be FULLY
   INFORMED as to what reasoning goes into decisions like going to war for
   no good reason whatsoever.

   WE THE PEOPLE cannot make fully informed decisions about anything,
   including how to cast our votes, without first being fully informed
   about EVERYTHING that goes into a congressional vote either in the
   Senate or the House.

   The secrecy crap was done away with when Dumbya and Dickie left office.
    Obama promised transparency.  It's long past time for him to live up
   to that promise.

   Syria has NOT attacked the US (like Japan did at Pearl Harbor when they
   jointly declared war against the US, so we then had to turn around and
   our Congress Critters then had to vote on a defensive war).

   No attack on US soil by Syria..., no reason for the US to drop bombs on
   Syria.

   Period.

   I have no idea why Syria has internecine strife..., and I no longer
   care.  I just care that the US STAYS OUT of the whole matter.  Let them
   figure it out.

   Avoid a war altogether:  Do NOT sell ANY weapons of ANY kind to ANYONE.
    If they must fight, let them fight their wars without bullets or
   bombs, but with sticks and stones (less fatal than bullets and bombs,
   altho if enough stones are thrown, they can kill).  When they get tired
   of fighting, they'll sit down at the table like civilized people and
   discuss peace.

     The President does not have power under the Constitution to
     unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does
     not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.

       Candidate Obama said the darnedest things...

     2. In what circumstances, if any, would the president have
     constitutional authority to bomb Iran without seeking a use-of-force
     authorization from Congress? (Specifically, what about the strategic
     bombing of suspected nuclear sites -- a situation that does not
     involve stopping an IMMINENT threat?)

     The President does not have power under the Constitution to
     unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does
     not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.
     As Commander-in-Chief, the President does have a duty to protect and
     defend the United States. In instances of self-defense, the
     President would be within his constitutional authority to act before
     advising Congress or seeking its consent. History has shown us time
     and again, however, that military action is most successful when it
     is authorized and supported by the Legislative branch. It is always
     preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any
     military action.
     As for the specific question about bombing suspected nuclear sites,
     I recently introduced S.J. Res. 23, which states in part that "any
     offensive military action taken by the United States against Iran
     must be explicitly authorized by Congress." The recent NIE tells us
     that Iran in 2003 halted its effort to design a nuclear weapon.
     While this does not mean that Iran is no longer a threat to the
     United States or its allies, it does give us time to conduct
     aggressive and principled personal diplomacy aimed at preventing
     Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
       Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And
       some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be
       too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise
       cannot see all ends. - Gandalf the Grey

 Everyone forgets: ([689]0+ / 0-)

   Al Qaeda was never more than a little gang of fanatic criminals, many
   of which were not even welcome in their own countries.  They were
   hiding out in the inaccessible mountain region in and around the
   Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

   AQ was NOT speaking for, or on behalf of, any country.  AQ was only
   speaking on behalf of itself - the little gang of fanatic criminals who
   used low-tech weapons to kill a few people and frighten a lot people
   and try to do a lot of personal and property damage.  That's what
   people who engage in guerrilla warfare tactics DO.  [Used to drive
   Caesar and other Roman generals nuts that the European and British
   Celts were very good at those tactics some +/-2000 years ago.]

   The 19 AQ members (most Saudis) who hijacked four planes with
   boxcutters and killed nearly 3000 people while destroying buildings
   were no longer alive; there was no one to "go after."  Had they
   survived those crashes, they could only have been charged with
   felonies: hijacking planes, murdering a very long list of people, doing
   a lot of property damage.  They did NOT start a war by "attacking" the
   US because they did NOT represent anyone but themselves: their little
   gang of criminals.  That whole thing was NOT done and organized by any
   country, or any country's leaders, or any country's military.

   Sending the US military into Afghanistan to find a little gang of
   criminals (none of whom were the actual criminals who had died with
   their victims) was like using a bomb to go after a mosquito - and just
   as effective.

   Illegally and unconstitutionally invading Afghanistan and then the
   misdirected, illegal and unconstitutional invasion of Iraq was the very
   height of stupidity.

   I kept waiting for someone to say "Wait!  Wait!  You're going about
   this all wrong!  The Constitution does not provide for AUMF nor for an
   invasion of any country without a declaration of war by Congress!!!!
   Stop!"

   AQ was never more than a small disaffected and deranged group of
   fanatic criminals.  The most that should have happened is gather a
   group of international law enforcement personnel to go after them...,
   but the remaining AQ members didn't actually DO the crimes anyway.
   Those 19 individuals were already dead.  There was no one left to put
   on trial.

   the imminent use of chemical weapons against a significant number of

   Congress's better recourse if it objects is the power of the purse, and
   the outcome of Congress not passing a declaration of war is simply that
   a formal state of war wouldn't exist -- but it's not clear one could

   the territory.

   The best argument for Congressional consultation is more voices are

   one damning the President and calling him a dictator for bombing
   without Congressional approval if he acts without Congressional
   approval, and one calling the President a coward if he indicates he
   won't act without Congressional approval first before taking any
   military action, even as they call for him to call Congress back to
   debate the matter.

   This is why I would hesitate, as a Democrat, to sign any "bipartisan"
   letters on Syria right now and would make my case directly to the White
   House that he should call Congress back into session, and my own
   position on the matter clear. The bad faith. I wouldn't trust for a
   second that my signature wouldn't give bipartisan cover to a later
   political hit.

   We are dealing with a Republican Party that is almost entirely fueled
   by bad faith. No matter what the President does, or decides, the GOP is
   ready to condemn whatever the choice is.

       Only Congress has the power to declare war. It is in the
       Constitution. The UK cannot do anything until the UN report...and I
       don't know that the rest of Europe will go before the US and UK do.
       So why not reconvene Congress and put it before the House and
       Senate?
       As for Boehner, he cannot call the Senate into session. Only Harry
       Reid and the President have that power. So he can argue it would be
       pointless to call the House as the Senate isn't there to hear
       testimony/vote/etc. I'm not saying that it's right, just that it
       gives him a way to point at Democrats and say "They aren't doing

       Our HUMINT in Iraq got rolled up when Clinton tried a coup, IIRC

       That is, there may be some very damning evidence - not lies, real

       Or not.
       We just don't know, which is why calling Congress into session and

 But the NSA/CIA/etc were not in any danger at the ([968]0+ / 0-)
       time of being defunded/repurposed/etc. If anything, their
       motivation to lie was because Bush didn't want to hear anything
       that contradicted his ideas.
       I do not believe Obama to be the same. However, the NSA has been
       exposed...and some are questioning their value given the overreach.
       This is the perfect opportunity to prove to the President that they
       are not only valuable, but they can be a humanitarian force as
       well: They are proving war crimes of another power against its own
       citizens!
       Given that they could have a secondary agenda (providing proof for
       their very existence) would it not be reasonable for them to lie?
       After all, it took years to determine that George W Bush had misled
       the public...and by nature the President will take the fall, not
       the agencies under him. There would be murmuring about those who
       had misled the President...but most likely those responsible would
       have been swept away by a new President (Democratic or Republican)
       leaving the agency with its power.

 I agree with you on a Democratic letter ([1009]0+ / 0-)

   but my answer isn't exactly going to make anybody happy.

   This is another case where it seems that the Democrats who signed the
   letter are in "me too" mode, and that the rest of the Democrats who
   haven't come up with their own letter are in their own follower mode.
   They are waiting to react to the White House rather than taking the
   lead and the initiative. I think they don't want to be seen as calling
   the President out, frankly.

   You can stand on your own principles, strongly, without aiding the GOP
   in sandbagging the White House.

   There is no reason that the GOP, with all the bad faith that is written
   all over their faces all the time, should be allowed to turn a blatant
   act of needling a Democratic  President they hate into something it is
   not, a principled bipartisan call to respect the Constitution.

   It's political, as well as moral, malpractice.

       weapon using its incendiary qualities against personnel:

     But the Pentagon was caught in a lie after it was revealed that an
     official Army publication called Field Artillery magazine had
     disclosed that the Army had in fact used white phosphorus as a
     weapon.

     The magazine, in its March-April issue, reported "[White Phosphorus]
     proved to be an effective and versatile munition... [and] as a
     potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines
     and spider holes."  The magazine went on to report "We fired "shake
     and bake" missions at the insurgents, using WP [White Phosphorus] to
     flush them out and HE [high explosives] to take them out."
     On Tuesday, Lt. Col. Barry Venable, another Pentagon spokesperson,
     admitted on the BBC that white phosphorus was used as an offensive
     weapon to target insurgents.  The Pentagon has defended its use of
     white phosphorus by claiming it is a not chemical weapon and that it
     was only used against Iraqi insurgents, not civilians. However even
     this would have been illegall (sic) according to the Army's own
     rules of combat. In 1999 the Army published a handbook that read,
     "It is against the law of land warfare to employ WP against
     personnel targets."

   that WP can never be a chemical weapon because its toxicity is entirely
   contingent on its inhalation as a gas.

   Assuming this admittedly tortuous is true, all it does is demonstrate
   that (1) the definition of "chemical weapon" is outdated and greatly in
   need of revision; and (2) we've been parsing in order to obey the
   letter but not the spirit of the CWC: using "nonchemical weapons"
   precisely for their ability to inflict horrific chemical-weapon-style
   injuries on (usually civilian) populations.

   When I was in college forensics/debate one of the topics was
   environmental pollution. I tried to argue against Zebra mussels. The
   team leaders argued land mines. So, yeah, depending on how you split
   hairs, you can make White phosphorus into something other than a
   chemical weapon. After all, it has more in common with incendiaries
   than with biochemical poisonous agents. But if people want to think
   that any chemical that's toxic should be considered a chemical weapon,
   then diesel combustion exhaust should be considered a contravention as
   well.

   normal hawk / dove positions. America is becoming so polarized that
   even war is becoming first and foremost a partisan activity.

   Anyway, the NSA supposedly intercepted communications within the Assad
   forces - the guy was upset that the chemical weapons had been used
   without proper authorization, IIRC. And that puts another spin on it -
   what if it was the Syrian military, but the desperate act of a local
   commander, not something Assad authorized?

   My advice to President Obama remains: if you have no good choices,
   choose one that doesn't kill people.

   Having said that, Assad will not stop killing people until he achieves
   total victory. Neither will Al Qaeda. The Kurds don't want the whole
   country, just part of it. Hezbollah doesn't want the whole country,
   either, just to keep Assad in power to keep their supply lines to Iran
   open.

   That leaves exactly one side in this thing that can take over the
   country without there being a horrific bloodbath, and the secular
   defectors from the Army are not winning right now.

   Whatever the US does or does not do, there will be enormous suffering
   in Syria.

   Democrat, Republican, or Other, the Constitution clearly says that
   Congress alone shall have the power to declare war. The War Powers Act
   of 40 years ago did not change that. It does not have to be invoked
   except in time of dire and imminent attack. The conscionable thing to
   do, now that we may have days to consider it, is to take the resolution
   to Congress and debate a declaration of war. This is neither pro-Obama
   or anti-Obama. It is a Constitutional requirement.

   Since the War Powers Act cannot be and never has been tested in court,
   it is obviously an unconstitutional dead letter. Do not allow a dead
   letter Statute to make the Constitution a dead letter, as many have
   argued here on Kos. They, and many liberals, simply do not believe in a
   Rule of Law which hems in an Imperial Presidency. They are as
   hypocritical and cowardly as the Republicans who argue the opposite
   when their party is in power.

   No more. No more shall any President wage war unilaterally because of a
   rinky dink asinine War Powers Act that gives him Imperial Power to wage
   war and then dare Congress to decline. It is the very law which turned
   us from a Republic to an Imperial Empire, and Obama has the chance to
   make us understand and follow our own Charter. I am praying he does. I
   am praying he does. Finally, we must have some sanity in government.

   This is the reason I voted for Obama, and many others as well. If he
   betrays this cause, our faith in democracy will be dealt yet another
   hammer blow, and one wonders how many more before the whole house of
   cards simply falls in and we have an Imperial Government to rival China
   and Russia. Obama's inaction on Congressional War Powers restoration
   risks the whole game once and for all.

     SENATOR ROBERT BYRD - To contemplate war is to think about the most
     horrible of human experiences. On this February day, as this nation
     stands at the brink of battle, every American on some level must be
     contemplating the horrors of war.
     Yet, this Chamber is, for the most part, silent -- ominously,
     dreadfully silent. There is no debate, no discussion, no attempt to
     lay out for the nation the pros and cons of this particular war.
     There is nothing.

   I hope that the President we worked for will take the time to utilize
   the judgement of Congress by asking for its judgement.

   Because the imminent or contemplated military action raises the
   question of why the (pre-supposed) use of chemical weapons  by the
   Syrian gov't is such a game changer and across the line, when the same
   gov't is supposedly slaughtering its people with conventional weapons
   for years ?

   International law takes sovereignty very seriously, and does not permit
   interventions into a country's territory without a legal justification
   that can form an exception to the U.N. Charter's broad prohibition on
   international uses of force under  Article 2(4).

   Let's not forget that we violated international law by invading Iraq
   only 10 years ago.

   If and when there is clear documented evidence definitively implicating
   the deliberate use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, should
   we be sticking our nose into this non-international war.

   Lest we forget, it was the Saudis and the Turks (and now US-led
   coalition) that keeps pouring arms in, and allowing radical Muslims
   factions from utside the region in order to extricate Assad and that it
   was this influx of arms which served to escalate the conflict to the
   levels it is at now.

   It is the UN investigation. [1618]Deja vu all over again.

     In an email on Sunday, White House National Security Adviser Susan
     Rice told U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power and other top officials
     that the U.N. mission was pointless because the chemical weapons
     evidence already was conclusive, officials said. The U.S. privately
     urged the U.N. to pull the inspectors out, setting the stage for
     President Barack Obama to possibly move forward with a military
     response, officials said.

   Apparently, the Mossad provided much of the "conclusive" intelligence.

   Using the most updated list ([1647]http://abcnews.go.com/...), I
   compared the signers of the letter and the roll call for Iraq War
   authorization. The two are different--one is a question of
   congressional vs. executive power (You can demand Congress vote with
   full intention of voting yes) and one is an act of war. However, it's
   interesting nonetheless.

   These are the Republicans who voted for the Iraq War on this list:

   Rep. Joseph Pitts (PA-16)
   Rep. Joe Wilson (SC-02)
   Rep. Randy Forbes (VA-04)
   Rep. Frank Wolf (VA-10)
   Rep. Mike Simpson (ID-02)
   Rep. Tom Petri (WI-06)
   Rep. Walter Jones (NC-03)
   Rep. Tom Latham (IA-04)
   Rep. Ralph Hall (TX-04)
   Rep. Frank LoBiondo (NJ-02)
   Rep. Sam Johnson (TX-03)
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (WI-05)

   Two Democrats on this list--Matheson and Peterson--also voted for the
   Iraq War.

   Rep. John Duncan (TN-02) was a Republican "no" on Iraq and is on this
   letter.

   Lofgren, Holt, DeFazio, Capuano, McDermott, Farr, Eshoo, and Blumenauer
   all voted against the Iraq War.

   No one else was there for the vote back then because Congress has had a
   lot of turnover.

       Congressional duties are enumerated already.  There is NO provision
       to abrogate their congressional duties or give them to the
       executive branch, even temporarily.  That is unconstitutional.
       Dumbya got his AUMF because Congress could not legally or
       constitutionally declare war against a little criminal gang that
       had no affiliations with any country, was not part of any country's
       military, was not a political force within any country..., but
       Georgie was throwing temper tantrums and got his own way.  Georgie
       got his MCA '06 because the Gitmo "detainees" are not legal POWs
       because they were members of a little criminal gang, not the
       military forces of any nation (which would have been covered by
       Geneva Conventions)..., so the unconstitutional MCA '06 provided
       for the unconstitutional circumstances under which they could be
       tried, including stripping the prisoner of habeas corpus (not
       suspending it, just removing it!!!).

     [1655]Article I, Section. 8.

     The Congress shall have Power...
     To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules
     concerning Captures on Land and Water;
     To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that
     Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;
     To provide and maintain a Navy;
     To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and
     naval Forces;
     To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the
     Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;
     To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia,
     and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the
     Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively,
     the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the
     Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress...;
       [That last part is what the first part of the Second Amendment is
       about.  Remember, we did not have a standing army when our Founding
       Document was written.  That didn't come until the early 19th
       century.  I do genealogy research and have multiple colonial New
       England lines.  One of the documents genealogists look at for their
       colonial New England ancestors is the ATBA (Able to Bear Arms)
       lists which have the names of the men in the local militia.  They
       had to bring their own weapons and ammunition if/when they did any
       training or if they were involved in any skirmishes (like King
       Philip's War in which some of my ancestors from two locations were

       The US sold the chemical weapons to Saddam Hussein.  That's why and
       how Dumbya and Dickie could be sure Saddam had gassed his people.
       Not sure if Congress sold the chemical weapons or if a private
       corporation did, but since the chemical weapons are designed to
       kill people, did someone think Saddam would have laboratories add
       some chemical to it to render it harmless so they could flavor
       their food with it?  [Read lots of sarcasm in that question.]
       Of course Saddam was going to kill someone with chemical weapons!!!
        Isn't that why the US sold him the chemical weapons in the first
       place?
       If the US sold chemical weapons to Syria, of course someone is

 Do you remember... ([1781]0+ / 0-)

   ... a couple of years ago when Christian Amanpour took over ABC's
   Sunday morning yak fest?

   Her second or third week she interviewed some muckety muck (whose name
   I never remember) and asked how many Al Qaeda members they started out
   with, he hedged his answer, and she changed the question to 'You've
   gotten I don't know how many #2 or #3 Al Qaeda men; how many Al Qaeda
   members are left?  A hundred? two hundred, three hundred?'  "Fewer than
   100" was his answer.

   Other AQ members have allegedly been killed since then.

   The Al Qaeda name is bandied about because it's the only criminal gang
   name that anyone knows since Dumbya got so much mileage on the name
   when he was first trying to brainwash us into being scared shitless of
   ghosts in the closet, and it's still used in place of "Oogley Boogley
   Boo!  The Ter'rists are coming! The Ter'rists are coming!"

   With the name Al Qaeda and phrases like "Al Qaeda-like groups" [being
   the only equivalent we understand], Moronic Media and politicians make
   it seem like these groups are an armies of several million strong.

   I suggest we get hard numbers and stop thinking in terms of
   super-inflated millions that do not exist.

   Incidentally, lalo, I totally agree with you!

   I'm sick of attempts to steer this nation from principles evolved in
   The Age of Reason to hallucinations derived from illiterate herdsmen. ~

   Settled law: the president can do what he wants militarily for 60
   days.. because the congress long ago ceded that power.

   No president of either party is going to cede that power back.

   "Boycott them!" etc are the "solutions of the very comfortable, very
   safe who care only about how this makes them feel. Full stop

   The president has been a collossal failure and sellout imho.. but on
   foreign policy and war he has been right from day one. This is the one
   area in which he is a competant leader. We should give him some trust.

   i find it hilarious the people acting like cultists about extremist
   social issues  are the ones attacking the hardest on the one area the
   obama has been excellent at.

 This isn't a question of approval of the action ([1794]0+ / 0-)

   It's a question of the legitimacy of the President's power to act
   without Congressional approval.

   I am glad to see that some of the chickenhawks like Marsha Blackburn
   (TN-07) are supporting accountability, especially after the blank check
   they gave Bush all those years.

   This seems to me to be the right course of action, taken for the wrong
   (i.e., political) reasons.  Nevertheless, let's take a vote.

   And while we're at it, we can take a vote on a jobs bill.  And raising
   the minimum wage.  And a carbon tax.  And closing Gitmo. And approval
   of presidential appointees.  (Yeah, I know those last two come from the
   Senate... but still.)

 So often a woman spokesperson ([1797]0+ / 0-)

   one would think women were equal with men. But I think women are
   exploited to put a more reasoned inference, for example, if a woman is
   calling such things as war, it is expected to be taken as being less
   offensive action. Frankly I think women ought to stop being pawns for
   war-toting men and I'd like to hear more many more, come out and plain
   out chastise them for their warmongering.

 Can you enlighten me? ([1800]0+ / 0-)

   Russian war ships and a submarine are on their way to the Syrian
   region, US war ships are already there, whoever wants to bomb whatever
   over there, wants first to wait for some lonely UN inspectors to
   confirm that chemical weapons have been used, though nobody can
   determine who used them. So now they (Obama and Cameron) get cold feet
   over their own hawkishness and they play a wait-game. Waiting for what?

   Is this a situation where people start war activities because neither
   Putin, nor Obama, nor Assad want to lose their face?

   I mean most wars are started for totally idiotic reasons. This will be
   another one of that sort?

   If they don't want to looe their faces, I will looe my faith, that's
   for sure.

 This is a nightmare slowly unfolding before our ([1803]1+ / 0-)

   very eyes.

   This is the key to the propaganda this administration is now engaging
   in:

     Harf repeated what she and other U.S. officials have said previously
     about the U.N. inspections being largely irrelevant because they are
     only being conducted to determine whether there was a chemical
     attack and the extent of its impacts. Inspectors have no mandate to
     decide culpability in the matter.

   So, if all parties agree that there was a chemical attack, where does
   this then equal our presumptuous "right" to attack whomever we wish?

   IF the UN is only there to confirm an attack occurred, then does this
   mean our government can attack Canada or Australia???  That it can
   unilaterally decide whom they wish to blame for it???

   WHY isn't the UN there to determine who did it???  Who sent the UN
   in??? Did we give them their "mandate"???

   This is Iraq all over again!

   Let's hope more Democrats stand up to these NeoCons that have
   infiltrated our government!
