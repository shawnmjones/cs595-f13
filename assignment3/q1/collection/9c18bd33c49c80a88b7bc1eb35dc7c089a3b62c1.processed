[23]This week in the War on Workers: Fast food strikes to expand

   Striking fast food workers hold signs saying
   Fast food strikers [30]aren't going anywhere, Josh Eidelson reports:

     In a Monday interview in her Washington, D.C., office, Service
     Employees International Union president Mary Kay Henry told Salon
     that SEIU members "see the fast food workers as standing up for all
     of us. Because the conditions are exactly the same." Henry was
     joined by SEIU assistant to the president for organizing Scott
     Courtney, who said to expect "a big escalation" from fast food
     workers in "the next week or 10 days." Two weeks after one-day
     strikes by thousands of employees in the growing, non-union,
     low-wage industry, Courtney said, "I think they're thinking much
     bigger, and while the iron's hot they ought to strike. No pun
     intended."

   What's the long-term game plan? Well, it's not completely settled, and
   there are several avenues to improvement in fast food jobs:

     A source who took part in a private SEIU meeting with allies last
     week in Las Vegas said that the union presented two tracks under
     serious consideration for transforming the industry. First,
     escalating pressure on fast food corporations - McDonald's, Burger
     King and Wendy's, in particular - with the goal of reaching a joint
     agreement under which the corporations would cover the costs of
     improved labor standards in their stores. And second, a legislative
     push for local living wage laws requiring improved compensation for
     fast food workers. Because most cities lack the legal authority to
     mandate higher wages for jobs that aren't publicly subsidized, that
     push would involve statewide ballot measures in 2014 to allow cities
     to hike private sector workers' wages.

     Asked about that account, Courtney - a key strategist in the
     campaign -- characterized the Las Vegas discussions as preliminary
     and hypothetical. He told Salon that there's "a whole package of
     things" that could press the industry to change.

   Continue reading below the fold for more of the week's news in
   education and labor.

   Education
     * Philadelphia high school teacher Daniel Ueda doesn't just teach in
       the classroom during the school day, he oversees an award-winning
       student robotics team. [31]Here's what he faces thanks to the
       massive education cuts hitting Philadelphia:

          + I am being asked to take a 13% pay cut.
          + All funding for robotics programs including teachers' salaries
            have been cut.
          + The district is seeking the power to move teachers from school
            to school.
          + I am being asked to work a longer work day.
          + We have been left with 1 nurse for 2500 students.
          + All guidance counselors have been laid off, eliminating
            opportunities for scholarships and making the college
            application process virtually impossible for my students.
          + I am being asked to switch from Physics to Math, take an
            additional class, and teach at least three different kinds of
            classes, all in violation of the current contract and all due
            to layoffs and budget constraints.
          + I am being asked to sacrifice my preparation periods for
            school operations.
          + Schools may not open on Sept. 9th.
          + Partial or full union strikes are looming.

     * A [32]lawsuit to keep 49 Chicago schools open faces a setback, but
       presses on.
     * [33]Fort Wayne school board votes to disregard Bennett A-F grades.

   A fair day's wage
     * [34]Will domestic workers finally get minimum wage protections?
     * [35]Ban tipping, make more money?
     * [36]Caregiving is work, and must be recognized as such, even when
       it's for a family member.
     * A unionist's message to the AFL-CIO: [37]Let's talk about building
       a movement.
     * When we talk about the work-life balance, Sarah Jaffe asks,
       [38]does "life" just mean more work for women? In a recent New York
       Times piece, for instance:

     [T]he women who did manage some sort of "work-family balance" seemed
     to have little time for anything else. Many of the former "opt-out"
     women she spoke with had opted back in, and while these well-off
     women had slid more or less successfully back into the workforce,
     they now had new forms of guilt. One woman lamented the loss of
     travel and shared interests with her husband as she juggled her
     family responsibilities with her new career. "They spent their
     evenings on separate floors, she downstairs in the kitchen, on her
     computer, catching up on the work she missed during her hours of
     caring for the children; he, upstairs, watching TV alone," Warner
     wrote.
       Too often, for men there's work and there's leisure, while for
       women there's work, family (work), and leisure. Against that, Jaffe
       argues:

     A gendered demand for leisure would argue that women's time is as
     important as men's, whether we are spending it parenting or reading
     a book or lying on a beach. It would take into account the
     racialized and classed expectations of different groups of women,
     and argue that low-income women deserve time off too (and it would
     argue that they deserve to make enough money to enjoy that time.) It
     would point out that what is earned vacation for white women is not
     "laziness" in women of color.
     * Mine workers are still [39]fighting Peabody Energy for a fair
       retirement.
     * [40]A judge has ordered a 60-day cooling off period before BART
       workers can strike, against the wishes of the unions:

     John Logan, an assistant professor and director of labor studies at
     San Francisco State, reports that BART's negotiating strategy from
     the beginning has been a classic example of "surface
     bargaining"-going through the motions of bargaining with no
     intention of reaching an agreement.

     From the beginning, Logan writes, BART has not shown an interest in
     real bargaining. BART delayed opening negotiations until mid-May
     instead of April as the unions requested.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [60]Civil
   Rights, [61]Community, [62]Congress, [63]Culture, [64]Economy,
   [65]Education, [66]Elections, [67]Energy, [68]Environment, [69]Health
   Care, [70]International, [71]Labor, [72]Law, [73]Media, [74]Meta,
   [75]National Security, [76]Science, [77]Transportation, or [78]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([79]California, [80]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       I hope these recent actions mark an important awakening of the
       spirit of collective action. I support all of it with no
       reservation. Corporations are making billions off the backs of
       their workers and giving little back and the rest to shareholders.
       Even executive bonuses are a drop in the bucket compared with
       dividends. Where is it written that stock price must be maximized
       at all costs? It is a rather diseased and shortsighted way of
       running a company.

          [142]Orinoco, [143]Mostel26, [144]DSPS owl

   A law requiring set schedules is needed.  It isn't fair to keep
   fast-food workers "on call" or to vary their schedules so much that
   they can't keep another job or take night classes or make doctors'
   appointments or plan an outing with their families.  These kinds of
   things make life in retail and food service unnecessarily miserable,
   and they certainly don't help the businesses cut costs or retain
   qualified workers.  We need to focus on making life more stable and
   predictable for workers, and that isn't just about the paycheck.

   As a retired NYC teacher, I remember 1975 and the city trying to do the
   same as Philly, we stopped that with a strike--even though such a
   strike was illegal.  Labor never succeeds without applying
   pressure--never.  Which brings up the fast food workers.  Until they
   organize into a regional--or national-- union, they will fail.  This is
   occupy Wall St --looks great, accomplishes little.

   While fast food workers face pauper wages and miserable working
   conditions, it is only a difference in degree rather than kind in the
   conditions faced by any non-executive class worker in this country:
   teachers, truck drivers, mechanics, office workers, retail clerks,
   Warren Buffet's secretary... you name the industry and the worker, they
   have a similar story to tell.

   I hope the SEIU thinks outside of their Service Employees mandate to
   see that this also encompasses all of the so-called 'middle class' in
   this country, who may have more amenities than service workers, but are
   still one paycheck away from financial disaster and face working
   conditions just as daunting and miserable.

 The problem is not the minimum wage ([179]0+ / 0-)

   the problem is there aren't enough jobs anymore that can feed a family,
   provide health insurance, etc. Fast food work should be minimum wage.
   It's an entry level job, even for "Sandwich Experts." God bless them,
   but they're taking jobs from your sixteen-year-old neighbor. The 28
   year old's real job was shipped to China, Vietnam or Latin America. The
   major failure of American capitalism is its sellout to unrestricted
   free market capitalism; with the Pan Pacific Treaty capitalism will
   fail America completely. Minimum wage treats the symptom, not the
   disease.

 ...while you do touch on the problem... ([182]0+ / 0-)
       ...that capitalism ALWAYS does whatever it can to make the most
       profit possible, the minimum wage currently is a huge problem.
       We all had minimum wage jobs...and they were entry jobs. The thing
       is the minimum wage today would have to be $9.47 per hour to equal
       the buying power of what minimum wage was "worth" when it was $2.00
       an hour.
       Another HUGE problem is a legal maneuver that George Bush got
       through = changing the status of workers. In our day, if you worked
       more than 40 hours per week, you got overtime pay which was 1.5
       times as much as regular pay. NOW they have simply changed what
       workers are called. They are called "representatives" or
       "associates." Why? Because the law then says they aren't hourly
       employees any more...they are "management." And management is a
       "salaried" position meaning it doesn't matter how many hours you
       work...you don't get overtime pay.
       The world of working minimum wage jobs is NOTHING like it was when
       you and I had those jobs. We could actually do things like save. I
       worked all through high school and was able to save enough to pay
       for my first year's college tuition, dorm and text books. Sure I
       went to a public college, but still I was able to save that much
       money over a three year period of time...and that is because what
       minimum wage paid in comparison to what things cost.
       If the current minimum wage was $9.47 per hour and people were
       getting time-and-a-half pay if they worked over 40 hours a week
       then more folks COULD live and save and get a foothold going in
       another direction. Now minimum wage earners don't have the "luxury"
       we had...
