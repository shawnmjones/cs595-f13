     The Fate of Same-Sex Marriage in California after Perry

     When will the injunction take effect?

     A: When the court of appeals lifts the stay that it imposed on the
     district court's judgment.  The Supreme Court's mandate to the court
     of appeals [37]will not be issued for at least 25 days.  As far as I
     know, however, the court of appeals does not have to wait for the
     Supreme Court's mandate in order to lift its stay of the trial
     court's injunction.  And Attorney General Harris [38]apparently has
     asked the court of appeals to lift the stay as soon as possible.
     Therefore the trial court's injunction will presumably go into
     effect on Monday, July 22d at the latest . . . and perhaps earlier.

   [39]Daily News:

     A jubilant [Edie] Windsor dropped the news that she's supporting
     Democratic frontrunner Chris Quinn when the two appeared together at
     a rally celebrating the big Supreme Court ruling that guts the
     Defense of Marriage Act.

     As Quinn prepared to address the elated crowd outside the Village's
     famed Stonewall Inn, the octogeniarian Windsor jumped up.

     "I was committed to not endorse anyone until there was a decision
     [on DOMA]," she said. "Christine Quinn!"

   [40]Chris Geidner:

     Edie Windsor Talks About Her Victory: "It Just Feels Glorious"

     "I had pretty much the same reaction as almost everyone in the room:
     We were all crying," the marriage plaintiff tells BuzzFeed. Windsor
     and her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, share their thoughts about a
     historic victory.

   More politics and policy below the fold.

   [41]Joan Walsh (2004):

     THURSDAY, FEB 26, 2004 03:59 PM EST
     Winter of love

     Cautious Democrats worry that San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom's
     historic affirmation of gay marriage will help Bush win reelection.
     But as the right squabbles over the issue, his party may well thank
     him in November.

   Lesson learned? Do the right thing.

   [42]Erica Grieder, whose [43]tweets explained and got me through the
   Texas leg debacle, writes it up:

     And Texas's long-suffering Democrats should be excited, because for
     the first time in years they appear to have a realistic shot at
     winning a statewide executive office in 2014.  Wendy Davis , the
     Democratic state senator from Fort Worth, vaulted to national
     attention yesterday over the course of a long filibuster that will
     go down in the state history books. She had been widely considered
     to be thinking about a run for governor before that, but her
     prospects were daunting: in a state the size of Texas, candidates
     generally need a lot of money and a lot of name recognition to win a
     top office. Davis, because of yesterday, suddenly has both-not to
     mention a lot to talk about on the trail. She is rapidly becoming
     the most powerful Democrat in the state since Governor Ann Richards,
     who was elected in 1990 and is the last woman or Democrat to hold
     that post.

     But let's begin at the beginning.

   [44][MSNBC_Headshot_normal.jpg] Wendy Davis: next Texas governor?
   [45]http://t.co/...
   -- [46]@chrislhayes
   [47]Ross Ramsey:

     David Dewhurst's dream ended like a fairy tale: The clock struck 12
     and the lieutenant governor's bid for conservative redemption came
     to pieces.

     Tuesday might have been his worst political day ever, adding speed
     to the political tailspin that began a year ago when he was upset by
     fellow Republican Ted Cruz in the race for U.S. Senate.

     On Tuesday, Dewhurst led the Republican Senate into a loss heard all
     over the country, waiting too long to finally break a Fort Worth
     Democrat's filibuster on abortion legislation and then losing the
     opportunity for a final victory in a procedural quagmire attended by
     hundreds of noisy reproductive rights activists.

     It made Wendy Davis a hero for her side, and Dewhurst a goat for
     his.

   [48]WaPo:

     A group of conservative House Republicans blasted the decisions on
     same-sex marriage issued Wednesday by the Supreme Court as legally
     inconsistent and detrimental to the future of the nation's children.
     One lawmaker pledged to soon file a constitutional amendment to
     reinstate the Defense of Marriage Act.

   That's terrific for Republican rebranding efforts. Keep it up.

   [49]National Journal:

     The Supreme Court ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act doesn't
     close the door on the gay-marriage debate, but Republican leaders
     are saying that the issue is one for the states and not for
     Congress.

     House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement that he's
     "disappointed in the ruling," but he added that "a robust national
     debate over marriage will continue in the public square, and it is
     my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one
     man and one woman."

     Likewise, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said, "I'm
     disappointed in this decision, and the marriage debate will continue
     in the states."

     It's no surprise that the Republican leadership is looking to the
     states. GOP leaders maintained a low profile on the case, even as
     Democrats criticized them for authorizing some $3 million to defend
     the law through the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group.

     Public opinion has also been shifting in favor of gay marriage over
     the past decade. Even the Republican National Committee recommended
     that the GOP be more inclusive of gay voters.

   The bigots will have little support in Congress. Too bad for them,
   though a focus on the states reinforces that the work isn't done.

   -- [51]@morningmoneyben
   [52]Erik Wemple:

     That's not to say, however, that [Bloomberg reporter] Stohr's work
     on the story started this morning at 10:00 a.m. No, he began working
     on the story a month-and-a-half ago, he says. Much of the work
     consisted of thinking through all the intricate legal scenarios that
     the Supreme Court could possibly concoct in deciding the DOMA case
     and the Prop 8 case, which also made news today. The brainstorming
     process, says Stohr, ultimately yielded 18 story ledes and many more
     headlines -- all of which were ready for publication this morning.
     "We had ledes written for what do we say if we had a DOMA ruling but
     not Prop 8," says Stohr, who emphasizes that Asseo and Drummond were
     critical to the effort. "What do we say if we have Prop 8 but not
     DOMA? And what do we say when we have both of them?"

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [64]Tagging tips - [65]Search For Tags - [66]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [67]Civil
   Rights, [68]Community, [69]Congress, [70]Culture, [71]Economy,
   [72]Education, [73]Elections, [74]Energy, [75]Environment, [76]Health
   Care, [77]International, [78]Labor, [79]Law, [80]Media, [81]Meta,
   [82]National Security, [83]Science, [84]Transportation, or [85]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([86]California, [87]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Despite his supposed brilliance (he does have quite a record), he
       bases his decisions on rigidly held views that are emotional and
       derive from rigidly held political and religious beliefs.  As a
       justice of the SCOTUS, he should be using his education and
       rational brain to interpret the law.  To state the obvious.
       TPM had a post of [266]10 quotes from his DOMA opinion.  These,
       along with his comments on the VRA, offer a perfect example of his
       emotional response to questions of law and his complete lack of

       For example. there is are two cases in Texas where a couple that

       court allowed the divorce, another didn't. The Texas Supreme Court
       will have to decide whether same sex couples can be divorced in the
       state of Texas. If it is the case that they can, I believe that
       that would be tantamount to the state of Texas agreeing that same
       sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions are valid marriage
       contracts, which then sets up more lawsuits.

   Much much better than the "its my table" Nancy Pelosi".

   Her response to Bachmann is the most correct ever, and it is that sort
   of perspective that can salvage "politics'.

   tippy-toeing politeness is disgusting, to me, when we have this
   onslaught of numbskulls and capitalist thugs.

   Example:

   I used to work with an MD who was/is just outstanding, became Dean of
   Child Psych at Morehouse School of Medicine. Among things I learned
   from her was "diplomacy' (yes, I actually do have a smidgen).

   I saw her in action on the phone one day after I got a call from an
   area agency and they were being pushy with me about bringing this
   person in IN SHACKLES for a psych eval.

   I remained very polite and when I realized they weren't listening to me
   I had them speak with her.

   First - she said "Hi, you know me we were at such and such meeting, how
   are you today" - all nice.

   She explained neatly that evals cannot be handled like that and we
   didn't have facilities to manage such people.

   That didn't work so she cooly repeated it.

   Then she was silent for a little bit.

   Then the smile disappeared from her face.

   "Look" she said.

    I'll never forget the tone in her voice.

   "You can bring them over if you insist, we aren't seeing them."

   Push will come to shove with certain people because they will make it
   necessary. They want to violate your boundaries. You do not have to
   tolerate it.

   Read Dionne's  "[554]The Supreme Court uses judicial activism for
   conservative ends" after the toasting and resolve to turn out in the
   upcoming elections and the next presidential so that we can win some
   lasting gains.

     The marriage rulings, however, should not distract from the
     arrogance of power displayed Tuesday in Shelby County v. Holder.
     Chief Justice John Roberts's opinion involved little constitutional
     analysis. He simply substituted the court's judgment for Congress's
     in deciding which states should be covered under Section 4 of the
     Voting Rights Act, which required voting rules in states with a
     history of discrimination to be pre-cleared by the Justice
     Department.

     ...

     Whenever conservatives on the court have had the opportunity to tilt
     the playing field toward their side, they have done so. And in other
     recent cases, the court has weakened the capacity of Americans to
     take on corporate power. The conservative majority seems determined
     to bring us back to the Gilded Age.

     concluding with

     It is an inconsistency that tells us all we need to know. This is
     not an argument about what the Constitution says. It is a battle for
     power. And, despite scattered liberal triumphs, it is a battle that
     conservatives are winning.

   Until the TP/GOP is driven to oblivion--and do not just sit back
   waiting for "demographics" as these clowns are working hard to nullify
   that in rulings like Shelby County v. Holder (remember there was a time
   when majority black counties and even Congressional Districts couldn't
   elect a black  or brown face to dogcatcher)--this country is going to
   be jerked around with this sort of crap.

   However, they cannot be allowed to blind people to the fact that with

   gets.

   Four Justices (two conservative, two liberal) are over 75 - which is
   why it's vitally important that the Democratic Party maintains its
   Senate majority and retains the White House for at least another full
   term. Doing away with the routine filibustering of every Democratic

 Fairly simple "figure out how to really change ([634]0+ / 0-)
       things" even though I sometimes despair as "we've" let opportunity
       after opportunity slide. "We" have to turn out in every damn
       election! "We" have to quit the on/off two forward, one and a half
       (sometimes two) backward steps of winning big presidential ones and
       losing Congressional and state ones.
       Establishing what "we" want, and seemingly what an actual majority
       wants, takes long term diligence, not short term enthusiasm. "We'd"
       better get an attention span! An attention span for at least
       another full presidential term, two really needed, that can ensure
       a change in SCOTUS so the mini-me of Thomas and troglodyte radical
       views of Scalia and Alito with the all too clever manipulations of
       Roberts become buried in a lasting new majority.
       The TP/GOP has proven again and again they are a dedicated,
       sometime fanatical "god" driven, minority that will cheat, rig the
       table and do anything else to stack the deck in their favor

       Voter ID is going to be in place for 2014 unless there is a
       successful law suit to top it. That by itself hurts our chances.
       There is also the possibility that the legislature will push a mid
       decade redistricting bill through. They may not touch the
       congressional map yet, but they will almost certainly redraw the
       state legislative maps, giving them tighter control over the state
       house. We have embarrassed them on a national stage over SB5. They
       won't let that happen again.

   I used to have to find a woman who at least liked me, too.

   This really IS good news.

   (It's a joke, folks!
   After open heart surgery, the nurse said, "And you can resume sexual
   intercourse as soon as you feel ready." I said, "Cool. I used to have
   to get consent."
   Language carries its own loopholes that are not present in the minds of
   the speakers. When they're really not present, we can create a joke.)

       ask the doctor if you'll be able to do something you can;t do now -
       such as play the violin.
       They will usually say "yes"
       Then you reply "Cool - I can't play it now!".
       You get extra anesthesia.

 ENDA ([711]0+ / 0-)

   Yesterday after the SCOTUS rulings, Harry Reid stated that the ENDA
   would be coming up for a floor vote in the Senate soon. Assuming all 54
   Democrats support it, plus Murkowski, Kirk, and Portman (maybe), are
   there 3 other Republicans who realize that workplace discrimination is
   a problem and could overcome a filibuster? Collins? McCain? Wait until
   Cory Booker is sworn in?

   Regardless, its probably DOA in the House, unless Boehner wants to
   break the Hastert Rule (which he will never do on gay rights).
