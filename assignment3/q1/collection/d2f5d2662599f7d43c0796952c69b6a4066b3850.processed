More Q&A with Bill

     Bill answered a wide range of questions from viewers during his
     recent live Q&A, but there was not enough time for all of them. Here
     are answers to a few more. Bill will continue answering questions in
     future posts, so keep sending yours via Twitter by using the hashtag
     #askbillg.

   Questions submitted to #askbillg:
   o  Does the Gates Foundation fund projects in the United States?
   o  How do you select and prioritize development projects?
   o  How do you measure the success of the foundation's development
   projects?
   o  How do you talk to or teach your children about the issues you are
   passionate about?
   o  Do you have any suggestions for books that can help us understand
   poverty a bit more?

   QUESTION: Does the Gates Foundation fund projects in the United States?

   BILL GATES: Yes, we are very involved in projects in the United States.
   When we started the foundation, we wanted to tackle the world's biggest
   inequities, wherever they are. Globally, we see the biggest inequities
   in the suffering of the world's poorest people, starting with the one
   billion who live on less than $1 a day. We think our resources can help
   make a huge difference in their lives.
   About 25 percent of our foundation's resources are spent in the U.S.,
   mostly to improve our education system, where we see some of the
   biggest inequities in this country. Only about one-third of U.S.
   students graduate from high school with the skills they need for
   college, even though education beyond high school is important for
   success in today's economy. So we're trying to help make teaching more
   effective, raise education standards, ensure that more students
   graduate from high school and ensure that more college students
   complete their degrees.

   QUESTION: How do you select and prioritize development projects?

   BILL GATES: In the foundation's work outside the United States, we're
   focused first of all on the toughest challenges facing the world's
   poorest billion people. Like not having enough food or having your
   children die before the age of five. Or even if your children live,
   having them suffer debilitating diseases. We mostly pick things that we
   think will have significant impact on the living conditions of the
   poorest.

   Then, we set measurable goals and look for projects that have the best
   chance of helping achieve those metrics. In agriculture, for example,
   we have a goal to help triple farm productivity in Africa. This would
   be a huge increase and would make a big difference.  When we decide
   what agriculture projects to prioritize, we look at the crop that a
   project is trying to enhance, what percentage of farm productivity it
   represents, whether it's feasible to triple the productivity, and what
   impact that would have.

   But some things are more subjective, like the efforts we're supporting
   to enable more people to have decent flush toilets. We haven't done a
   grand experiment, we haven't given some people super nice flush toilets
   and let other people keep their current crummy toilets and then
   measured how big a difference that makes in their lives, just how
   crummy your life is if you have a primitive toilet and your house
   smells and nobody wants to marry your daughters, or whatever. We just
   sort of decided, based on some pretty fundamental human values, that
   people should have a good toilet, and shouldn't have to wait for the
   expensive infrastructure that may never come to the poorest parts of
   cities in the developing world. So we support innovative work to kind
   of reinvent the toilet.

   QUESTION: How do you measure the success of the foundation's
   development projects?

   BILL GATES: It depends on our role and what we're working on. When it
   comes to upstream medical invention, like inventing new malaria drugs
   and vaccines, we are often the largest funder. The U.S. National
   Institutes of Health is the only other really large funder. Measuring
   success is fairly simple. Do we have a malaria vaccine? Do we have a TB
   vaccine?

   When it comes to delivery of health services, like vaccinating people
   or getting AIDS drugs to them, we're part of a larger group that
   includes the Global Fund, GAVI, and governments. We measure success in
   terms of whether the percentage of people who receive services goes up
   and whether the prices of drugs and vaccines go down.

   One of our ultimate objectives is to reduce the mortality rate for
   children under five years old. We want to cut it in half over the next
   15 years. Meanwhile, we look at intermediate measures that we know are
   important to achieving that long-term goal. Did this country adopt the
   new vaccine and administer it effectively, or is it sitting and
   spoiling somewhere along the delivery pipeline?

   QUESTION: How do you talk to or teach your children about the issues
   you are passionate about?

   BILL GATES: One way is just from their traveling with us. When we take
   them to Africa, they see what an urban slum looks like, they see what a
   rural thatched hut looks like. They realize that Americans' housing
   must be expensive. They're curious, so they wonder why it's expensive,
   could that ever change, and how bad is it to live in a slum or a
   thatched hut?

   Like anyone else, when they first see how the world's poorest people
   live, they're a little bit shocked. Wow, okay, this is very different,
   I guess I've taken some things for granted, like running water, a flush
   toilet, grass in the yard instead of mud, enough food every day.

   It helps for them to meet people. If they go to an orphanage and talk
   to some of the kids there, maybe they see that this kid is really happy
   because he just got a crutch to help him walk. They think, "Oh, geez,
   I've never had to worry about something like that."

   They're different ages, but over time they'll learn about the bigger
   issues, and the science involved. They're interested in seeing things
   they're studying in school. My daughter is taking a course on African
   history, so she asks a lot about that. My son is very interested in
   politics, democracy and the unrest in some countries. He's curious
   about why some countries have done better than others, like why Turkey
   is richer than Egypt.

   They have their own interests, things they're passionate about, and we
   try to help them get more information about the things they're
   particularly interested in.

   QUESTION: Do you have any suggestions for books that can help us
   understand poverty a bit more?

   BILL GATES: I recommend [13]Poor Economics, which I reviewed recently.
   It's by two MIT economists who've looked closely at what works and what
   doesn't work in aid projects and fighting poverty. They have a lab with
   many other professors who are gathering scientific evidence that can
   help make aid efforts more effective. They show how poor people
   actually live and what barriers prevent them from climbing out of
   poverty. Their data is quite interesting.  Check out their
   infographics, [14]The World of Poor Economics and [15]The People of
   Poor Economics.
