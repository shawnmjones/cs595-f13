[23]This week in the War on Workers: Raising the minimum wage would increase
prices by how much?

   One of the big arguments you'll hear from low-wage employers trying to
   keep the minimum wage as a poverty wage is that raising it would be bad
   for workers because it would lead to job losses. Sen. Elizabeth Warren
   and Jeannette Wicks-Lim, a research assistant professor at the
   UMass-Amherst (the H is silent, contrary to what you hear here)
   Political Economy Research Institute, both [31]challenge that claim.
   Wicks-Lim tells The Real News that:

     One year, in 2006, we looked at Arizona state minimum wage proposal,
     which was a 30 percent increase in the state minimum wage. At the
     time, it was $5.15, and it was being proposed to be raised to $6.75.
     [...] And what we did is we went and we looked to see how much would
     this cost businesses. We looked at what are the wages of workers at
     the time, how many hours did they work. We added that all up. We
     looked at payroll taxes and how much that would go up for employers.
     [...]

     What we found is, for the average business in Arizona, that the cost
     increase would be less than 0.1 percent. And so if you want to think
     about it in real concrete terms, businesses, by raising their prices
     by less than 0.1 percent, would be able to cover all the costs of a
     minimum-wage increase of a size of 30 percent.

   Similarly, Warren pushed a restaurant owner on the numbers:

     During my Senate campaign, I ate a number 11 at McDonald's many,
     many times a week, and I know the price on that one, $7.19.
     According to the data on the analysis of what would happen if we
     raised the minimum wage to $10.10 over three years, the price
     increase on that item would be about $0.04. So instead of being
     $7.19, it would be $7.23. Are you telling me that's unsustainable?

   Meanwhile, Minnesota is considering raising its state minimum wage to
   $9.95 an hour, and state Rep. Jason Meta is taking a [32]minimum wage
   challenge with Working America, trying to find out a little about what
   it's like to live on $7.25 an hour. As we know from food stamp
   challenges, the fact is that you don't find out the hardest stuff when
   you're just doing it as an experiment for a week--you don't live with
   deep-seated uncertainty, don't worry about what happens if you get sick
   and need something you can't afford on a food stamp or minimum wage
   budget. But the stuff you do learn is very much worth having in the
   policy debate.

   A fair day's wage

       journalists) have an [33]exciting new labor podcast called
       Belabored over at Dissent.

       Services/Allied Waste.
     * Banjo the puppy rescued from the train tracks.
       [35]All together now: Awwwww.

     Last week a 10-month-old poodle-terrier mix was found tied to the
     railroad tracks. An engineer spotted an old man walking near the
     railroad tracks and noticed that the man had left something behind.
     The engineer was able to stop the train in time using his emergency
     brakes and discovered the pooch still alive. The puppy's hero
     remains unidentified.
       The puppy has been put up for adoption at Riverside County Animal
       Services.
     * [36]Reality-type TV continues to have lousy labor practices. The
       Writers Guild of America, West is alleging that Joan Rivers's
       production company and the E! Network have violated wage laws in
       producing the show Fashion Police:

     Writers on the E! Network cable show, in which Rivers and other
     hosts comment on the fashion of celebrities, on Wednesday filed
     complaints with the state Division of Labor Standards Enforcement,
     alleging they are owed more than $400,000 in back wages.

     The complaint follows a similar complaint writers on the show filed
     last week against E!, contending the cable network owed them $1.1
     million in back wages.
     * [37]Hooters allegedly forces out waitress because her brain-tumor
       scar was ugly. I thought that Undercover Boss episode where the
       weenie son of the founder of Hooters was appalled to learn that
       waitresses in the chain weren't always treated very well was
       supposed to have fixed things like that. (Snark. Undercover Boss
       somehow expects us not to notice that the fact that everyone the
       undercover boss encounters is broke and mistreated might possibly
       point to there being widespread problems in the company as a whole,
       and expects us to be happy when the three or four individuals
       depicted get, like, a vacation, with no real changes made in the
       workplace.)

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [66]Civil
   Rights, [67]Community, [68]Congress, [69]Culture, [70]Economy,
   [71]Education, [72]Elections, [73]Energy, [74]Environment, [75]Health

   [81]National Security, [82]Science, [83]Transportation, or [84]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([85]California, [86]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       it would be completely arbitrary. Fixed costs + variable costs +
       profit margin are set into the price of the final product. Labor is
       a fixed cost bound by minimum wage (or rarely by prevailing
       regional wages if there are labor shortages).
       There is always a risk with increasing prices even by marginal
       amounts. Higher price may cause lowered demand. The price is set to
       maximize reward vs. risk.
       Increasing the (generally) fixed price of labor will increase the
       price, but that cost is spread over the number of items sold per
       hour. However, an individual will earn the additional amount per
       hour worked. It is not divided at all (excluding taxes). That
       increases buying power. So more people have more money, that
       negligible price increase is more than offset by the larger number
       of people with more money to spend.
       That calculation doesn't work forever, of course. We can't just set
       minimum wage at $100/hour and expect everything to be peachy. We
       can, however, expect small increases in wages over time to cause
       some inflation that is more than offset by the increased buying
       power of low wage workers.

 I feel a need to add a qualifier to this ([146]0+ / 0-)
       Labor intensive products and services are much more prone to
       inflationary pressures than mass produced products. The qualifier
       though has another corollary that labor intensive products often
       pay their laborers better than minimum wage and would not
       necessarily be affected to the extent that minimum wage laborers
       are. There would undoubtedly some wage increases as minimum wages
       define the floor of prevailing wages, but it is historically
       logarithmic in nature. The prevailing wage in a given region
       generally increases at a slower rate than the minimum wage.
       What will be of interest going forward is how that relationship
       between minimum wage and prevailing wages change if minimum wage is
       indexed to inflation. Does the prevailing wage follow the same
       formula, or do we come to an eventual point where minimum and
       prevailing wage meet? Or does prevailing wage excel inflation?
       There isn't much historical data to answer that, but my feeling is
       that prevailing wage increases would exceed inflation rates because
       of the perpetually increasing buying power of low wage workers.

 I'm totally overthinking now.. ([150]0+ / 0-)
       but what i mean by that last paragraph is that low wage workers
       make up a disproportionate  size of the economy in terms of
       spending and demand, so increasing their collective share of demand
       will also increase GDP (unspent or hoarded monies have no effect,
       or possibly a negative effect on actual GDP). Every bit of spending
       also increases tax revenues via sales taxes. Every dollar of income
       increases social security taxes via paycheck with holdings. The
       only potential drawback of increasing the minimum wage is
       inflationary pressures, and we debate this at a time when
       inflationary pressure is non-existent, and indeed when deflation is
       a real risk despite the huge amounts of money being printed by the
       fed at this time.
       It all lends to the idea that the real issue has nothing to with
       the money supply as it currently is, but where that money is
       currently being held and who is holding it. Increasing the minimum
       wage is the least that can be done to move some of that hoarded
       wealth into the hands of people who will actually use it in a
       productive capacity.

   What they are thinking about is how to give them less.

   It's always that.

   Automate and enable more labor per person and reduce the number of
   persons.

   Always.

   And the thing that makes it all work is the fear of getting less for
   our own labor in a classic divide and conquer scenario.

   Nobody wants to talk about the fact that we do not value our peers well
   enough to live a modest life, because when we do that, we either find
   we need to change how enterprises actually work and what their motives
   are

   , or

   we we find that we believe it's OK to screw a lot of us over so a few
   of us can get the max possible.

   Neither is a pretty scenario overall.

   There is another wrinkle here and that is risk.  When we allow labor to
   be compensated at a level below what that labor really costs, risk goes
   down too!

   Say we have somebody making sandwiches for $6 / hour, and it's full
   time.  That's not enough to pay for the person to actually live to make
   the sandwiches!

   That person must get help, or live without basic needs being met, both
   of which are expensive and brutal.

   Our lives are divided into thirds.  One to sleep, one to be who we are,
   raise a family, etc...  and one to labor.

   When we fail to value people properly, we force them to consume all
   their waking ours just trying to live, essentially forcing them to work
   to live and live to work with little else being possible.

   This kind of labor is a sure thing!  It takes the risk out of business,
   and where there is a sure thing, there is always a crowd looking for
   their share.

   Result?  Tons of "sure thing" kinds of jobs out there, because those
   employers are enjoying a subsidy business, not really having to account
   for many costs, externalized through the low labor.

 Raising Wages raises the economy. ([162]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [163]PSzymeczek

   The prices are arbitrary. The price on meals are set by what they think
   the public will pay. The meal on the other hand is sized down, cheaply
   made, and wages are cut back to make it match the set price. Increasing
   the wage by a set amount across the whole state or nation would raise
   the bar overall so competition wouldn't matter at all. Everyone would
   be equally affected. And more money in the pockets of the public would
   increase demand for the products as well.

   Let's say a minimum wage worker at McD's gets his pay bumped as well as
   the guy working at Staples, Pay Less Shoes, and Shaws. Now each of
   those employees can buy more products from the other employee's stores
   thus increasing demand. Get the picture?

   raise their meal costs by about the same amount if minimum wage was
   increased so McD's wouldn't be at a competitive disadvantage by doing
   so.

   If, however, McD's raised prices by four cents a meal now and the other
   fast food joints didn't, McD's would see some decrease in business
   (less customers and/or smaller orders).

   to know about the success of Santa Fe, NM (where we live part of the
   year) has a Living Wage ordinance.

     [221]What is the Living Wage?
     The term Living Wage refers to the minimum hourly wage necessary for
     a person to achieve a higher standard of living.

     Santa Fe's Living Wage
     The City of Santa Fe Living Wage Ordinance was adopted to establish
     minimum hourly wages.

     Effective March 1, 2013 all employers are required to pay employees
     an hourly wage of $10.51 per hour. This includes part-time and
     temporary employees.

     The March 1, 2013 Living Wage increase is in accordance with City
     Ordinance and corresponds to the increase in the Consumer Price
     Index (CPI) for the Western Region for Urban Wage Earners and
     Clerical Workers. All employers required to have a business license
     or registration from the City must pay at least the adjusted 2013
     Living Wage to employees for all hours worked within the Santa Fe
     city limits.

   Good on Senator Warren for being able to discuss facts and figures with
   that guy.

   We have, I believe, the highest minimum wage in the nation, at

   Also, when I drive to Costco (which pays better than minimum wage, and
   whose Seattle-area-based CEO actually supports an increase in the
   minimum wage) a few times a year, I go through downtown Wenatchee, WA
   and the past the former Cascadian Hotel. Hotel maid Elsie Parrish sued
   the West Coast Hotel Co for back pay when they failed to pay her
   Washington State's minimum wage. The case went all the way to the
   Supreme Court, and Elsie won.

   In [308]West Coast Hotel Co v. Parrish, the Supreme Court overturned an
   earlier ruling on the contitutionality of minimum wage laws, making
   them possible at the state and Federal levels.

       supports increasing minimum wage. It would hurt his competitors.
       Even if he had to bump the wages he pays to his employees to stay
       ahead of min-wage increases (presumably to attract and retain
       better workers), he still would be ahead since the costco model

 Walmart... ([328]0+ / 0-)
       ...is in a completely different business than Costco.
       Costco can be thought of as being in the business of selling
       memberships! They pull in over $2B a year in membership fees while
       their net profits are about $1.7B a year - the rest of the business
       is just to keep people buying memberships (yes, this is an
       oversimplification because selling/administering membership does
       have some costs so the fees are not pure profit)! Walmart has no
       membership income.
       Walmart supercenters, on the average, stock 142,000 different items
       - some of which probably only sell a few a month. Costco, on the
       other hand, stocks about 3,300 to 3,800 items per warehouse store
       and most of them have very high turnover.
       At Walmart, most individual items are handled at least twice by a
       store employee (once to put it on the shelf from the case, once at
       checkout). As well, due to the selection of products, some of which
       sell infrequently, a significant percentage of items require
       "additional" touches by a store employee to "clean up" the shelves
       on a regular basis. At Costco, many individual items are touched
       only once by a store employee (at checkout) as cases are put on the
       "shelves" and customers "uncrate" them into their carts.
       As well, the average selling price per item is much higher (due to
       package sizes and, on the average, higher end merchandise) at
       Costco than Walmart so even if the same number of "employee
       touches" were required, the revenue per touch would be much higher
       than at Costco.
       Obviously, labor costs are much more important to Walmart's bottom
       line and product pricing than Costco.

       They sold off Sam's Club?
       I don't hear the WalMart CEO or the Sam's Club management
       advocating for an increased minimum wage, despite Sam's Club having
       the identical business model. I've never heard that Sam's Club
       employees are well-treated; I have heard that about Costco
       employees.
       And Costco has 174,000 employees - a $1 increase in the minimum
       wage, even if most of those employees don't work a 40 hr week on
       average, is still a serious chunk of cash. Yet they're in favor of
       an increase.
       I still don't see why I shouldn't support companies with business
       models that include treating employees well. And I haven't been in
       a WalMart or Sam's in over 20 years.

 Sams Club ([337]0+ / 0-)
       Sorry, yes the Sam's Club segment does have some membership income
       but it's not very significant relative to their net income or
       profits of Walmart (the corporation, not the segment). I was
       thinking of the Walmart "segment" of Walmart "the corporation", not
       the Walmart corporation as a whole.
       Sam's had about $1.1B income from memberships but this represented
       only about 5.4% of Walmart's overall operating income. As such,
       it's relatively insignificant to the company as a whole. However,
       it is a substantial chunk of Sam's Club's operating income (which
       is about $1.9B), not too dissimilar to Costco
       Sam's Club is a fairly small part of Walmart overall. Sam's Club
       accounts for only about 12% of the net sales (including domestic
       and international) and something around 7% of operating income.
       Walmart has about 2.2 million employees worldwide -- over ten times
       that of Costco.
       Costco has a revenue of about $99M or about 99/0.174 =
       $569K/employee. Walmart (including Sam's Club) has a revenue of
       about $469M or about 469/2.2 = $213K/employee. If we assume that
       average hours per employee per week at both companies is the
       same^1, an constant increase in wages while keeping profits
       constant would require that Walmart raise prices 569/213 = 2.6
       times more than Costco. This, of course, helps Costco and hurts
       Walmart. In fact, since Costco already pays higher wages, they
       would probably not have to raise their wages quite as much.
       It's in Costco's economic interest to support legislation that
       hurts their competition more than it hurts them (i.e. "rent
       seeking"). I suspect that Costco's support for a wage increase may
       not be quite as pure as it seems at first glance.
                                     ______

       [1] Admittedly a big assumption that I'm pulling out of the air -
       I'd guess that Walmart employees work less hours per week in
       reality.

 Why argue motives? ([341]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [342]417els

       I don't care why some companies treat their employees well (within
       the law and certain moral constraints, of course), only that they
       do so.
       Would the extra income for workers be less spendable because
       Costco's motives don't seem pure to you? It doesn't seem Costco is
       doing any harm to anyone by advocating the minimum wage. They have
       no responsibility to make WalMart's shoddy, low employee
       productivity business model succeed.
       And the business press and case study links I can find via google
       generally say that Jim Sinegal believes employee satisfaction leads
       to profitability. Costco seems to structure their company on that
       principle - far beyond just supporting increases in the minimum
       wage. Do you have some evidence he's being deceitful when he says
       that? Because when I shop at Costco, the employees generally seem
       both happy and helpful.
       Is it possible that the Costco model aligns employee interests with
       corporate interests, and isn't that better - a win-win situation -
       for all of us?
       I've never bought into the point of view that all corporate types
       are greedy and venal. Just most of them. I worked for a company (no
       longer exists) that had a similar attitude to what Costco's appears
       to be. I knew the CEO/founder, and he treated employees well
       because he was a decent guy. He built a $4B/yr company doing that,
       and there's a major business school named after him.

 You are making this an argument, ... ([346]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [347]Samulayo

       ...not I.
       My point was simple, to compare Walmart (the segment consisting of
       'non warehouse' Walmart stores - those that most people think of as
       'Walmart' instead of as 'Sam's Club') to Costco is like comparing
       airplanes to railroads -- both sell stuff, but the business model
       and economics of the two are as unlike as strip mining and
       nano-technology in spite of both of them moving stuff. I just can't
       think of a time that I've made a decision to "shop at Walmart or
       Costco for these items" -- the answer is obvious: If Costco has it
       in their limited inventory and I need a lot of it, I buy it at
       Costco, else I'll buy it somewhere else.
       Personally, and of course I've only shopped at Costco for twenty
       plus years and only at maybe eight warehouses routinely, I've not
       found the employees to be particularly helpful or particularly
       happy. Generally they seem quite a bit smarter than the minimum
       wage worker at Walmart. I doubt that Costco would hire most Walmart
       workers at any price -- i.e., if all stores were Costco, likely
       wages would be higher and 80% of those that worked at Walmart would
       be unemployed. I've seen horribly irresponsible behavior by Costco
       workers just because they couldn't be bothered or had the
       time/motivation to do the right thing - they are not Gods.
       If I had to work retail, personally, I would likely pick Walmart
       over Costco based on what little I know -- simply because I could
       become a store manager and regional manager much more quickly at
       Walmart as the competition for such jobs would be much easier and
       the rewards greater for the higher levels once one achieves them.
       Interesting that the company whose CEO you thought had a similar
       attitude to Costco's "no longer exists". Without more information,
       it sounds like that model didn't work so well -- perhaps there's
       more to it than that.
       If you think that Costco isn't ruthless, I think you may be buying
       into an image, not a reality. Do you think that Costco borrowing
       billions of dollars just to pay out big dividends to shareholders
       before the end of 2012 in anticipation of higher tax rates in 2013
       on was "pure"? It's good business (all publicly traded corporations
       answer, within the law and contracts they enter into, only to their
       shareholders - not their customers or their employees), but it's
       not particularly "community minded". For reasons like this, I don't
       just assume that Costco's motives are "pure" without evidence
       supporting that.
       Yes, Costco benefits from having smarter employees and paying them
       a bit more while requiring them to be very flexible and not
       constrained by contract imposed constraints (such as those that
       would prevent a checker from being assigned to unload a truck).
       But, labor is just a smaller part of their equation than it is for
       "classic" Walmart stores so the cost is not as important.
       For some random differences: Costco has NO 24 hour stores. Costco
       has a higher income consumer. Costco has larger packages which are
       harder to steal. Costco isn't trying to be a full service retailer
       by any stretch of the imagination. Costco has more control over
       their customers because their customers, by agreeing to terms of
       membership, have contractually agreed to some things (like checking
       contents of carts at the door which a regular retail outlet, at
       least in the state I live in, can only "ask" to do).
       Yes, I hate shopping at Walmart the few time's I've done it. I wish
       they would hire trainable employees and train them better, but
       that's not their model. It may be biting their ass now with
       stocking problems in some stores and I am humored by that.

 I started out simply saying that ([351]0+ / 0-)
       Costco's CEO advocated raising the minimum wage.  You and another
       poster seemed to think that was some kind of naivety on my part.
       And then you complain I'm argumentative when I point out I don't
       really care why they do it, but just that they do.
       That's been largely my point. You could have left it alone a few
       posts ago, but you insisted on trying to prove to me that they're
       really ravening wolves - I'm suggesting by their fruits ye shall
       know them.
       Once again, I don't care if Costco is ruthless, if they meet what I
       consider are their responsibilities to their employees, customers
       and community (they have a good environmental record too, from the
       little I've read, in addition to providing good paying jobs). They
       have no responsibility to not be ruthless with respect to their
       competitors, and in fact vis a vis someone like the Walton family,
       that would be one more plus IMO. I don't plan to marry Jim Sinegal
       (even though it would be legal in WA) - I just shop at his store.
       They sell Koch Brothers paper products, which I don't buy (Fred
       Meyer/Kroger is cheaper anyway), and they're responsible for
       substantially increasing the cost of hard liquor here (which I also
       don't buy from them). I can get eggs for nearly 30 cents a dozen
       less from my local grocer, who also treats his employees well, or
       orange juice cheaper from Safeway, which is UFCW. But on balance, I
       feel good shopping there both because I save a substantial amount
       on food, and because I'm more in agreement with the company and its
       practices than in disagreement.
       It's not like their CEO is as big an asshole as the CEO of Whole
       Foods, even if he's a ruthless competitor.
       As to my former employer, it was a successful enough business model
       that I made out nicely on company stock when the company was
       acquired by a competitor. By then the founder wasn't much involved
       in the business beyond being a major stockholder (it was a long
       while after I left - too much travel with a kid at home; my wife,
       who worked there too, and I have run a similar business from home
       for 26 years - on a slightly smaller scale), and it was the then
       current management who negotiated the sale.  People I knew who were
       still there made out pretty well in employment terms too - there
       weren't any mass layoffs due to consolidation.

 Democrats failing on Min Wage ([366]5+ / 0-)

   Democrats running NYC, LA, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and other
   high cost of living cities are not doing their job in regards to a
   minimum wage.

   Reasonable minimum wage laws will not exist until the minimum wage
   reflect the local cost of living.

   The cost of living in the US varies so widely, that no single minimum
   wage can make economic sense across the country.

   The Democrats not supporting the $9 and $10/hr proposals are from
   places that have low costs of living - as they think the increase would
   make the minimum too high for the area they represent.

   A person making  the current minimum wage of $7.25/hr in Tulsa, OK
   would need to make $17.62 in New York City to have the same purchasing
   power.  Meanwhile, the current minimum wage in NYC is only $7.25/hr -
   the Federal minimum wage.

   So NYC has a minimum wage equivalent to a min wage of $3/hr in Tulsa
   and Pres Obama's proposal for $9 is equivalent to $3.70/hr min wage in
   Tulsa.  For all practical purposes, NYC does not have a minimum wage.
   The cost of living between these two cities are so large that a single
   minimum wage for these two cities cannot make sense.

   Minimum wage laws need to be  set at different rates to reflect the
   local cost of living.  The major failure of minimum wage laws are in
   the high cost of living cities - which ironically are run mainly by
   Democrats at the local and State level (NYC, LA, San Francisco,
   Chicago, Washington DC, Boston, etc.) and none have local min wages
   that come anywhere near a cost of living adjusted $7.25/hr which would
   be $14 to $18/hr.

   Having the minimum wage vary by location, based on BLS cost of living
   data for low income households would allow members of the House and
   Senate from low cost of living locations to support the move, while
   also having a meaningful minimum wage in high cost of living locations.

   The most important way to protect the environment is not to have more
   than one child.

       This is how it is done for federal employees on the GS scale, who
       get "locality pay" based on the cost of living in that metro.

 regional ([379]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [380]nextstep, [381]JerryNA

   What I would like to see is a regional minimum wage .  For instance a
   fari wage for unskilled work in texas is somewhere between $11-14 an
   hour.  That should be minimum wage.  However, other states have a much
   higher cost of living.  A fair wage in Washington state, for instance,
   might be closer to $15-20 an hour.  I think that this compromise would
   significantly reduce the debate in the minimum wage because places
   where it does not cost so much to live will not have to overpay when
   they can't really sell their product at higher prices.

   For instance, lets say that we were able to make the minimum wage a
   base of $10 an hour, then encourage every state and local through
   federal pressure to adjust for cost of living.  Bad conservative places
   like Texas won't oppose too much because they will be able to argue
   that cost of living adjustment will only require about $9 an hour,
   while Seattle will have the backing to mandate a progressive $15 an
   hour.

   Because when we count apples, the minimum wage is not about the cost
   increase that it might incur at unskilled jobs, it is the cost to
   acquire skilled labor.  Right now, one can acquire a college graduate
   to do semi-skilled work for about twice of minimum wage.  If minimum
   wage were to increase from $7 to $10, then one might expect to have to
   pay $20 for a college graduate, which would be a significant increase.

   But like guns now, I think the left really got hoodwinked on wages over
   the past 15 years of so. With all the free money and low wages for the
   middle class, and all the military jobs anyone, even the unfit, could
   fill, no one notice that there were no real paid jobs.

   without the rush of businesses the GOP said were just dying to come

   counties and other entities from passing laws that would gaurantee paid
   sick leave to their employees.

   ALEC, the Kochs, the TeaParty, the RW Mackinac Center and the DeVos

 Trading Places moment needed. ([390]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [391]PSzymeczek

   While the Representative from Minnesota is trying to see what it is
   like trying to survive on the minimum wage, what we really need to do
   is pull a "Trading Places" moment on these bureaucrats in office.

   Call it Survivor in the "real world" if it makes it clearer to you.

   - Take the Representative into a room...
   - Have him remove all his clothes and belongings on the table.
   - Hand him some worn out clothes that haven't been washed in months to
   wear.
   - Blindfold him and drop him off in the backwoods of Mississippi or
   some other depressed area without any identification.

   Don't tell him when you might be back for him. Just drop him off and
   leave him to rot on his own for a good looooonnnggg time. No cameras.
   No press. Just himself. No money or credit. Not even his name to rely
   on. Then let's see how he feels in a few months. Hmmm?
