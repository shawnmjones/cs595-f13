   night owl
   [29]NewsWorks, via [30]Atrios:

     Weight limits on aging bridges across Pennsylvania may be in place
     by the fall.

     The move would be a direct result of the failure to pass a $2
     billion transportation-funding plan in the state Legislature.

     PennDOT has 1,200 bridges in its sights that would be
     weight-restricted -- meaning certain vehicles would have to find
     detours.

   At issue is an apparent Republican inability to [31]muster the votes
   for the spending bill in the GOP-led House. The House will take up the
   bill again [32]in the fall, though likely not in time to avert the new
   restrictions.

   Someday we're going to get a full accounting of just how much recent
   "austerity" eventually cost us in terms of overall GDP, and it's not
   going to be pretty. Then we're going to do the same thing again next
   time because it's not about getting the trucks where the trucks need to
   go or getting the jobs to the people that need the jobs, it's about the
   ideological necessity of self-inflicted harm. The harm itself is
   considered the more noble path.

   Well, that or they're just incompetent.
            _____________________________________________________

   [33]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2009--Palin
   secedes from office. Also.:

   So Sarah Palin has resigned. From four colleges. From her job with the
      Oil & Gas Commission. And now finally, from her job as governor.

    Highly unusual for someone once so determined to climb the political
        ladder that she stayed on in Texas to deliver a speech to the
   Republican Governors' Association, even as she went into labor with her
                 fifth child. But, hey, that's Sarah. Also.

   Now, my first thought was that she merely meant that she was tired and
     wanted to recline, but alas, she left little doubt about her actual
    intentions with her extended, often rambling speech, during which the
                     local waterfowl laughed repeatedly.

   Palin's first draft, by the way, reportedly began: "When in the course
                        of human... stuff... (also)."

    It's truly been an amazing few weeks for the America, as we found out
    that GOP governors celebrate Father's Day with adultery, and July 4th
                          by resigning from office.

   featuring Greg Dworkin rounding up jobs report & presidential polling

   And hey, municipal bond rackets, too.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [54]Tagging tips - [55]Search For Tags - [56]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       these new users are spammers or bots.  While the rate had been
       getting faster, it seems they suddenly started slowing down right
       when Hurricane Sandy hit.  It slowed down to under 1,000 new users
       in a 24-hour period, and we were back down to somewhat over 100 new
       users every 24 hours or so, until about January 30th, when it

       I think it's more about stirring the pot to get some attention.
       For one thing, I would think they would be aware that Jan Brewer,
       of all people, signed a law in 2011 that made protests within XX
       number of feet of a memorial service a misdemeanor.
       For thing B, between DFHs, various biker groups and rightwingnut
       gun freaks, they wouldn't even dare to drive thru town.
       I bet ya, dollars to donuts, some wannabe border guards are
       maintaining sentries on the main access into town.
       Nonetheless, your alert is necessary, just in case somebody around
       there hasn't heard about WBC's stated intentions.

       place to ask for it. I'm a new user and I posted my first diary
       today. I wanted to add links in the same manner as your comment
       above. I put the URL in the box and the word I wanted to link it
       to, but the linking word kept showing up as the first word of the
       diary instead of in the middle of the sentence where it belonged.

 Scalia's son to headline Anti-Gay "Conference." ([305]14+ / 0-)

   While Dad is [320]palling around with Dick Cheney between writing
   vicious, intemperate screeds disguised as legal opinions, here's what
   our esteemed Justice's [321]son is doing:

     It seems homophobia, like homosexuality, runs in the family.
     Courage, a Roman Catholic organization dedicated to promoting
     abstinence for people with "same-sex attractions," just announced
     its 2013 Courage Conference headliners. Saturday's star speaker?
     Rev. Paul Scalia, son of Antonin, founder of Arlington's Courage
     chapter and chair of Courage's board of directors. Scalia is
     scheduled to give a speech entitled "Fearing the Lord ... and Not
     Being Afraid." It will probably run along the lines of Scalia's
     previous pronouncements on the matter:

         [H]omosexual acts are intrinsically disordered. The word
     disordered means that such acts fail to observe the design and
     purpose of human sexuality. They lack the natural ordering to
     procreation. They also lack the complementarity necessary to achieve
     the union of two persons in one flesh. The word intrinsically means
     that the disorder is in the nature of the acts themselves. They are
     always and at all times immoral. No situation, circumstance or
     affection can make them moral...[H]omosexual inclination is [also]
     objectively disordered

   Some more words of wisdom from the [322]Scalia Offspring, who contends
   there is no such thing as a "homosexual person":

     "Homosexual tendencies (to use a term from magisterial documents),
     do not constitute a fixed, unchangeable aspect of the person and
     therefore should not be considered an 'orientation.' Further, the
     term does violence to a proper understanding of human sexuality.
     Either our sexuality is oriented in a certain direction (i.e. toward
     the one-flesh union of marriage), or it is not. We cannot speak of
     more than one sexual 'orientation' any more than we can think of the
     sun rising in more than one place (i.e. the orient)."

     We cannot speak of more than one sexual 'orientation' any more than
     we can think of the sun rising in more than one place (i.e. the
     orient).

   The sun doesn't rise.  It stays in one place while the earth turns.
   There was a time when that simple statement of fact was enough to deem
   someone disordered (or even criminal).

   concern. It is the key to overcoming their own mortality.

   Some are clueless about even that. David Koch, for example, didn't
   realize he'd overlooked that until he was fifty. So, he quickly got
   hitched and his wife produced a son.

   Cons are self-centered. "Procreation" is reproduction from a
   self-centered perspective which ignores process. To procreate is to
   imitate the Creator--to take a piece of clay and breathe life into it.
   It's magic. Calling it metaphor doesn't change that it's magic --
   things appearing to happen without agency. Action (process) is what is
   missing from the Cons' repertoir.

       Incompetence requires (A) inability to do [x] correctly and (B)
       insulation from consequences and negative feedback.
       Politicians in general live in a system that really promotes this
       but republicans seem to make an art of it.
       Repubs do meet the criteria, but they seem to go an additional step
       and actively deny negative feedback when it becomes overwhelming.
       Then instead of addressing the issues and resolving them, even more
       harsh and underhanded measures are taken.
       So they can be more than incompetent, they are malicious.

     PennDOT has 1,200 bridges in its sights that would be

   Leading to more gas tax revenue, leading to more money to repair the

   More like a collection of impulses

     ..it's about the ideological necessity of self-inflicted harm. The
     harm itself is considered the more noble path.

   After 30 billion for "border security" - blackhawk helicopters and such
   and a history of rampant spending aimed at the 1%ers in tax
   expenditures or choosing to serve up tax cuts to global corporations
   (some of which pay zero taxes in the US) instead of supporting workers
   her at home.

   So "conservative" is definitely out

   Naw, the republicans reactionary collection of impulses doesn't rise to
   the level of an "ideology". Not even close.

   I say we find a new term for the GOP that describes their behavior more
   accurately.

    A system that is made up of: avarice, stupidity, fear, racism, passive
   aggresion, lying, isolationism, greed, cruelty, subservience, more
   lying, arrogance, unskilled parasitic dependence, cowardice, hatred,
   their need to control others while entralled by a hierarchy that
   absolves them of responsibility (religion & governance - though with
   republicans it's one in the same) while gripped by dreams of
   independence and the list goes on worsening

 I-5 Skagit River bridge reopens less than a month ([866]4+ / 0-)

   after collapse

     The state Transportation Department said Tuesday traffic will have
     to slow to 40 miles an hour (64 km/h) on the narrow temporary span,
     and oversized or overweight loads will continue to be detoured until
     a permanent fix in the fall.

     The temporary span and a permanent replacement due this fall will
     cost nearly $18 million. The U.S. federal government is paying for
     all but about $1 million of the work.

     Because the 58-year-old bridge is being restored, not replaced, it
     will still be rated as "functionally obsolete" because it was not
     designed to handle today's traffic volume and big trucks.

     It's also "fracture critical," meaning that if a single, vital
     component is compromised, the bridge can crumple again.

 Just a random thought on spending... ([879]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [880]Eric Nelson, [881]Ender, [882]JeffW

   anyone else cringe at the $38 billion price tag for "securing the
   border" in the immigration bill?

   I didn't. I screamed to wake the dead.

   This is hardly a newsflash but the hypocrisy of the Republicans
   insisting on this dubious, government-expanding, earmark-laden
   component of the bill astounds.

   What would they say if we said we'd better off spending that money on
   infrastructure? "Boondoggle." "Pork." "Blaspheme."

   From [883]WaPo:

     The legislation would require the U.S. Border Patrol to acquire,
     among other items, six Northrop Grumman airborne radar systems that
     cost $9.3 million each, 15 Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopters that
     average more than $17 million apiece, and eight light enforcement
     helicopters made by American Eurocopter that sell for about $3
     million each. The legislation also calls for 17 UH-1N helicopters
     made by Bell Helicopter, an older model that the company no longer
     manufactures.

   This bill would double the amount of border agents, a number that's
   already doubled since 2004, and does so in spite of the fact no new
   agents were requested in the current budget. How's that for cutting the
   size of government.

   We can only dream that some of this funding could find it's way to
   backhoes and bulldozers instead of out-of-production helicopters. And
   welders and cement finishers instead of unneeded border guards.

   Oh well. Good luck crossing those defective bridges my fellow
   Americans. Happy Independence Day.

       The question is why the U.S. electronics industry is so dependent

   The social dems zig-zag election campaign where Steibrueck visited
   coincidentally (any voter) to eat cake there, or criticized Grille
   Beppo, or criticized the low pay for Merkel as chancellor got a new
   more or less bad puzzle part: investment into industrial development.
   Of course you can ask what does have it in common with the crap he said
   before? Then again, you can ask what you want to do with the rest at
   all. I mean its surely not forbidden to criticize Vietcong generals,
   though you shouldnt connect them to Mr Roesler, Saigon Vietnamese and

 It's only self-inflicted harm if you identify with ([910]0+ / 0-)

   the legislators. Scofflaw legislators are deprivators. Their aim is to
   punish, not serve the populace. So, they refuse to fund what they don't
   use themselves.
   The people presuming to engage in self-government have to be put in
   their place, and quick. Otherwise, the scofflaws will be pink slipped.
   You might think the risk of being sacked would improve performance.
   But, that's not how bullies react. Pink slips are like red flags in the

   It always amazes me how progressives are great at sitting around
   arguing the esoteric aspects of an issue and totally inept at drumming
   in the basic facts to low information voters.

   The weight restrictions in PA and the foolish delaying of
   infrastructure work while interest rates are low costs money! "If your
   products cost more today and your tolls are higher tomorrow, blame the
   Republicans who are blocking common sense."

   In the barrage of ads up to the PA governor's race a single sentence
   like this won't sink in. But if you start now, you have the field to
   yourself.

   It's loaded with pork, or more accurately crap.  Fix the bridges and
   stop fucking with the roads unnecessarily just to enrich contractors.
   And I don't want the legislature to get into the habit of passing
   anything besides a budget, because its legislative impulses are all
   bad: pensions, privatization (although I am sympathetic to getting the
   state out of the liquor business, Corbett of course wants to do it as
   exploitatively as possible), and God (the majority whip, of course)
   knows what else.
