       woman. o  The pro-amendment campaign pushed back against opponents'
       claims that the amendment would weaken domestic violence
       protections for unmarried women.

   State to become 31st to constitutionally forbid same-sex marriage

   By Lynn Bonner and Jay Price --
   [156]lbonner@newsobserver.comjprice@newsobserver.com

   RALEIGH -- North Carolina has become the 31st state to add an amendment
   on marriage to its constitution, with voters banning same-sex marriage
   and barring legal recognition of unmarried couples by state and local
   governments.

   North Carolina is the last state in the South to add such an amendment,
   and supporters hoped for a resounding victory.

   Incomplete returns show the amendment up 61.05 percent to 38.95
   percent.

   Primary turnout was heavy. Though there were many other races on the
   ballot, including primaries for statewide offices and congressional
   seats, the amendment appeared to drive much of the political
   discussion.

   Marriage rights for gay couples has been a topic of national debate
   this year, and North Carolina's amendment and the campaigns for and
   against it drew international attention.

   North Carolinians think of the state as progressive, but that's within
   the context of the rest of the South, said Andrew Taylor, a political
   scientist at N.C. State University.

   "This is a socially conservative state," he said.

   The state has a 16-year-old law banning same-sex marriage.

   At least two other states will be voting on gay marriage rights in
   November. Minnesota has a constitutional amendment on its ballot. Maine
   has a referendum to allow same-sex marriage. Voters in Maryland and
   Washington state may be asked to affirm new state laws allowing
   same-sex marriage.

   Money from national interest groups poured into North Carolina. The
   National Organization for Marriage contributed $425,000 to the Vote for
   Marriage campaign, according to the latest reports, and the Human
   Rights Campaign and its affiliates contributed nearly $500,000 to the
   opposition Coalition to Protect All N.C. Families.

   Vote for Marriage raised more than $1 million, and the Coalition to
   Protect All N.C. Families raised more than $2 million.

   U.S. amendment called for

   The Rev. Billy Graham appeared in a full-page ad supporting the
   amendment, and others in his family recorded pro-amendment messages.

   About 250 amendment supporters crowded a ballroom at the Hilton North
   Raleigh for the celebration that was part standard-issue campaign
   victory party and part wedding reception.

   There was a cash bar, and music that included love songs. The
   centerpiece was a seven-tier white wedding cake, capped by a plastic
   heterosexual couple embracing.

   After the Associated Press declared that the amendment would pass, Tami
   Fitzgerald, the Vote for Marriage chairwoman, took the stage to thank
   the churches, political groups and other volunteers who had helped
   deliver the win.

   "Ladies and gentlemen, through God's great mercy we have won an
   overwhelming victory tonight," she said.

   The voters, she said, sent a clear and unmistakable desire to "protect
   marriage in our state, in our country.

   "As you all know, marriage was not invented by government. Our creator
   established it as the union of a man and a woman in an exclusive
   lifelong covenant and it has merely been recognized by government as
   the key to a strong and flourishing society."

   Amendment opponents had former President Bill Clinton and his former
   chief of staff Erskine Bowles record telephone messages to voters.
   President Barack Obama's campaign put out a statement saying he opposed
   the amendment.

   Opponents worked to raise doubts about the amendment's consequences,
   including running television ads that focused on weakened domestic
   violence protections for unmarried couples, and loss of health
   insurance for children of same-sex couples.

   The early returns projected at the front of the downtown Raleigh event
   hall were mostly ignored by the crowd of amendment opponents who joined
   the gathering.

   Jen Jones, communications director for Protect All NC Families, said
   the campaign would have done nothing differently.

   "We had an unprecedented coalition," she said. "We were on TV as much
   as we wanted to be. We talked to everyone we could about unintended
   consequences."

   Incomplete returns show the amendment losing in only a handful of
   counties, including Wake, Durham, Orange, Chatham, Buncombe and
   Watauga. The amendment was losing in Mecklenburg County, but results
   there were incomplete.

   Opponents anticipate a slew of lawsuits with the courts ultimately
   deciding how the amendment will effect employment-related benefits and
   legal arrangements between unmarried couples.

   Church involvement credited

   The Vote for Marriage campaign has its foundation in churches and ran
   television ads featuring the Bible. They fought back against what they
   characterized as opponents' myths, saying that the amendment would have
   no impact on domestic violence protections.

   "The involvement of the local churches across this state was absolutely
   the turning point," said the Rev. Mark Harris, president of the Baptist
   State Convention of North Carolina.

   The string of national amendment victories supports arguments for
   amending the U.S. Constitution to allow only heterosexual marriages,
   Harris said.

   Before the campaigns ramped to full intensity, Harris called for a
   "civil conversation" on the issue.

   Civility seemed to melt away by Tuesday.

   A Cabarrus County man posted a YouTube video of himself firing a
   shotgun into a "vote against" sign. A Durham neighborhood listserv
   stopped taking comments on the amendment when the debate got too hot.

   Campaigners for and against the amendment called a steady stream of
   complaints into the Wake County Board of Elections on Tuesday, each
   side complaining about the opponents' illegal electioneering.

   "I've never seen anything like this," said Gary D. Sims, Wake's deputy
   elections director.

   A strong election draw

   For some voters, the amendment was the main or only reason they came to
   the polls.

   Cameron Hughes, 25, was in the process of moving to Charlotte for a new
   job in banking, but came all the way back to Chapel Hill Tuesday
   afternoon and drove straight to his polling place on Estes Drive.

   Fueling his trip in equal measure were gasoline and cold anger that the
   amendment was even on the ballot.

   "It's an embarrassment and it's pathetic, and I'm ashamed to have to
   come out here and vote on something like this, and, if the polls are
   right, I'm ashamed that apparently a large majority of the citizens of
   my state are pro-bigotry," he said.

   Hughes made the long trip to ink in just one oval on his ballot. He
   said that he had been so focused on finishing up work on a graduate
   degree in recent months that he hadn't been able to properly study the
   candidates for various offices.

   Lynne Greene, of Cary, voted for the amendment, at the Fellowship of
   Christ Presbyterian Church polling site. She said she could support
   civil unions but not gay marriage.

   "I have an issue with the use of the word marriage," said Greene, a
   Republican who is retired. "I believe a marriage is between a man and a
   woman."

   `People are conflicted'

   Polling by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling and the
   conservative Civitas Institute both showed the amendment winning by
   double digits, but the Public Policy Poll showed that a majority
   rejected the amendment after they learned it would also ban civil
   unions and domestic partnerships.

   "People are conflicted," said Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, executive director
   of the Campaign for Southern Equality, a group advocating for full
   marriage rights for gay couples. "They hear one thing in their faith
   community, particularly that homosexuality is a sin. They have an LGBT
   (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) family member or neighbor or
   co-worker. People are trying to reconcile those two experiences."

   Voters said they were confused about the amendment's wording, and that
   confusion continued in some polling places where some voters received
   ballots without the constitutional question on it that were intended
   for 17-year-old voters

   A Triangle voter advocacy group says it has received numerous
   complaints from people who were given the wrong ballot while trying to
   vote Tuesday.

   The N.C. Election Protection hot line, part of a nationwide voter
   education coalition coordinated by the Lawyers Committee for Civil
   Rights Under the Law, fielded calls from voters all day who were given
   a ballot without the amendment, said Elizabeth Haddix, staff attorney
   with the UNC-Chapel Hill Center for Civil Rights, which sponsored the
   hot line Tuesday.

   "We've certainly gotten a heavy volume of calls, many more than we
   expected in a primary," she said.
