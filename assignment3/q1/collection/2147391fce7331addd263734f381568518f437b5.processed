[22]Open thread for night owls: Why not a 'grand bargain' that makes life
better for the working class?

   digby [29]writes about the "grand bargain:

    [30]Alex Pareene at Salon has written a great piece about the revival
   of the Grand Bargain in his inimitable style that's well-worth reading.
   I just want to pull out on little piece that I don't think many people
                             really understand:

     Here's a fun secret: Tax reform (in this case referring to
     eliminating or scaling back "tax expenditures") is technically a
     conservative policy priority, even if elected Republicans refuse to
     ever support it for real. This is a compromise in which conservative
     policy is being offered in exchange for conservative support for a
     conservative policy. The sequester and Obama's Bargain quest mean
     that Republicans can choose between allowing a Democrat to "take
     credit" for cutting the two most popular programs in the country or
     they can just live with the already-passed government spending cut
     that they are also able to blame on the president.

    Also keep in mind that tax reform has been one of the pillars of the
     Grand Bargain since President Obama first proposed it in 2009. It's
    pretty much guaranteed to be, at best, some sort of symbolic loophole
    closing while at the same time "broadening the base and lowering the
            rates." It's a "reform" only a tax lawyer could love.

   Pareene also notes:

    There are two important things to remember about "entitlements": They
   are hugely popular programs for a very good reason, and actual sensible
    "reform" would mean improving them, not sacrificing them at the altar
    of "fiscal responsibility." A "grand bargain" that was done with the
   intention of creating the best possible outcome for the most Americans,
    instead of with the intention of purposefully doing unpopular things
    because doing unpopular things denotes "seriousness," would lower the
   Medicare eligibility age and expand Social Security. That the opposite
      approach is effectively the bipartisan consensus approach is the
     special sort of Beltway madness that makes sensible people wish for
   either a proper parliamentary system or at the very least for an EMP to
      take out Georgetown and much of Washington's surrounding suburbs.

   [31]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2005--Sen.
   Sarbanes Not Running in '06:

     Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a son of Greek immigrants who became the
    longest-serving United States senator in Maryland history, said today
      that he would not run for a sixth term next year. "It was not my
     ambition to stay there until they carried me out," Mr. Sarbanes, a
   Democrat, said in a news conference at his Baltimore office, according
    to The Associated Press. "It was just the right time. We think we've
     served long and well and honorably, and we're very comfortable with
    this decision."Mr. Sarbanes, 72, said his health was not a factor in
                                his decision.

     The senator has had a generally liberal voting record in his three
   decades in the chamber. He won his most recent re-election, in 2000, by
                        a margin of 63 to 37 percent.

   On today's [37]Kagro in the Morning show, the AP joins NBC (and Daily
   Kos) in cataloging the gun incidents of 1/19. But why no mention of Gun
   Appreciation Day? Greg Dworkin updated us on the "Team 26" ride & made
   the case for guns as a public health issue. In DC news: the Senate
   begins on a budget, R presidential hopefuls view CPAC as a springboard
   to legitimacy (!), Jeb denies the existence of Bush family baggage,
   Coburn says leadership is the big hurdle to compromise, House R Whip
   quietly declares the Hastert Rule dead, and R crazies make compromise
   tough. Shocking! Lastly, Krugman on Dwindling Deficit Disorder &
   OurFuture.org's exposure of the CEOs behind "Fix the Debt."

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [54]Tagging tips - [55]Search For Tags - [56]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Excerpt from today's mini-blogathon:

     This is how we roll. We're a team! [369]#Newtown2DC

   Tweet Pic from Monte Frank - Tweet Pic from Monte Frank - "This is how
   we roll" - Three Team 26 riders supporting each other up a long hill.
   Experienced cyclists at Daily Kos Explain the Joy and Power of Riding
   in a Peloton
   To my inexperienced eyes, cyclists riding in a [372]peloton always look
   so strong.

   What I love most about the picture, "This is How we Roll," that Monte
   Frank tweeted yesterday is the way it shows the vulnerability of
   competing with your team. When you rely on your team to help you until
   you catch your second wind, it's the antithesis of "You're on your
   own!" In the comments yesterday, experienced cyclists here at Daily Kos
   interpreted the picture, explaining both the power and the joy of
   riding in a peloton.

   Dear occupant explained why the picture of cyclists supporting their
   teammate is his favorite.

     by dear occupant on [373]Sun Mar 10, 2013 at 11:47:00 AM PDT

     This ride is inspiring.

     I was a competitive cyclist for 20 years or so and heartened by the
     first pic showing the 3 riders. That 'hands on' gesture is an old
     skool cycling tradition.

     The rider on the right is struggling a bit, you can see the pack
     further ahead at the top of the pic. The second rider is pushing and
     aiding the first, the third rider is pushing the second. They are a
     team, they are in this together and that pic couldn't show that
     devotion any better.

     B R A V O riders!

     by dear occupant on [374]Sun Mar 10, 2013 at 12:16:07 PM PDT

     Peloton riding is a joy and it's also a highly developed skill to
     properly place yourself to take the wind for the rider behind you,
     to stay steady to not bump a wheel, to know when to drop back or
     move to the front sensing when that rider is spent.  There is a
     power in the peloton.

     When it's done well, there are few feelings better in team sports.

   Sfbob pointed out that riding in a peloton uses the same strategy that
   migrating birds use to conserve energy.

     by sfbob on [375]Sun Mar 10, 2013 at 01:00:43 PM PDT

     I'm an endurance cyclist rather than a competitive cyclist but I did
     compete once. At the beginning of my training for that event it was
     explained to me that pelotons work on the same principle as
     migrating flocks of birds. Each bird takes turns blocking the wind
     so that the ones behind it can save their energy; as the lead bird
     tires it moves to the back to recharge.

   BeninSC explained the physics behind the joy of cycling in a peloton.

     by BeninSC on [376]Sun Mar 10, 2013 at 02:14:54 PM PDT

     It is one of the few ways members of our species can personally and
     directly experience the miracles of fluid dynamics. Riding in a
     peleton is a special experience, indeed. I have never met any of
     these guys, but I know them as my brothers, all the same.

     Fukushima And The Navy: Sailors Sue Japan Nuclear Plant Owner,
     Saying Disaster Made Them Sick

     Within weeks of setting off a geiger counter and scrubbing three
     layers of skin off his hands and arms, former Navy quartermaster
     Maurice Enis recalled being pressured to sign away U.S. government
     liability for any future health problems.

     Enis and about 5,000 fellow sailors aboard the USS Ronald Reagan
     aircraft carrier had finally left Japan, after 80-some days aiding
     victims of the March 11, 2011, Fukushima earthquake and tsunami, and
     were about to take a long-awaited port call in Thailand.

     But first, they were told they needed to fill out some paperwork.

     "They had us sign off that we were medically fine, had no sickness,
     and that we couldn't sue the U.S. government," Enis told The
     Huffington Post, recalling widespread anger among the sailers who
     saw it as "B.S." but who also felt they had little choice.

       Making them sign away future health problems from radiation

   everyone play like Jerry Garcia." I wasn't amused at the analogy,
   personally.

   I get the complimentary analogy. What I don't like is what an AR-15 has
   come to symbolize, and how polar opposite that symbolism is to that of
   Garcia, for me.

   Garcia changed my life for the better, immeasurably. An AR-15 changed a

   Nothing. Not a thing.

   That's what's so especially maddening about all this bullshit.

   Simpson and Bowles are ratfuckers, not reformers. They would cut a new
   report as soon as their old blueprint was embraced into real world
   policy. That's what bad faith ratfuckers do. They act in bad faith and
   fuck you over.

   Democrats get less than nothing actually, because the follow up to a
   "Grand Bargain" is the tsunami of shit they will eat afterwards for
   giving the GOP what they want for bad faith in return.

   I think, as the idiocy comes up again and again and again, we should
   realize that a "Grand Bargain" is insane on both a political as well as
   a policy level.

   You are doing any Democrat who might be open to such stupidity because
   they haven't been outside of the beltway for too long a huge favor by
   making as much noise as possible opposing the idea.

   You get no deficit reduction, because the GOP doesn't give a shit about
   the Deficit. Anything you do that saves money on paper, or worse,
   creates the impression that there is, will be used to stoke the tax cut
   now fire of the next maga tax cut push.

   You will never "take x, y, and z off the table once and for all" with
   any deal. Social Security must be destroyed because... it exists.
   That's enough for the Right. Teahadism is not a good faith disagreement
   on policy, it's deranged ideological fundamentalism. Sign off on cuts,
   and the bar gets lowered and the goal posts get moved. You can't agree
   to a deal that ends this cycle. No matter how draconian or cruel. They
   will be back in a year or two with new demands. They are trying to
   destroy Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid, not trying to preserve
   it. This is a bad faith movement.

   So, you not only don't get an end to the war on the Social Safety Net.
   You might even encourage the Right to double down on doing it all again
   next year.

   You probably couldn't come up with a better Democratic turn-out
   suppression device in an already tough off year Senate election, short
   of starting a war with Iran the way the Bushies did with Iraq, than
   social safety net cuts that will be entirely put on the Democrats door
   by the Republicans who vote for them. But social safety net cuts, which
   the GOP will attack you for later, put on the table to beg bad faith
   Movement Conservative Republicans to accept 90's era Movement
   Conservative Republican tax policies? Policies that they are only
   rejecting now because they are "liberal" as the Kenyan Socialist
   Usurper has embraced them? That's fucking insane. Anything conservative
   Obama embraces is nothing more than a signal to move the goalposts
   further to the Right as the old Right is the new middle.

   Politically, what President Obama and the Democratic Congressional
   caucuses get out of a "Grand Bargain" are a huge backlash including
   longterm damage to the party brand, a Republican Senate, an increased
   Republican House caucus, and Senator Ted Cruz with a gavel to go along
   with getting blamed for Movement Conservative policy outcomes on the
   Social Safety net that they get exclusively blamed for by the Village
   and the GOP that clamored for the cuts in the first place.

   What a deal.

   The only thing that could lead us to finding ourselves watching the
   attempted impeachment of Barack Obama is... such a deal.

   Bonus fail, the general public is so fucking ignorant and uninformed
   that you won't even get temporary smoke and mirrors credit for even a
   brief time from any of the austerity fairy tales you've told yourself
   will arrive if you do "the hard choices".

 "Working Class" - makes me think of Richard Trumka ([681]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   the other day -- seeming to muse about reaching out in more and better
   ways to unionize workers.

   It seemed to me that Trumka was acknowledging the possibility that
   unions may be out of step with many of today's workers.

   The phrase "working class" just drove that home for me.

   Today's working class includes a lot of people you'd expect: truck
   drivers, construction workers, retail workers, factory workers, etc.

   But -- what about free-lance web developers and illustrators?
   What about people bringing in money from side jobs restoring old cars
   or running an eBay store?

   It's not quite as simple as asking yourself if you are Mitt Romney or
   see him down at the Club, but...

   in an economy where bits generate fortune, how different are QA
   testers, tech support folk, developers, deisgners, etc from
   pipe-fitters, inspectors, and die-makers?

   Maybe we should just call all of us "Not the Mitt".

       and bureaucrats who needed to work but were in the "middle" between
       the rich --who didn't need to work-- and the working classes, who
       needed to work but had no interesting prospects.
       The New Deal era here, and other developments offshore (some before
       us) brought the Middle Class lifestyle to much of the working
       classes. That included the prospects for upward mobility, of
       leaving an inheritance for children, for higher education, leisure
       time, travel and a secure old age.
       Those are not reasonable prospects for the working classes, except
       when advanced economies are massively regulated to facilitate them.
       It was outright propaganda to begin calling America's enhanced
       working classes "middle" class. Middle income has never mostly been
       middle class.

 "Grand Bargain" ([786]0+ / 0-)

   A "Grand Bargain" that makes life better for the working class? Surely
   you jest, Meteor Blades!!!

   Obama and his BFFs, the Rethuglicans, cannot have that!! The
   Rethuglicans can't have that because they're too busy making life
   better for their constituents, the 1%

   And Obama CERTAINLY cannot have that because he's too busy trying to
   secure his legacy with those whose opinions matter to him the most: the
   beltway pundits, Third Way and Wall Street.

   Get with the program, Meteor Blades!!!

   Voting patterns have me worried because it shows that Obama's coalition
   is flakey as turnout in the last election was high in swing states but
   lower in other states, as if the president is the only reason to vote.
   I suspect that as off year elections are viewed to be less important,
   turnout for infrequent voters will stay inconsistent.

   My guess is that there's no faith in consistent turnout so these
   progressives are being totally ignored. Maybe that is poetic justice in
   a way, if you are too dumb to exercise the power that you have then you
   get what you deserve. Not talking about kos but those infrequent voters
   that many point to in polls that supposedly show a left leaning
   country.

   I'd argue that non voters don't count, so of the real voters, what do
   they think takes precedence. Off year elections have more conservative
   voters, and policy seems to reflect that. Too much focus on the
   deficit? These off year voters care about that, even though they are
   against any specific cuts that are mentioned.

   I also notice that Obama has a tough time with his message when he
   cannot talk in front of the public in speeches. During these times the
   media paints Obama as really tone deaf that drives liberals crazy until
   they hear him speak and folks calm down.  That is clearly not a liberal
   media. We are definetly in that non speech cycle right now so everybody
   is acting paranoid (whether justified or not).

   Grand Bargin for the working class, well no. Minorities might benefit,
   so in this zero sum game we call life, we must all go down together
   while the 1% rules. There's royalty, and then there's us serfs.

 As long as pay is unrelated to productivity ... ([793]0+ / 0-)

   You expect anything but delusional thinking in DC?

     effectively the bipartisan consensus approach is the special sort of
     Beltway madness that makes sensible people wish for either a proper
     parliamentary system or at the very least for an EMP to take out
     Georgetown and much of Washington's surrounding suburbs.

   There's a reason I ignored party politics from 1979 to 2000.

   to:

     That the opposite approach is effectively the bipartisan consensus
     approach is the special sort of Beltway madness that makes sensible
     people wish for either a proper parliamentary system or at the very
     least for an EMP to take out Georgetown and much of Washington's
     surrounding suburbs.

   They weren't born here, hardly any went to school here, and
   increasingly the real asshats are proud they have no permanent address
   here. They were all, with the exception of a few suburban House
   memebers, sent here from out there.

   EMP Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma and such other senders of idiots to
   Congress to take out the real problem here. Most of us in fairly deep
   blue suburbs and the deepest blue of all, occupied D.C. where the
   license plate reads "Taxation without representation" because it is not
   allowed a vote in Congress, will cheer. Hell, I'll even put on a party
   hat and act giddy.

   "Washington" ain't the problem. That lies in the places that send us
   largely progressive folk such bumbling, often ignorant and pompous
   fools who often brag they fly in on Monday and out on Friday evening.

   The only foes that threaten America are the enemies at home, and those
   are ignorance, superstition, and incompetence. [Elbert Hubbard]

   Recommended by:
          [802]OleHippieChick, [803]JeffW

   Running for political office has become a game of simply chasing money.
    The Republicans have no source other than the narrow percent of rich
   folks and the pawns they've propegandized into voting for them. So they
   simply cannot do a "grand compromise" and keep their jobs.

 Something that should be in the "grand bargain" ([806]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   that would help the working class is raising the minimum wage.

   Increasing wages would increase government revenues without raising tax
   rates or government expenditures, and it would reduce the necessity for
   social programs.  Increasing revenues and reducing social programs
   would reduce the deficit.  For those reasons, Republicans should love
   the idea, especially its reliance on the private sector to solve a
   problem.

 that part about offering Republicans an ([810]0+ / 0-)

   opportunity to achieve their stated objective of "entitlement reform"
   and help them show Americans that that support strengthening
   entitlement programs would be brilliant, if only the President could,
   somehow, sell them on that. This presumes that Republicans are
   predisposed to reasoned thinking. Am not sure that's the case.

   Unfortunately, when Republicans use the word "reform," asn in
   "entitlement reform," they mean it in only the most Orwellian way, as
   in, "killing entitlements" or at least weakening so they can be easily
   killed off sometime in the distant future.

   In any case...it would truly be one of the biggest political
   achievements in a generation if the President could somehow convince
   Republicans to go along with true "entitlement reforms" that actually
   reform and strenthen them (such as reducing or eliminating the FICA cap
   for Social Security, letting Medicare negotiate for lower drug costs,
   making Medicare and Social Security recipients earning more than a
   million dollars a year in income pay higher co-pays).

   The political solution may well be to appeal to the Republicans' baser
   instincts...by convincing them that they would be likely to improve
   their party image to a lot of people by demonstrating that they
   actually want to improve entitlements, rather than just gut them.
