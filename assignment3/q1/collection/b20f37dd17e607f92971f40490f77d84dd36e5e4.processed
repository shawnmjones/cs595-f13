   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Bipartisan group of senators announce an agreement
     * NEW: Plan would cap rates on many types of student loans
     * NEW: Senate will vote on plan "as quickly as possible," says Reid
     * Sen. Tom Harkin, whose support is key, agreed to the deal

   Washington (CNN) -- A bipartisan group of senators announced an
   agreement on a student loans package Thursday that would cap rates,
   ending a standoff that lasted months and broke through a July 1
   deadline for finding a solution.

   Under the compromise measure, undergraduate students would pay a rate
   of 3.85% next year on subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans. The
   plan would cap rates on loans to undergrads at 8.25%, for graduate
   students at 9.5% and parents at 10.5%.

   "While this is not the agreement that any of us would have written, and
   many of us would like to have seen something quite different, I believe
   we have come a very long way on reaching common ground," Sen. Dick
   Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip in the Senate, said at a press
   conference Thursday.

   Sen. Tom Harkin, the Democratic chairman of the committee that oversees
   federal education programs, also was present in announcing the deal.
   The Iowa senator had resisted for weeks agreeing to a plan unless it
   included caps on how high the interest rates on the loans could rise.

   Speaking after Thursday's news conference, Harkin said lawmakers may
   revisit the student loans issue when his committee wades into altering
   the Higher Education Act in the next several months.

   Even as Harkin praised the deal, he said he might reopen it as early as
   next year.

   "Can we change it? Sure we can change it," Harkin told reporters. "This
   is not the Ten Commandments written in stone for God's sake."

   "If we don't pass a Higher Education Act at least there is certainty in
   the future. If we pass a Higher Education Act, we might want to leave
   it the same we might want to change it a little bit. I don't know," he
   continued.

   Republicans praised the plan. Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma called it a
   "win-win for both students and taxpayers."

   "Tying interest rates to the market allows students to take advantage
   of historically low rates while ensuring taxpayers will not have to
   foot the bill for arbitrary rates set by Congress," he said.

   Student loan rates doubled July 1 from 3.4% to 6.8% after Congress
   failed to reach a deal averting the increase.

   The agreement, if approved by the full Senate, would tie interest rates
   on a variety of government-backed loans to 10-year Treasury notes and
   would lock in surcharges paid to the government for administrative
   costs.

   Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the upper chamber would vote on
   the deal "as quickly as possible."

   The White House, which has been heavily involved in negotiations, backs
   the agreement, a Senate Democratic leadership aide said.
