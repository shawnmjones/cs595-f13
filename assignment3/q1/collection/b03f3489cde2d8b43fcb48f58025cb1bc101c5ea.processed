Intercepted al Qaeda message led to shuttering embassies, consulates

   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: The U.S. State Department extends closures of some diplomatic
       posts
     * An intercepted al Qaeda message led to the closing of embassies and
       consulates

   (CNN) -- An intercepted message among senior al Qaeda operatives in the
   last several days raised alarm bells that led to the closing of
   embassies and consulates Sunday across the Middle East and North
   Africa, CNN has learned.

   CNN has agreed to a request from an Obama administration official not
   to publish or broadcast additional details because of the sensitivity
   of the information.

   Several U.S. officials also emphasized they have been watching growing
   threats emerging from Yemen for weeks.

   Those threats, combined with the coming end of the month of Ramadan,
   plus the concern over several major prison breaks in the region, all
   contributed to the U.S. decision to shut down diplomatic installations.

   [41]Officials shuttered 22 U.S. embassies and consulates for the day on
   Sunday amid fears of an al Qaeda attack. On Sunday afternoon, the State
   Department said it had extended embassy and consulate closures in 15 of
   the locations until Friday and added four other posts to the list.

   "This is not an indication of a new threat stream," the State
   Department said, "merely an indication of our commitment to exercise
   caution and take appropriate steps to protect our employees, including
   local employees, and visitors to our facilities."

   Embassy closings Embassy closings
   Terror threat prompts embassy closures
   Central Asia cause of embassy threat
   Potential terror threat in Mideast

   The widespread closure of diplomatic posts is an unprecedented move.

   "We're doing what is necessary to protect our people," Rep. Adam
   Schiff, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's
   State of the Union on Sunday.

   The closures stretch across a swath of Africa and the Middle East -- as
   far west as Mauritania, as far south as Madagascar and as far east as
   Oman. A U.S. global travel alert is also in place.

   As White House and national security officials [42]met to discuss the
   threat and U.S. military forces in the Middle East were put on a higher
   state of alert, Interpol warned that [43]al Qaeda has been tied to
   prison breaks in the region that led to the escape of hundreds of
   terrorists and other criminals.

   It's unclear what locations are targeted by the apparent terror plot,
   U.S. lawmakers said Sunday.

   "I think we know a lot more about the when than the where. And you can
   tell that from the breadth of the closures across North Africa and the
   Arabian Peninsula," Schiff said. "But the when was very specific in
   terms of a Sunday. Obviously, that may continue and the closures may
   continue. The travel warning is more extensive. But this is not the
   usual kind of chatter, not the more generalized 'death to the
   Americans' or 'death to great Satan.' "

   CNN national security analyst Fran Fragos Townsend said there could be
   a strategic reason for shutting down the diplomatic offices.

   "Once you take targets away, it buys you additional time to try and
   disrupt, to identify the cell, the operators in country and the region,
   and work with your partners in the region to try and, you know, get
   them in custody or disrupt the plot," she said. "So, some of this
   operationally is about buying time."

   Of particular concern is Yemen, where the government is "on high alert
   against possible attacks in the days to come," said a senior U.S.
   security official.

   [44]Official: Security tightened in Yemen

   Over the weekend, the security around the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was
   even tighter than last year, when protesters raided it. At least 12
   tanks were stationed within 500 meters of the building.

   Britain, France and Germany also closed their embassies in the Yemeni
   capital, Sanaa, on Sunday and Monday for security reasons. No other
   embassies are affected, they said.

   Western targets under threat

   "The threat appears to be much worse than it has (been) in a long
   time," said a senior U.S. security official in Yemen.

   Various Western targets -- not just those tied to the United States --
   are under threat, two U.S. officials said.

   Three sources said the United States has information that members of al
   Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are in the final stages of planning for
   an unspecified attack.

   One of the sources said such preparations appeared to have increased in
   recent days, with the approaching end of the Muslim holy month of
   Ramadan. Sunday is Laylet al-Qadr, or the Night of Power, one of the
   holiest moments on the Muslim calendar.

   Said one U.S. official: "It all leads us to believe something could
   happen in the near future."

   Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee,
   told CBS' "Face the Nation" Sunday that it was "one of the most
   specific and credible threats I've seen perhaps since 9/11."

   "Because of the specificity, because of where it is coming from, the
   credibility of it, the level of chatter, it seems to be a fairly large
   operation," he said. "It's giving the intelligence community quite a
   bit of pause right now."

   fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador and three other U.S.
   nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration
   initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked
   Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the
   consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack. View photos of

   Concerns about Yemen

   U.S. officials said that based on intelligence, they were particularly
   concerned about the U.S. Embassy in Yemen between Saturday and Tuesday.
   President Barack Obama, amid regular updates on the situation, has
   directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect Americans.

   Hundreds of additional security forces were deployed, and roads leading
   to the embassy were closed. Checkpoints were set up at a distance from
   the embassy, and trucks weren't allowed to pass anywhere near the main
   embassy road.

   Yemen's special forces, the most elite, were seen in small numbers near
   the embassy as well.

   The UK Foreign Office has also warned its citizens against travel to
   Yemen, and it urged British nationals to leave as soon as possible.

   "If you don't leave the country now while commercial carriers are still
   flying, it is extremely unlikely that the British government will be
   able to evacuate you or provide consular assistance," it said.

   In Sanaa, some said concerns about attacks were overblown.

   Wagdi Al-Absi, a university professor based there, told CNN that the
   threats and warnings are exaggerated.

   "Al Qaeda was a real threat and very powerful in Yemen two years ago.
   Still, embassies did not close," he said. "Today, when al Qaeda is
   handicapped, the West considers them a real threat. It's the total
   opposite.

   "Streets in Yemen are normal, and security forces are always on the
   watch. That is why al Qaeda attacks in the capital are not common."

   Time of attack unknown

   The expected time of an attack is unknown, which explains why a
   [45]U.S. travel alert extends through August.

   "Terrorists may elect to use a variety of means and weapons and target
   both official and private interests," the alert states. "U.S. citizens
   are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public
   transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure."

   U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York, a member of the House Intelligence
   Committee, called the information "the most specific I've seen."

   While the principal attention is on the Arabian Peninsula, he stressed
   to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that "we can't rule anything out."

   "We are focused on the Middle East, but it's a potential series of
   attacks that really could be almost anyplace," King said.

   U.S. forces on alert

   Select U.S. military forces in the Middle East were put on a higher
   state of alert.

   Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel held a series of high-level meetings at
   the Pentagon "to take a look at what forces we have in the region" that
   can be used if there is an attack, a U.S. official told CNN.

   These forces are at "quite a high state of readiness achieved only a
   handful of times in the last year," the official said. He declined to
   be specific, but two other officials have told CNN that U.S. Navy
   amphibious ships in the Red Sea last week moved closer to Yemen.

   There are also combat-equipped Marines in southern Spain and southern
   Italy that could begin moving in as little as one hour from getting
   orders.

   The U.S. military has taken similar action in recent months, especially
   at times of unrest in Yemen and Egypt. These forces in the Red Sea,
   Spain and Italy have been regularly deployed to these areas since last
   year's attack in Benghazi, Libya, when the U.S. military did not have
   forces nearby.

   Unprecedented move

   Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, told CNN he had
   never seen embassy closures ordered across such a broad area.

   "There have been incidents where they've closed down a number of
   embassies in the Middle East because the information is not specific
   enough to say that 'embassy X' got to be closed as opposed to other
   embassies," said Hill, who joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1977.

   "But I think this, closing all of these embassies in the Middle East to
   North Africa, is in fact unprecedented. At least, I didn't see this
   during my career."

   Concerns after Benghazi

   House leaders have been briefed, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told
   reporters, adding that the travel alert and embassy closings provided
   "some understanding of the seriousness of the threat."

   King, who has also heard such briefings, applauded the government's
   decision to close its diplomatic missions.

   "I give them credit," the Republican said of the Obama administration.
   "I think the government is doing exactly the right thing here."

   Such bipartisan agreement in Washington comes at a time when
   politicians are still scrutinizing the September 11, 2012, attack on
   the U.S. consular compound in Benghazi, which killed four Americans,
   including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

   Since then, Republicans have been pressing Obama's administration for
   answers, with some accusing officials of covering up what happened in
   Benghazi and not doing enough to track down the attackers.

   Eight GOP lawmakers are asking that incoming FBI Director James Comey
   brief Congress within 30 days about the investigation. They say the
   administration's inquiry to date has been "simply unacceptable,"
   according to a draft letter obtained by CNN.

   Earlier last week, Vice President Joe Biden and senior State Department
   officials went to Congress to discuss embassy security.

   Biden also briefed congressional leadership, key committee chairmen and
   ranking members about the latest threat concerns, a source who attended
   the meeting said.

   Another official said the recent intelligence might not have warranted
   such a response before the Benghazi attack, which created a political
   firestorm for the administration.

   On Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the agency
   was taking the steps out of an abundance of caution.
