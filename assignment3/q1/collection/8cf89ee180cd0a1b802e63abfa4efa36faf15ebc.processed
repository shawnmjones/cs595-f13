[23]The renewed war on the veteran teacher

   Teacher and female student at the blackboard with clock drawing on it.
   Last Wednesday, my son, like so many youngsters around the country,
   began his second year of instruction at a local middle school tucked
   away in suburban southern California. Though the name and the exact
   location have changed, it is essentially the same middle school that
   both my wife and I attended roughly a quarter-century ago.

   By and large, the names and faces of the faculty have changed since the
   (ahem) late 1980s. But, there has been one constant, and my wife and I
   could not have been happier to see that my son's 7th grade social
   studies teacher was, indeed, the same woman who had taught both of us
   all those years ago.

   Indeed, she has been doing so for over a half century now. Yes ... you
   read the preceding sentence correctly.

   When she hit the 50-year mark last year, there was a torrent of praise
   in the community. Deservedly so. After all, how many lives in this town
   of 30,000 or so had been enriched by her lifelong commitment to
   children and education?

   Alas, not everyone feels that way. Indeed, the level of respect
   afforded to those who have devoted their adult lives to the education
   of children has diminished to the point that the prevailing zeitgeist
   suggests that comparably junior members of the profession are somehow
   inherently superior to their more experienced colleagues.

   If it seems like I have travelled down this road before, it because
   [30]I have. Eighteen months ago, I wrote about how "tenure reform" was
   an attack on veteran teachers and their employment rights, wrapped in
   the cloak of "improving education" for kids.

   But this new trend is far more sinister. Now, the "reform" crowd
   (including an alarming number that sell themselves as progressives)
   don't merely want the ability to fire veteran teachers. They want to
   strip them of something that has greater intangible value: their status
   as mentors and role models for the profession.

   Follow me below the fold for the explanation.

   [31]Herein lies "the future of education":

     Tyler Dowdy just started his third year of teaching at YES Prep
     West, a charter school [in Houston, TX]. He figures now is a good
     time to explore his next step, including applying for a supervisory
     position at the school.

     Mr. Dowdy is 24 years old, which might make his restlessness seem
     premature. But then, his principal is 28. Across YES Prep's 13
     schools, teachers have an average of two and a half years of
     experience.

   This isn't a bug, ladies and gentlemen. It's a feature, as one of the
   directors of this particular charter school organization made clear
   later in the piece:

     "We have this highly motivated, highly driven work force who are now
     wondering, `O.K., I've got this, what's the next thing?' " said
     Jennifer Hines, senior vice president of people and programs at YES
     Prep. "There is a certain comfort level that we have with people who
     are perhaps going to come into YES Prep and not stay forever."

     The notion of a foreshortened teaching career was largely introduced
     by Teach for America, which places high-achieving college graduates
     into low-income schools for two years. Today, Teach for America
     places about a third of its recruits in charter schools.

     "Strong schools can withstand the turnover of their teachers," said
     Wendy Kopp, the founder of Teach for America. "The strongest schools
     develop their teachers tremendously so they become great in the
     classroom even in their first and second years."

   The premise here, in both cases, is simply insulting. As someone who
   has been in the classroom for 17 years, I can tell you that any
   second-year teacher who really thinks "Okay, I've got this" is most
   likely (a) painfully arrogant and (b) completely wrong.

   But it is telling, is it not, that people who claim to be all about
   education are so dismissive about how easy the profession is?

   Are there any other important professions that people would be so
   casually dismissive? Does anyone say, "Hey, forget about David Boies.
   He's been around too long. I want this kid just out of Boalt Law School
   when I go before the Supreme Court. He's been doing this for two years,
   but he says that he's 'got this.'"

   Of course, if your entire ethos (inherent in both the charter school
   community and TFA, which critics often joke should stand for "Teach For
   Awhile") is predicated on inexperienced staff, the only way to lend
   credibility to your cause is to make the argument that experience is
   irrelevant.

   But, in recent years, the argument has grown far deeper, and far more
   sinister, than that. The argument has essentially become that
   experience is a detriment to quality education.

   Consider the [32]framing of the argument found in this article in this
   week's Atlanta Journal-Constitution (which, in fairness, is a very
   balanced discussion of the subject):

     Are veteran teachers better than novice ones as a result of their
     time in the trenches or are new teachers more enthusiastic and open
     to change?

     A national researcher once [argued] that the most effective year for
     teaching is around year 7, a point at which teachers are experienced
     enough to have mastered classroom management and crowd control but
     are still young and optimistic enough to avoid the calcification
     into seething resentment that can come from the indignities and
     pitfalls of the profession.

   The "reform" crowd has long addressed the issue of veteran teachers as
   a battle between "youth and optimism" and "calcification and
   resentment." Not only is the argument offensive, it is also wrong.
   There have been multiple studies that confirm that [33]teacher
   effectiveness is enhanced through experience. What's more, a 2012 study
   showed that [34]teacher turnover (a built-in feature of charter
   schools, as we read earlier) does appear to have a negative impact on
   student performance.

   But there are other, more obvious reasons for the "reform" crowd to
   diminish the value of experienced teachers.

   The most obvious one is money. Experienced teachers simply cost more
   than their less experienced colleagues.

   But of equal importance is that experienced teachers are often the most
   vocal and impassioned voices for the rights of professional teachers.

   Do not underestimate how much the "reform" community loathes the role
   veteran teachers play in acting as the guardians of the professional
   rights of teachers. Much of the intellectual heft, and virtually all of
   the money, in the "reform" crowd comes from the financial and business
   elite. For example, when Wendy Kopp founded TFA, she did so by pitching
   her plan to Fortune 500 execs. That netted her the seed money needed
   ($2.5 million) to get her plan off the ground.

   So the "reform" movement (and the charter school movement) is fueled by
   corporate cash and wealthy donors. This is a shock to precisely no one.
   Now, ponder for a moment how that crowd typically conceives of its
   workforce, and then see the obvious translation to "education reform."

   One undeniable component of that corporate mindset in education
   "reform" (and the charter school movement) is an ingrained hatred of
   workers' rights in the classroom. Even in their own [35]propaganda, the
   charter school lobby admits that less than one-in-eight charter schools
   are unionized. There is no chance of that being an accident.

   And that allows the charter school movement to place often outrageous
   demands on its employees, without fear of conflict. The NYT profile on
   charter schools points out, as one example, the fact that teachers at
   the YES charter schools are issued cellphones by the school, and are
   told they have to be available to tutor students via phone at virtually
   all hours of the day (the article specifies that faculty are obligated
   to take calls until 9 PM).

   Charter schools need a weakened workforce, dependent upon the goodwill
   of the bosses, in order to insist on things like demanding that
   employees offer up to 30 additional hours a week of uncompensated
   labor. In short, they need a bunch of temp workers, who would never
   dare challenge the authority structure, because they are more
   interested in getting a decent recommendation letter to the MBA program
   in their future than they are to upholding some minimal rights for the
   profession, since it is a profession that is viewed merely as an
   attractive line on their bio for whatever is next in their future.

   In contrast, veteran teachers are confident enough in their
   convictions, and have a broad enough depth of experiences, to question
   the inherent value of "reforms," especially when said reforms are
   coming from people with scant, if any, classroom experience. What's
   more, they are fiercely protective of the profession, because they know
   that they are in it for the long haul. The part-timers will not fight,
   because either (a) they don't care because they're looking at the next
   rung of the ladder or (b) they're afraid. Neither of those things apply
   to veteran teachers, which is why they will fight.

   That's why the "reform" community views veteran teachers as a threat,
   and it explains why they are so interested in diminishing their value
   to the educational process.

   Which is a damned shame, because a sane society would honor the voices
   of the people who spend decades in the trenches, rather than the people
   who, at most, spent a year or two in the classroom and then assumed
   that they gained all the knowledge necessary in that small sampling of
   classroom experiences. Really, this shouldn't be a debate. But it is,
   and that speaks volumes about the perilous state of American public
   education.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health

   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       topic. As a teacher in the 14th year of my career and 9th at my
       current school, I cannot say enough times how important my
       experiences have been in improving my craft. To see the deformers
       in education attack experience like some form of cancer is
       disgusting and threatening. I truly hope you, and a few of the more
       well-spoken educational vets around here, are around to combat the
       appearance of the usual group of dupes and trolls that attack DKos
       education articles.
       Again, thank you.

       I can tell you from my own experience and observations of newer
       teachers that it take 5 or 6 years to become pretty good at this.
       During this time period many teachers quit because the job is too
       hard or they find out it is not for them.
       I also know that most teachers continue to learn and become better
       at their craft as the years go on.  I am currently in my second
       year of my third master's program.  I don't need the degree, but I
       am learning so much about teaching that didn't exist 30 years ago
       it is well worth it.
       We need to make education a more competitive field, better pay and
       higher requirements for perspective teachers.  Yes, there may be
       some bad teachers out there but we are driving off many good ones
       by cheapening education.

       As one who loved teaching, I warn bright young people away from
       teaching because the field has become a nightmare.  30 hours of
       slave labour?  Why would any parent want someone stupid enough to
       accept such treatment, teaching their children?  Its time to call
       things what they are instead of indulging in words that hide the
       truth.  When one human being owns the labor of another, it is
       slavery.  These assholes are counting on the old story of married
       women for whom work is secondary.  Yes, I know this concerns men as
       well, but the idea is an old pre-feminist notion and women have
       been complicit in allowing it to linger.  Men in the field have
       been victimized by it by association.  The whole business demeans
       teachers and, whether we like to admit it or not, women.
       What is really grating is that many of the people in industry who
       have cheered for these changes, wouldn't consider sending their own
       offspring to such second rate schools.  This is also a class
       battle.

       few years I have been trying to move back to PA.  I have most of my
       teaching information on a job site that emails me when a job in
       science is open.  At first I was surprised when I saw all of the
       jobs, at least 3-4 every week, from charter schools once the school
       year started.  And the emails kept on coming through the whole
       school year.  I can only imagine that the working conditions are so
       poor that many teachers quit during the school year.

       Like the infamous "welfare queens" narrative to slash the social

       There are no "universally competent" employees in any profession.
       However, after teaching in five schools within two different
       states, I have had just two colleagues that I would deem as the
       older teacher who is unwilling to be a part of the team.
       On the other hand, I have served as a mentor educator and have seen
       new teachers struggle for the first several years of teaching as
       they learn classroom management and other essential skills.  I have
       also seen some with lots of enthusiasm, but little knowledge of
       their content area.
       The education system relies on the seasoned teacher to provide the
       support for the schools, particularly with the plethora of MBA-type
       young administrators that are being hired.  The ever-changing
       educational landscape requires the "wise vet teacher" to balance
       out the push for new "reforms."
       Sometimes, it's best to not to engage in assumptions.

 One is as much of a myth as the other ([544]0+ / 0-)
       My comment was in response to the comment that implied that
       crotchety senior teachers are a myth.  Well, that's ridiculous.  A
       certain fraction, in my experience 20-30% of long-term teachers,
       are way past their shelf life.
       They ruin it for the kids, for the parents, and for the other
       teachers, who I would think would be especially motivated to herd
       them into retirement asap.
       Note that I believe the large majority of teachers do not fall into
       that category.

 Home Town ([548]0+ / 0-)
       In my home town crotchety old pseudo-feminist elementary school
       teachers, neglected and punished boys for being boys.  They were
       particularly hard on African American boys (that often had lower
       levels of support at home), and sent many down the wrong path.  I
       say pseudo-feminist, because they believed in putting males into
       subservient roles to them, not bringing everyone (male and female)
       to the same high level.

   Infuriate me. What do you do for a living, Be Skeptical? Are you
   universally competent and wise? If not; if you simply have experience
   that your neophyte colleagues don't, which makes you better at many
   aspects of your job; don't you agree that you really need to be
   replaced by someone who is younger, more energetic, willing to work for
   less money, and perfectly happy to change jobs every couple of years?

   I am reminded of a poster on another site who blamed teachers for the
   suicide of a teenager who was bullied on Facebook. Because (I
   paraphrase, but you might be astonished to find how slightly) "every
   teacher is obligated to be aware of the social, familial, and personal
    lives of the 75-100 students (in high schools, at least) that he or
   she teaches." Including their Facebook activities, apparently. He
   continued, "Teachers who can't handle that should be summarily fired."

   I love my job, which involves teaching kids who have IQs in the 68-75
   range (but are expected to pass the same standardized tests that the AP
   and Honors kids take). Guess why I'm working on an M.S. in Health
   Information Technology? And why, after ten years of good-to-excellent
   performance reviews, I'll be quitting as soon as the degree is
   completed?

   If I have misunderstood your "myth of the universally competent yet
   wise teacher" comment, I sincerely apologize; and I'm not really
   directing this rant at you.  There may be a few of those out there, but
   no one is claiming that about all veteran teachers. A lot of people,
   however, are buying into the myth of the "hidebound, resistant to
   change, disaffected, indifferent, veteran teachers who needs to be
   summarily replaced," and I'm very tired of it.

       I would never have made it otherwise.  It just irritates me when it
       is implied that all long-term teachers are highly competent.
       That's the source of my pique.   Because you're right--in every
       profession there are people who are crappy workers, or worn out, or
       irresponsible, or lazy.  Yet it seems taboo to state that teachers
       are no exception.
       I think people who have had their child stuck in a classroom for a
       year with one of those lousy teachers is going to be a lot more
       sensitive about that experience than the time they had to deal with
       the incompetent airline ticket agent or the hours-late repair guy.
        It is the rare student (and parent) who has not had to endure one
       of those lost education years.  And that's infuriating.  I would
       hope good teachers feel the same and would favor measures to reduce
       those bad apple numbers to as low as possible.

 The problem is when people start saying ([563]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [564]elfling

       that a certain percentage of teachers--whether experienced or
       new--are bad.  It differs by location.
       I've worked for principals who are really good at hiring well
       qualified teachers.  My current one always seems to hit the
       jackpot.  Part of the success is that grade level teams are in on
       the interviews.  There is great emphasis in my district for
       teachers to collaborate so it makes sense that a team would want a
       new member that will operate well within that team.  We also have a
       number of school wide initiatives and it's important that any new
       staff members buy into them for them to be successful.
       I also work in a district that has more applicants than positions.
        It happens to be the highest paying district in my state and when
       you have so many applicants, you can usually choose more qualified
       people.  The county next to us has the opposite problem.  They have
       a teacher shortage and have had to import them from the
       Philippines.
       In my 38 years, I can honestly say that I've worked with 3 people
       that should not be in the classroom.  One was a middle aged person
       who was a new teacher.  Our principal got her out within the first
       year.  Another was a burn out who retired.  The third was a special
       ed teacher with about 15 years experience who left our school.  I
       have no idea what became of her.  The worst teacher my kids had was
       9th grade English teacher with 3 years experience who quit at the
       end of the year.  The best one was their 9th grade social studies
       teacher who had 25 years experience and who had been a student at
       the same school.  Some kids though he was "mean" but he
       consistently held high expectations and he was the only high school
       teacher that ever called us with any concerns.
       I've worked with teachers that I thought were "crotchety" but they
       got the job done.  While I would prefer that kids all have
       nurturing teachers, they do have to learn to get along with all
       types of personalities.  If the teacher is ultimately a decent
       teacher, "grouchiness" shouldn't necessarily matter--certainly not
       to the testing fanatics.
       Principals can control who works at their school whether the
       teachers are union or not.

 Our school also does interviews with ([568]0+ / 0-)
       teachers and parents and classified staff on the panel. And if none
       of the applicants gets the approval of the panel, the posting goes
       back up for another round. Our district doesn't pay well but the
       environment is very nice to work in and class sizes are small.
       Are there districts that don't have teachers on their panels?

 Emmanuel hired ([710]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [711]Calamity Jean

   Jean Claud Brizard, the superintendent of the Rochester, NY, City
   School District away from Rochester a couple of years ago.
   Mr. Brizard was a very divisive and controversial superintendent in
   Rochester, whom the EEOC found of violating federal age-discrimination
   laws. (He fired a well-respected female administrator after expressing
   contempt for the competence of older women teachers/administrators.)
   The district, always cash-strapped, found itself the object of civil
   lawsuits based not only on age discrimination, but also on sex and race
   discrimination.
   There was some question about the legality of Chicago's hiring someone
   who had violated federal law, but Emmanuel was determined to stand by
   his man.
   Brizard left Rochester quite suddenly to immense relief throughout the
   system.
   Like Michelle Rhee, he always claimed he had the secret to turning
   student performance around.
   There was no evidence that actually happened.
   I figured he'd fit in well with Emmanuel and all the other celebrity
   reformers.

   for exactly this reason.  Every time I hear of starving school systems
   across that state -- with starving children lacking health care -- I
   harken back to the long con espoused by Republicans back in the 1980s
   and nurtured since:  "If minorities (even soon-to-be majority
   minorities) are going to vote Dem, we can at least keep them poor,
   poorly educated, and unhealthy, so they'll not be in a position to care
   about voting."

   No, it's not a CT, any more than their anti-science, anti-woman,
   anti-immigrant positions are CT.  But it's a trend we have to fight.

   And that fight is fundamentally limited since states and localities are
   in control of education.  Universal high-quality public education is
   almost a thing of the past.

       "Universal high-quality public education" has never existed in
       America.
       Universal education for kids with disabilities was not mandated
       until the mid 1970s.
       My classmates with last names that end in 'z' will tell you stories
       about having administrators change their schedules from calculus to
       woodshop.
       Low income kids, kids of color, kids who lived in poor
       neighborhoods have never been guaranteed anything. The education
       they got was more a matter of luck than universal intent.
       In the past, we educated fewer kids, and we cared less if they
       dropped out.

       Though we had a few youngsters with disabilities in my elementary
       classrooms (late 1950s-early 1960s in Huntsville AL), we
       mainstreamed them manually.  Two or three of us were asked (and not
       averse) to be stewards of an individual, for extensive tutorials in
       reading and arithmetic.  We seemed to be working together for group
       success, back in those days.  That may be selective memory, of
       course.  Most of my learning took place at home, out of books, and
       from my under-educated but highly intelligent parents.
       Our city schools weren't integrated until my senior year of high
       school ('68-'69), and there were few Hispanics noticed in our
       region at the time.  Of course, the teachers themselves were a
       highly diverse group, often spouses of engineers hired by NASA from
       all over the world.
       But you are absolutely right:  what we call 'universal public
       education' has never really lived up to the name, and its quality
       has been spotty at best -- unless your family was wealthy.

       Though I will say that in our case (I am sure methods vary), the
       decision on placement of student teachers is done by the department
       chairs (with administrative approval, of course). What's more, they
       are based on a number of factors, not the least of which is the
       schedule of the prospective student teachers versus the schedules
       of the teachers in the department.
       For example, in order to make sure I had a "representative"
       cross-section of experiences when I student-taught, I got hosed: my
       schedule was 1st and 2nd period economics, and then 5th period US
       History. That was horrible, because I was already coaching by then
       at a different school (my sole source of income at the time), and
       literally had to change clothes while driving to make it to
       practice on time.

   social/emotional learning which emphasizes the importance of
   student-teacher relationships.  Student-teacher relationships cannot
   happen when the teaching force is constantly changing.   I'm in my 38th
   year of teaching elementary school general music in public schools.
   This is my 29th year at my current school which is highly diverse and
   70% + free and reduced lunch.  Oten my students look to school for the
   stability in their lives.  Fortunately our staff seems to be in it for
   the long haul.  I've seen how our kids react when they start school
   only to find a favorite teacher has moved on.

   I am teaching kids whose parents I taught and their parents seem
   thrilled with that.  Fortunately I work in a large system which values
   experience.

   Thank you so much for writing this diary.

       The public school I attended in Missouri, and the one I taught at
       in another state, each had a music teacher.  But those teachers -
       and music itself, particularly as something for elementary school,
       is disappearing rapidly.  I'm glad the place where you teach has
       not succumbed to eliminating music, as has happened in many public
       schools here in Michigan, where I live now. It is, sadly, an easy
       target for de-funding.
       The importance of music to our lives, like so much of what happens
       in schools to bind communities together, to give children a sense
       of that community, is being deliberately tossed aside.
       I hope your work continues, and that there will be teachers who
       succeed you, when the day comes for you to retire.

   that considers the arts to be basic to a good education.  Our new
   curriculum is integrated across all content area including p.e., art
   and music.   One way it is integrated is in the teaching of specific
   higher order thinking and learning skills.  We live in an area that has
   rejected property tax cuts in order to maintain high quality schools.
   Our governor, has always been supportive of public education and has
   increased funding at a time when others were cutting funding.  He is
   very proud of the fact that our schools have ranked #1 in the Education
   Week rankings for the last 4 years.

   We also don't have charters and there has never been talk of vouchers.

   teaching grades 4-12. In addition to technique, in addition to
   following the state standards (which there are for art; the HS edition
   of this class is part of the UC entrance requirements), she also does
   amazing cool things like get the kids' work into juried art shows.

   I teach in my high school's "Occupational Course of Study" (for
   students with mild to moderate disabilities), as well as the
   College-Track Course of Study. The OCS program is small, and it
   requires the teacher to have certification in both High School English
   and Exceptional Children, and I'm the only faculty member who has both,
   so I teacher all four grades. I see the same kids each year: Sophomores
   to Juniors to Seniors. We all don't always get along perfectly well,
   because we're all very different people, but over the years we've built
   relationships.

   Little things make a difference: My students still get irritated when I
   call them on disruptive behavior, and I still get irritated when they
   make smart-ass comments or refuse to do an assignment. But we all kind
   of know how to handle each other.

   I also know them well enough to help new teachers who have these
   students in their own classes. For example, when students are
   corrected, if they mouth off or talk back, school rules say they get
   sent to the office. But one of my students has anger management issues,
   and copes with frustration by carrying on about how he wasn't doing
   whatever I said he was doing and it's totally unfair and stupid and he
   hates school and I'm just picking on him and so on. But he does it in a
   "clearly audible muttering" way; and it helps him "save face" while
   going ahead and doing what he's been asked to do. Because I know this
   about him, I have developed selective deafness in his case; and I can
   share this information with a teacher who hasn't taught him before.
   Everybody wins.

   I am not any sort of super-teacher; all of our students will go to
   their previous years' teachers for advice or to blow off steam. When
   you get a whole new slew of teachers each year, kids lose that
   connection, and their education suffers.

   Okay, I've ranted enough. Apologies for my vehemence, and for any
   rudeness I've directed at anyone. Thanks for writing this.

   even outside the classroom. College admissions offices know what
   schools (and even what teachers) produce good prospects. I was around
   so long the admissions officers knew my keywords in letters of
   recommendation and what strengths and weaknesses my students would have
   in subject matter.
   Kids knew what to expect. Younger siblings knew what to expect. Parents
   would tell their kids to remind me of "did my dad really do this?"
   stories.
   My success as a teacher was measured by the fact that the town, parents
   and students all knew what they were in for in my math and physics
   classes. They were happy with the results. End of story.
   I retired after 35 years because I had maxed out my retirement. I was
   not bitter or burned out. I left a school with enough veterans and a
   bunch of good young teachers to keep the ball rolling at a high level
   of achievement. Anyone who points to my school as a "failing" school
   just doesn't know what they are measuring.

   that if this is indeed a factor:

     ... seething resentment that can come from the indignities and
     pitfalls of the profession.

   That perhaps the resentment might be due to the way that teachers are
   systematically disrespected and mistreated? Could it be that resentment
   is, you know, a normal and expected outcome of treating people with
   contempt?

   And that the solution might be, just perhaps, for society to treat
   teachers with a reasonable degree of respect and dignity?

   First: The notion that veteran teachers are better at teaching. I think
   this is a valid point. It makes intuitive sense and there are studies
   supporting it.

   Second: The fact that veteran teachers cost more and (through political
   action) make the entire system cost more. As a parent and taxpayer, I
   don't care about this at all.

   We need to support the hiring of veteran teachers because and only
   because they are better teachers. Trying to use the veteran teacher
   question to sneak in higher benefits for another class of highly-paid
   (yes, teachers are highly-paid) entrenched white-collar workers is the
   sort of thing that loses us credibility.

   Let's keep the focus on how to benefit the kids.

       I briefly investigated the possibility of becoming a high school
       science teacher in Virginia Beach, VA in the early 1980s. One of
       the several reasons I didn't is that I would have had to accept on
       the order of 40% less pay compared to my other opportunities at
       that time with a Chemistry degree.

       I'd be off right now.  As it is, I spent 2 hours this morning
       rereading materials that I need to teach this week and, after a
       break, will spend more hours (re)reading supplementary materials,
       old and new.  Then there's all the grading that I have to do of
       homework that I assigned the end of last week that I need to return
       the beginning of this week.
       Teachers spend a lot of hours outside the classroom and outside
       school on teaching: grading, preparing, learning, thinking,
       mulling, etc.
       When I worked for a corporation, I left work and I had left work.
       So please drop the mythology of teachers' hours being better and of
       teacher pay being so fabu.
       Fun?  Sure?  Rewarding?  Absolutely.  But I don't do it for the

       the demands of teachers' jobs:
       1.) I work 60 hours a week, 6 days a week, all school year. No time
       for a life. I teach over 150 students, and respond to their
       parents' emails and meet with them after school regularly, as well
       as writing plans and grading papers.
       2.) I am not paid in the summer. I have to put money away all year
       to have enough to pay bills in summer. No money for vacation. Most
       teachers get summer jobs because they can't make the money stretch
       all year. Where do you live that teachers have such high pay?
       3.) The state requires continuing education to keep a teaching
       license. This comes out of teachers' pockets or is added to their
       debt. Most states require a Master's degree; have you priced them
       lately?

       So there's points 2, 3, and 4 right there.
       I did teach in rural Montana, so I had nowhere near 150 students.
       The graduating class had less than 20 students, in fact. But I was
       required to attend all home sports events, rotating ticket and
       concession duties, as part of my contract. All school year long.
       As a special bonus, there's not a hell of a lot of summer work in
       rural Montana for a teacher. And teaching isn't even considered a

       I teach in the DC Suburbs.  Our younger and single teachers all
       have second jobs.  Most of them tutor at night and on weekends.
       They also are the first ones to sign up to teach summer school.
       Our "official" school hours are 8:15 to 3:45.  I get to school
       between 7:45 and 8 am and the parking lot is already full.  It's
       also full when I leave at 5, bringing home a bookbag with more work
       in it.
       The problem is that they keep adding things to our plate without
       taking anything away.  This year, I find out that our arts team
       (I'm the music teacher) is expected to post weekly notes for all of
       the grade level teachers and send home a monthly newsletter to our
       700 + students.   That amounts to more work in addition to the new
       curriculum that we are implementing.  I also lost 90 minutes of
       planning time per week due to an increase in enrollment so I have
       more students and less time in which to grade them.  This will mean
       more work at home.  I typically spend Sunday doing school work.
       I'm not complaining.  I'm just saying that this is how it is.  Most
       of us understood that going in.  It just gets really frustrating to
       hear people say--"you only work 9 - 3  nine months a year and get
       all that vacation time" which simply isn't true.
       Back in the 90's our state teachers association did a survey and
       found that the average teacher in our state worked 55 hours a week.
        I'd say that the number of hours have increased.

   The job of a teacher is like being an IT person where you are in
   meetings giving presentations in front of 25 skeptical
   clients/coworkers all day every day from 8-3. At 3pm, you are then free
   to prepare tomorrow's presentations and then do any other work you
   have, and then after that you can do whatever professional development
   you need to do to stay current.

   I've done IT and engineering all my career; I've lived with a teacher
   and seen many other teachers working. Teachers work very hard and quite
   long hours, and while there are long blocks of time to do with as you
   will in summer, it is extremely difficult to get time off during the
   school year.

   Also, as an IT worker, I can go to the bathroom pretty much whenever I
   want (or need). You don't know how valuable that is as a job perk until
   it's gone.

   I worked for corporations (banking) and private companies (Writing,
   Editing, Web Publishing), and now I'm a teacher. During the school
   year, the hours are comparable; I typically work all day Saturday as
   well as Monday-Thursday 2-3 hours after I get home. The school day does
   not provide time for lesson planning, grading, and the relatively
   frequent  professional development requirements. I have about 6 weeks
   in the summer when I am not required to do "in-service training," but I
   also don't receive a paycheck in July and August.

   All in all, at least so far, I'm working about the same number of
   hours, and the pay is lower.

   This may not be true of all teachers, of course.

   I am not insisting that veteran teachers are NECESSARILY better at

   they unpack their boxes, to be sure. I was just arguing that teachers
   don't "degrade" over time the way that the TFA/Charter School crowd
   seems to assume. Furthermore, I do think that there can be great value

       Yes, kids are extremely important. And I want to do the best job I
       possibly can for each of my students, and it is rewarding to feel
       that I've helped young people to prepare for a successful and
       rewarding future.
       That's why I, and most teachers, do tons and tons of "professional
       development" each year, and seek additional training and
       certification.
       And since kids are so important, we should be expected to be
       highly-trained and educated professionals. And we should be paid
       and respected as highly-trained and educated professionals.
       I don't have kids, but I have two well-loved nieces and a nephew. I

   I retired in 2012.  I was recruited out of retirement by a principal
   who knew my work and who valued what I could bring to students and to
   the special program (STEM) from which most of my students come (a few
   of my AP Gov students are not in the STEM program).

   Among other things, my experience gives me a large toolbox from which
   to draw to meet the varied needs of my diverse students.

   I know how to manage a classroom - the key thing is to ensure the
   instruction is geared to the students so they do not get bored nor
   lost.

   I know the importance of connecting with parents, which is why shortly
   I will get back to calling the 45 I have not yet tried (the other 142
   have been called at least once).

   We have these people who have never taught (Bill Gates, Wendy Kopp) who
   bloviate about a field of which they are ignorant.

   With 20+ years of data processing and certification as a systems
   professional and data processor I am far more qualified to judge Mr.
   Gates' output (which by the way often sucks) than he is to judge mine.

   However this is not change.  This is destruction of an honorable
   profession.

   Now education is a business measured by the profits it makes for
   shareholders of publishers and how many graduates are handed diplomas.
    The more diplomas, the better.  Looks good on NCLB.

   Teachers have never been given a fair deal on compensation and I never
   really complained about it.  However with the high cost of getting a
   bachelors and/or master degrees, the very high cost of student loans
   and the negative attitudes by politicians towards civil servants,
   teachers are civil servants, the few remaining rewards are being
   stripped away.

   I retired this year not because I got tired of teaching but because
   with the destruction of teacher retirement by politicians.  I wanted to
   get my retirement before it disappears.

   Now, I recommend that anyone wanting to teach should take a poverty
   oath and join a religious sect.  In the end that person may enjoy the
   few remaining benefits of teaching.

   Curriculum program and I think it seem much better and more creative
   than the 'teaching to the test ' ...No Child Left Behind "which
   punished schools and teachers.

   However teachers who are not very good at being creative seemed to love
   the ' teach to the test', of no child left behind as they did not have
   be creative and form their classes to meet the needs of the different
   ways in which children learn. I think this created a bunch of not so
   great teachers over the years.

   With the New Core Curriculum teams of teachers are in charge of
   figuring out how to teach the Core. The PBS News Hour segment showed
   some very creative teacher's solutions and then interviewed one teacher
   who said she did not like the change, because before they told me how
   to teach the class, now she has to figure out how to teach it. They
   need to get rid of this teacher or she needs some classes and help to
   her.

   Teachers need more respect in this country, but we also need better
   trained teachers & not all teachers show have experience are good
   teachers.

   I am against charter schools, & vouchers. We need to put this money
   into our existing public schools and expect more of teaches, students &
   parents.

       is not at all with how it conceives education nor the standards it
       proposes that students should be held to.  No, the problem is that
       most states are still in the early to middle stages of implementing
       the previous set of standards and frameworks, and now they have to
       throw out all of the work they've done developing their standards
       and training teachers to use them in order to implement the
       entirely new set of standards that have come down from the federal
       department of education.
       The Common Core represents a body of knowledge that teachers are
       expected to train their students to use and understand.  The Core
       is similar to though different from the existing state standards,
       and it does in fact take time and training to get teachers up to
       speed on what those differences are and what expectations will now
       be used to evaluate their performance.  It is a big change, and it
       is the second or third such big change to come down the pike in the
       last twenty years.
       Bad evaluations can lead to firing.  Before you judge that teacher
       too harshly, think for two seconds about the kinds of external
       pressures her school district is subjecting her to.
       Teaching is already a difficult job.  Changing the rules of the
       game every five years makes it indescribably so.

       and now teachers are going to be in the 'interesting' situation
       where the tests will not align with the curriculum they're supposed
       to change over to, not to mention that the kids they have have been
       taught with the old curriculum... and many of them will be judged
       on the result of the tests that have little to do with their
       lessons.
       New tests are supposed to be given on computers starting next
       school year. A substantial percentage of schools, probably a
       majority, will be lacking at least one of:
       1. sufficient bandwidth to administer online tests
       2. sufficient computer terminals/devices to administer online tests
       3. sufficient IT support to set up those computers as required for
       the online tests and to keep them running during the test time.

   this.

   It would be ludicrous to imagine that attacks on teachers and public
   schools are unrelated to broadside attacks on the commons.

   I cringe to think of how -- in the broad and general picture -- the
   intellectual and social development of students who attend schools
   staffed solely by inexperienced teachers will suffer by comparison to
   those who are privileged to learn amid the wealth of all an experienced
   teacher brings to a classroom.

   ...reward veteran teachers?

   I'm asking this question seriously.

   Since veteran teachers are better teachers, their kids will learn more.
   Their kids will score higher on tests.

   Schools that retain veteran teachers will show more progress. Parents
   (at least those who are allowed to have a choice) will flock to schools
   with more veterans.

   The Diarist cited a example of how people view lawyers:

     Hey, forget about David Boies. He's been around too long. I want
     this kid just out of Boalt Law School when I go before the Supreme
     Court. He's been doing this for two years, but he says that he's
     "got this."

   But the key is that you can choose your lawyer....unless you are poor
   and must rely on a Public Defender.

   It is interesting to note that the same poor people who can't choose
   their lawyers are the ones the Entrenched Educational Establishment
   doesn't want to allow to choose their teachers! Rich families have all
   the School Choice they want. They can move between wealthy suburbs and
   enroll in fancy private schools.

   But the poor must take what they are given.

   Why should we not let poor families choose which school they want? This
   will give principals a real reason to retain and reward the Veteran
   Teachers that we all agree are so much better?

     Since veteran teachers are better teachers, their kids will learn

       Learning more and scoring higher on tests are not synonymous.  Then
       there are the content areas which aren't tested and in which

   Are there large numbers of kids who have learned and mastered the
   material, yet fail the tests? I don't think so.

   The anti-testing argument is similar to fable of [1651]The Emperor's
   New Clothes. We ask kids to solve math problems and they cannot. We ask
   them to read and they cannot. We ask them questions about History,
   Geography, and Science, and they cannot answer.

   Yet, we are told by the Entrenched Educational Establishment that this
   is not failure! Instead there are mystical, invisible skills that these
   kids are acquiring -- that our tests can't measure.

   These unmeasurable skills seem to only be visible to those with a
   direct interest in the entrenched status quo.

   Tests are imperfect and it isn't fair to blame teachers for 100% of
   their kids' progress. Most blame belongs with the parents, community,
   and socioeconomic system. But I am highly skeptical of any who say that
   kids are making "progress" when those kids keep flunking tests.

   If kids fail tests, we must assume they didn't learn. The burden of
   proof is on those who would say otherwise.

       that what you so glibly refer to as the "Entrenched Educational
       Establishment" is in large part composed of organized labor,
       teachers unions that have fought hard over the years to get a small
       degree of professional dignity for an exploited and abused
       workforce.
       Back in the day, before unions, teachers were graded on their
       handwriting, on the length of their skirts, on the cleanliness of
       their classrooms.  They were fired for dating, much less getting
       married or pregnant.
       Teachers have won job security and a pay scale based on seniority
       and educational attainment.  They can be, and frequently are, fired
       for cause, but administrators cannot fire a professional status
       teacher on a whim.
       When I worked at a charter school, the principal made up the
       salaries on the fly.  The fact I held a Ph.D. in the subject I
       taught, and that I had thirteen years teaching it at the college
       level, was irrelevant; he simply picked a number out of the air and
       told me that was how much I would get paid.  The benefits at that
       school were a joke -- we used the health plan my wife was offered
       at her private school, because it was cheaper and covered better.
       Ed reform in the US today, while couched in the language of
       improving outcomes for kids, is really about breaking unions.  In
       the real world, teachers unions are at the forefront of searching
       for ways to improve our craft.

       I know that teachers are a powerful ally of progressives.
       I also know that most education "reform" is really a right-wing
       political attack on us.
       But that doesn't mean we don't have serious problems that need
       fixing. And the fact that this Diary is under the "Labor" heading
       highlights part of our problem.
       We are thinking too much about how to protect teachers and not
       enough about how to help kids.
       We need to remember that inner-city and poor rural families are
       also key Democratic voting blocs. These are the people the
       Entrenched Educational Establishment hurts the most. If we don't do
       something to improve schools, our coalition can be split.
       The Koch Brothers are gleefully looking forward to the day when an
       inner-city single mom feels that she must vote for better schools
       or vote for the Democrat. We are playing into their hands by
       ignoring the educational issues and focusing on the salary and
       labor-rights issues.
       Public Education is a Democratic issue. If we don't come up with a
       solution, the electorate will do it for us. The Teacher's Unions
       have been a valued and well-rewarded part of our coalition, but now
       it is time for them to throw us a bone or two. Let us at least have
       reform in the inner city where we need it most!

       the democrats assume they should get our (teachers' votes) because
       they are the lesser of two evils. We've thrown them a bone or two
       or twenty. I've gotten nothing from these people.  Cuomo and his
       death penalty comment? Yeah, he is never getting my vote again.
       I'm an inner-city (NYC) teacher and i will tell you that most
       reform these people have come up with are crap. I teach HS and I
       see what they have done to kids and education.
       Here's reform.  Fire 90% of tweed and shrink class sizes. 5 classes
       of 34 is horrible for all. How about going into kids' homes and
       making sure they are fed, that they sleep, that their parents don't
       hurt them, that they get medical care.  How about making sure there
       are art, dance and music classes so kids can express themselves.
       How about teaching them to think and not fill in a stupid bubble.
       I've taught through Bloomberg and every year the kids get weaker
       and lazier (and their parents are just as bad). Get off the
       phone/laptop/etc and talk to your kid. Read to your kid. Play with
       your kid. (I don't mean you, but all parents.)
       You regularly bash REAL public school teachers and I don't think
       you really like public education. I believe your kid goes to a
       charter school (you have stated that in the past). I wouldn't put
       my cat into a NYC charter school. good luck with that.

       ...you are "killing the messenger".
       High-income kids score higher on tests because high-income kids
       actually know more.
       Rich kids have educated parents to help them with homework. Often
       they have two educated parents! They get enriching experiences over
       the summer. And they can afford to live in better school districts
       (that hire more "veteran" teachers).

   Back in the late 90's, our district addressed the disparity between
   rich and poor schools.  I teach in the DC suburbs in the largest
   district in MD--200 schools.  We have some extremely wealthy areas in
   our county--multimillion dollar homes.  Then we have areas like the one
   I teach in:  95% very diverse minority, 70% poverty rate and largely
   non English speaking.  Schools like mine have smaller class sizes and
   more resources than those in wealthy areas.  Back in the 90's it was
   determined that getting kids on grade level when they were young would
   benefit them, so all day kindergarten was put in place and class size
   caps of 15 for grades K - 2.  Extra reading and math support teachers,
   special ed. resource and ESOL teachers were added.  Free summer
   programs were also added.  The effort paid off.

   The problem is when an entire district is poor and there simply are no
   resources.  I often wonder why some states don't move to larger school
   districts to help spread the resources to those who need them.

       large enough to get high income neighborhoods. There are some very
       large districts in California that are 80%+ free and reduced lunch
       (FRL). This is the reality, in a world where more than half the
       kids in the nation qualify for FRL and a quarter live below the
       poverty line.
       But there's also no reason schools have to be funded solely by
       local property taxes, and I would argue that it's terrible practice
       to do so.
       In California, very wealthy areas are funded almost only by
       property taxes. Those are perversely called "Basic Aid" districts
       because they only get a tiny amount from the state. However, all
       districts are entitled to a floor amount of funding per student,
       and the state pays the difference between property tax receipts and
       that amount on a per daily attendance basis.
       To give you a sense of how important that is, for our school, the
       property taxes only raise $800,000, but the budget is nearly $3
       million.
       It's also the case that a student's ADA money follows them - so
       there's no financial problem for a student to come in to our
       district if we have space.
       California is about to try a big experiment, called the Local
       Control Funding Formula, basically wrapping all the state money
       into a per student number, giving disadvantaged students a bonus,
       and then sending that to districts without so many restrictions on
       how the money can be spent. It will be interesting to see how this
       works out.
       (My biggest concern with LCFF is whether the base grant is high
       enough to meet the needs of non-disadvantaged students.)

       The funding formula per student from the state is weighted

       very large and has some very wealthy areas.  Unfortunately it has
       rather large areas of high poverty so the state compensates us for
       that.

     Are there large numbers of kids who have learned and mastered the
     material, yet fail the tests? I don't think so.

   I'm in my tenth year of teaching.  Last spring I sat in the computer
   lab and watched as my students took the high-stakes state test in math.
    The test should have taken 60-90 minutes to complete.  I had ten
   students "finished" in under ten minutes.  The quickest one was
   completely done in just over 4 minutes.  You can't tell me that those
   were valid test scores.

   These standardized tests mean nothing to many students.  They know that
   the scores have little impact on their own lives.  I have had students
   say "I'm gonna flunk this test and f*** over the school", and "I'm
   gonna flunk this test so you get fired".

   I'm a special education teacher.  I teach kids with severe behavioral
   and/or emotional disorders.  Most of my kids are very intelligent, and
   have mastered the content and skills required.  They show me their

     I'm a special education teacher.  I teach kids with severe
     behavioral and/or emotional disorders.  Most of my kids are very
     intelligent, and have mastered the content and skills required.
     They show me their mastery every day in our classroom.  They don't
     show those skills on standardized state tests.
       So, how does anyone know if you're actually doing your job or not?
       If your students can't pass a test administered by a third party,
       in what way are they learning anything?
       If I am skeptical about whether your students are learning
       anything, what data can you provide to satisfy it? "Trust me"

   as a young elementary student by a 'third party' (the reading

   classroom or for me because her distrust and shyness of a new person
   kept her from reading clearly and confidently.

   My daughter wasn't special ed - in fact she was top of her class. But
   for many kids with disabilities, this kind of performance anxiety is a
   very significant part of their neurology. Autistic kids are classically
   unable to cope well with changes in their routine, for example.

   On the other hand, you can evaluate the teacher and student for
   progress by quietly observing them together, as a good
   supervisor/administrator in charge of this situation will do, and learn
   quite a bit about whether there is quality learning occurring.

       My students learn the content I put before them.  The fact that

       It's clear that you have never worked with emotionally and

       relationship of caring and trust.  But once you have it, you've got
       it forever.
       In their minds, they have no need to demonstrate what they've

 I teach music. I assess my students ([1982]2+ / 0-)

   mainly on performance based tests--individual performances--whether
   they be singing skills, reading notation and playing it on an
   instrument etc.  There are a few skills done on paper, but the majority
   are not.  A written standardized test in elementary music will mean
   that I can no longer emphasize the making of music.  Students will be
   learning about music and not becoming active musicians.  The simple
   fact is that standardized tests must be easy and quick to administer
   and grade which the authentic assessments that I give are not.

   Another issue with state standardized testing for content area like
   mine is that there is little consistency from district to district.  My
   students have music once a week for 45 - 50 minutes.  The students in
   the district where I live, however, have music 2 - 3 times a week for
   90 minutes a week.  It would be ludicrous for students in both
   districts to take the same test.

   My district refused Race to the Top money so our evaluations will
   measure student achievement differently than those who would base an
   evaluation on test scores.

       I teach general music to every student in the school.  Some

       persist with them. I evaluate them in one way or another every time
       I see them as I use the information I glean to drive my
       instruction.  This is why pacing guides are so bad.  Some students
       need to move at a different pace through different parts of the
       curriculum.
       As far as videotaping students performing goes--there would be no
       way for the third party to assess any value added.  I have some
       kids that start out completely tone deaf.  By the end of the school
       year, they are able to sing a limited range of pitches in tune and
       match pitch.  This is a huge improvement.  To record them singing,
       however would not show the improvement.  I won't even go into the
       anxiety some kids experience at the thought of being recorded.
       Many of them don't perform well under those circumstances.

       You can build out a test instrument using multiple choice.  The

       develop.  90% of your time is spent building good distractors.

     Though the Times only showed the data from the 2009-2010 school
     year, there were actually three files released, 2009-2010,
     2008-2009, and 2007-2008.  So what I did was `merge' the 2010 and
     2009 files.  Of the 18,000 teachers in the 2009-2010 data I found
     that about 13,000 of them also had ratings from 2008-2009.

     Looking over the data, I found that 50% of the teachers had a 21
     point `swing' one way or the other.  There were even teachers who
     had gone up or down as much as 80 points.  The average change was 25
     points.  I also noticed that 49% of the teachers got lower
     value-added in 2010 than they did in 2009, contrary to my experience
     that most teachers improve from year to year.

   They're not the same assertions.

   I would add the caveat that the answers vary quite a bit by state. In

 merit pay is stupid ([2050]1+ / 0-)

   just pay me a fair wage and treat me well.

   I have 20+ years and my students do very well on the state tests and I
   still hate merit pay.

   And, the tests are changing and i have no idea what it's going to be
   like.

   I get late transfers `because i'm good' and these kids are usually weak
   kids with loud parents that forced a move.  Last year I got 5 new kids
   into my class half way through the year. They all failed with their
   previous teachers (but it wasn't the students' fault-at least that's
   what the kids and parents said). One.  I will say it again. ONE kid, of
   the 5 passed my class.  The others all failed with grades below 30.
   Some cut daily (like they had in the past). So, because I got these
   kids my passing rate in class and on state tests went down so I would
   not get merit pay. (My only two failures on the state tests were these
   kids and I'm thankful the other two cut the state tests.) The teachers
   they left would get merit pay because they lost their weak links.

   Is that fair? No.

   Just pay me a salary and how about a raise (no pay increases in 5
   years).

       My tenants evaluate me every year.
       Those that approve, renew their leases. Those that don't...leave.
       I usually hire young, low-paid, inexperienced people for repair and
       renovation. For difficult jobs I hire expensive, seasoned pros.
       When you come to rent from me, you will be testing me. If I don't
       pass your test, I won't get paid.
       My rich tenants in good areas get better housing. I use expensive
       pros on their units because they pay more and can demand more. My
       poor tenants can't afford to pay as much, so they get lower-quality
       units worked on by less-skilled workers, or done by me personally.
       The one exception is Section 8. My Section 8 tenants have a VOUCHER
       (OMG! He said the "V" word!) that pays very well. The Section 8
       Program also enforces high quality standards that are above local
       code. These tenants get better housing...despite being
       poor...because they have a large VOUCHER that enables them to
       afford it.
       The trick in education is to make the voucher large. Conservatives
       will resist this, but we must insist on it.

 You are giving students a subsidy ([2103]0+ / 0-)
       to attend a private school.  Many of the big networks of charter
       schools are for-profit institutions, and even those that are
       non-profit still compete with public schools for those tax dollars.
       Public education in the United States has a long history, dating
       well before the Civil War.  Its ethos is to provide free quality
       education to every student who walks in the door, financed through
       modest taxes on the entire community.  It is eminently social from
       top to bottom.
       Private education selects its students (in charters, they do this
       through a lottery, but many voucher schools simply choose among
       applicants), and the tuition charged to those individuals goes to
       profit the teachers and owners of the institution.  It is eminently
       a private activity.
       Me, I believe in government.  That is, I believe government acting
       on its own can be a positive force for social good.  I see no need
       to charge property taxes to the elderly and the childless and pass
       that money on to private companies, the owners of which might very
       well use their profits to purchase themselves yachts and vacation
       homes in the Caribbean.
       The public sector may not always deliver on its promise of quality
       education for all, but it tries.  Private schools, especially
       for-profit private schools, promise investors a return.  Education
       be damned.

       Without food stamps, the recipients might not eat at all.  Without
       vouchers, the recipients would still be able to send their kids to
       school.
       That being said--I understand that there is often a huge gap in the
       quality of the public schools in poor and wealthy neighborhoods.  I
       would much rather see government resources go toward equalizing
       that.  They need to put more resources into the poor schools.  That

       As it should be.  As a teacher, you want me to be evaluated by the

       I believe that teacher evaluations should involve a variety of
       measures.  Student achievement should be a piece of it.  Student
       achievement should encompass a variety of things including
       projects.  This is more labor intensive on the part of those
       conducting the evaluations, but it would give a more accurate
       picture of the teacher's performance.
       Another thing to look at--what does the teacher do when kids are
       not learning to the teacher's satisfaction?  That is a huge part of
       being a successful teacher.  An effective administrator looks at
       that.
       I think much of improving teaching would start with improving
       administration.  Principals are supposed to be instructional
       leaders.  Business types might be good for managing budgets, but it
       takes a real educator to properly evaluate a teacher's performance
       in the classroom during an observation.

       Yeah, this is all great, I'm sure, but the only thing that matters
       is the output of the teaching process, and that is something that
       it does not take a teacher to evaluate.
       An educator may be able to give another educator advice as to the
       process of the education, but your customers don't give a shit
       about the process at all. I literally don't care if teachers adhere
       or don't adhere to some pedagogy model or other, or if a principal
       likes or dislikes their classroom management, or whatever. I care
       only that the student knows math or science or writing or whatever
       at the end of the class.
       All the things you mention are part of the process. I don't care
       about the process. I care about the output. Without standardized
       testing, how do I know if the final output of the education process

 You have to test whether ([2188]0+ / 0-)

       I never claimed to produce physicists. I claimed to have exposed

       had some elementary math they could use to explore further what
       they had learned about. I teased them with enough calculus so they
       could talk about physics at a more advanced level.
       I consider it a happy byproduct that I have taught many students

 Making the voucher large is all very well, but ([2210]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [2211]Mostel26, [2212]Naniboujou, [2213]Caniac41

   explain to me, how, exactly, this will happen politically.

   The political dynamic behind almost every voucher scheme I've seen is
   either a) saving money in general or b) spending less on public
   education.  The motivation behind vouchers overwhelmingly isn't reform,
   it's to spend less.  In other words, make the voucher small.  At the
   very least, smaller than what we're now spending in general education
   levy/state aid/other per student.  Quality control doesn't enter into
   the picture except for lip service.  And so, vouchers end up being
   tagged as morally defective because they're a vehicle for morally
   defective behavior.

   Unless you can strip that motivation out, vouchers will simply
   undermine a service like K-12 education.  And, in the one part of the
   educational sector where voucher-style finance has been even minimally
   successful, higher education, providers have returned the favor with
   runaway costs.

   But nobody seems to have the balls or the competence to actually try to
   reform existing institutions.  One example is size; moderate school
   districts do way better than small ones that can't provide the
   necessary range of services or large ones that are topheavy and
   unresponsive to change.  You know, like consolidate rural districts
   that are too small, or divide big city school districts that are too
   big.  It's difficult, because it involves challenging politicians and
   administrators who want to keep things they way they are.  But guess
   what, it actually does something for the people who count, the kids,
   and the teachers who teach them.  And yet we tiptoe around the edges of
   rural consolidation and completely avoid big city division.

   In the end, the political formula for success in the biggest variety of
   situations is broadening the stakeholder base and making a community
   service out of things.  You know, like a typical well-run moderate-size
   K-12 school district that's treated as a community asset, not just a
   glorified day-care center.

 It can happen... ([2217]0+ / 0-)
       ...if we sell the Teachers' Unions on it.
       We make a deal:

     -- We agree to pump serious funding increases into the system in the
     form of Charters/Vouchers/Merit-Pay. The total cash pie gets bigger.

      -- In return, the Unions must agree to allow more of (not all) the
     pie to be sliced based on performance/tests/parental-school-choice.
       That is the basic idea. There will need to be much haggling over
       particulars.
       Remember, Charters are not necessarily anti-union. Here in NYC, the
       UFT actually runs some Charter Schools. Who is better qualified to
       design a school than a group of pro teachers? What parent, given
       the choice, would not pick a teacher-run Charter over a
       Corporate-run one?
       But right now the Right-Wing is controlling the reform narrative.
       They are changing how the pie is sliced without making it bigger.
       And they are successful because inner-city families (like mine) who
       are Natural Democrats are willing to sell out the Unions if it
       helps our kids.
       We will do anything if it helps our kids. Anything.

       Not that it matters. The goal of conservatives, for which you
       advocate so ably, is privatization. That is, they/you seek to
       profit from education. Vouchers will allow them/you to use the
       government's power of taxation to collect money from the citizenry
       and hand it over to "education" companies. Education "reform" has
       nothing to to with "empowering" anyone. It is about handing public
       education, and its considerable revenue stream, over to the private
       sector. Again, it doesn't matter whether you really don't get it or
       are deliberately muddying the waters, you serve the privatizers.

       you would know that periods go inside quotation marks.  :)
       But, more seriously, since you're the one who made this initial
       claim:

     Since veteran teachers are better teachers, their kids will learn
     more. Their kids will score higher on tests.
       the burden of proof is on you.  And let's be clear here.  I'm
       talking about the obsession with high-stakes testing.  I'm hoping
       that we can all agree that students need to be assessed and
       evaluated.
       If you're simply referring to teachers giving their students
       high-stakes assignments that make sense within the context of the
       classroom and curriculum that the teacher has designed, then I
       would agree with you, especially as those high-stakes assignments
       can be papers and presentations; they don't need to be tests.
       But if you're talking solely about the types of district-wide high
       stakes testing that's now going on constantly thanks to NCLB, and
       you're saying that students' scores on those tests reflect what
       they have learned, I say: prove it.

     more thoughtful and comprehensive ways of thinking about

       Study leaders never concluded that merit pay was a "failed idea."
       As you quoted, the researcher said it was "no magic bullet" on its
       own.
       Of note, only standardized test scores were used for the evaluation
       of effectiveness.  Would you agree that a measure of teaching
       effectiveness based on scores alone is sufficient to call it a
       failure?
       It also only measured performance over a limited time period.  I
       would think that merit pay would tend to weed out less effective
       teachers, but it might take more than a year or two.

   ...that there are "lazy" teachers who aren't trying. That's all it

     "...math teachers in grades 5 through 8 were offered bonuses of

     targets....researchers found no significant difference between the
     test results from classes led by teachers eligible for bonuses and
     those led by teachers who were ineligible."

   So this means that the non-bonused teachers were not (as right-wingers
   claim) slacking.

   But if veteran teacher are better, they will be more likely to make the
   bonus. Even if a young teacher tries very hard, they will not be as
   effective as a veteran. The difference is that now the veteran will
   actually get paid for being better.

   with an assumption that you'd pay a small number of teachers a small
   amount of money.

   No one considers that maybe every teacher, or maybe 90% of teachers in
   a particular school might be stars.

   If you have a teacher not worthy of merit pay, you probably should be
   working on removing that teacher.

   The reality is that merit pay in what is a cooperative team environment
   creates friction and tension, not excellence. Your 3rd grade teacher
   can't be excellent if your 2nd grade teacher isn't doing her job well.

   I'll also note that I've not seen anyone advocate for 'merit pay' for
   firefighters, police officers, governors, or mayors, just as an
   example.

   What teachers need aren't bonuses as much as they need to be paid
   enough to buy a house near in the community, to meet typical needs, and
   to send their kids to college.

   These students make progress during the year given a creative,

   again shocked at the quality of education that kids now get. Both of my

   Both teachers are known for being "good teachers" and because we can
   pick which teacher teaches our kids their classes are more full than
   the not as good teachers.

   Teaching is actually a very well paid job around here. Not in
   comparison to engineers or other professionals but in comparison to
   most people who actually aren't professionals. Good money but well
   earned is my take on it.

   But here's the flip side. That teacher who used to berate kids in front
   of their classmates, the one who took pleasure in embarrassing and ran
   her class like the kids were in the army, the one who would ostracize
   any kid she was angry at that day, the mean one, she is still there,
   even though she could retire. She's the one we need reform for.
   Teachers used to hit kids a lot here. Can't do that any more,
   physically or mentally.

   I like the testing too. The school (public) places very highly on
   standardized tests, despite high levels of free lunch, kids get a few
   hours of Chinese every week too.

       (When evaluations are subjective, instead of based on standardized

       The problem is that most Principals in poor neighborhoods have no
       incentive to remove bad teachers. The families are locked into the
       school, they cannot afford to flee to the suburbs and they have
       little or no political power. The families have no choice and they

       in poor neighborhoods may not have an incentive to remove bad
       teachers is because they don't think they can get better
       applicants.
       That's a real problem. Some really terrible schools are not nice
       places to be, not for kids, not for adults either. A school with
       high turnover is IME a red flag that there may be a problem there,
       with the facilities, with the administration, or with the
       community.
       If a principal is really inflicting terrible teachers on students
       because he doesn't care, he needs to be removed. Simple as that.
       All schools need to be clean. All schools need to be safe. And
       teachers like to work with kids and families who are excited about
       learning. Teachers like to work with principals that solve their
       problems and that value them as professionals.
       Schools in really poor neighborhoods need a lot more resources to
       do what schools in wealthier communities take for granted. They
       probably need smaller student to staff ratios. They probably need
       more money for facilities and field trips. We don't fund low income
       schools to the same level that high income areas are funded,
       especially not when you consider fundraising by PTAs and the value
       of volunteer time. Our school funding mechanisms aren't equitable,
       not at all.

 two things ([2462]5+ / 0-)

   There are two things going on here.  First over the past 50 years or so
   we have gotten very good at educating everyone, and opening up
   opportunity for everyone.  For example, Instead of 15 students in
   calculus at a few selects schools, we have 40 or more students in
   calculus at every school.  In Houston, for example, arguable the best
   most competitive school in the city is 10% white, 30% Hispanic, 25%
   African american and 40% Asian, with 50% on free or reduced lunch(under
   represent white, over represent asian).  That is diversity, that is
   educating the population of Houston no matter who they are.

   And it scares the crap out of so many people because it means that if
   you are not competitive, if you are just looking for your kid to get
   the education that you got just because you were entitled, it is not
   going to happen.  So we have charter schools opening up everywhere
   diverting money from those who want an education from those who are
   willing to work for it.  Years ago I had an argument with a coworker
   over education in they city.  She claimed that her kids could not get a
   good education. Finally she admitted that they were not willing to work
   in primary school, so they could not test into a good school, so she
   moved to the suburbs where the competition was not so great.

   Second is teachers. I am not going to say anything about TFA teachers
   They are dedicated to the students and work hard, and most have content
   knowledge though some do not.  However, content knowledge is not
   everything.  I know older teachers who are not so great at content
   knowledge but are expert at getting students to learn and integrate
   knowledge.  This is really the only skill that matters.  Student
   learning.  And not just learning what is in the curriculum, but
   learning how to live and how to get along.  And if the only people you
   have teaching are those who made 4.0 averages from the top schools,
   where is the diversity in that?  school is not about getting a 4.0, it
   is about learning, and experiencing, and sometimes failing.  TFA picks
   to form a  very homogeneous corp, where everyone has the same
   perspective on what it means to succeed.  It is an echo chamber that
   lacks alternative voices

   And this is what is common between the new teachers and new schools
   that are the new reform.  Consistency that is controlled from top.
   Where once a teacher could teach what the teacher loved, in a way that
   would enliven it to the students, now a teacher covers what is on the
   test, in a way that is consistent with what outside evaluators consider
   good practices.  This is nothing more than a paycheck and paying off
   student debts.  There is nothing for the students in reform.

   New principal two years ago.  The first thing she did was to attack and
   try to fire the second-most senior staff member - a much-loved middle
   school science teacher.  The teacher brought her union in and fought
   hard.  The administration was forced to back down.

   The principal now has her sights on the most senior staff member.  He
   is a senior high math teacher and is my son's home room teacher.  We
   love him.

   The whole thing has created a huge rift in the staff, with the younger
   members siding with the principal and the senior members questioning
   all of the huge top-down changes that are being forced on the
   community.

   It's awful.  This is a school where the staff has been so cohesive and
    - just wonderful.  The angst and animosity is heartbreaking, not just
   among the staff, but within the parent and student community, as well.
    We had a community meeting last week with a facilitator so that people
   wouldn't start yelling at each other.

       Yes, we are way down that path.  There was a district rep at the
       meeting who has been specifically assigned to this issue, as well
       as representatives from the school board.
       One problematic area is that it appears that the district and the
       administration are taking what was a highly successful alternative
       school with non-traditional curriculum and rapidly turning it into
       a cookie-cutter education factory with no input from the school
       community.  This school has always been a highly collaborative,
       democratic community, with all stakeholders, including students,
       being given equal voice.  That is now almost completely gone.
       The issue is also made more volatile by race.  The new principal is
       African American and every question, every challenge is met with
       accusations of racism.
       At the meeting the other night, one of the "rules of engagement"
       for the meeting and its aftermath was that there would be no
       retaliation for what was said at the meeting.  Can you imagine how
       bad it is when parents feel they have to insert a "No retaliation"
       clause?  Many parents wept as they talked.  One teacher broke down
       and had to stop speaking.
       Anyway, sorry to ramble on, and thanks for your encouragement.  We
       will continue to push toward some sort of compromise.

   "Calcification and resentment" among senior teachers, the first
   question we should be asking ourselves is why we would administer our
   schools so poorly that our employees apparently hate their jobs.

   I am lucky to see amazing, enthusiastic, capable teachers with a range
   of experience. My sense is that the best arrangement for a school is to
   have a mix of expert veterans and younger teachers. Everyone learns
   from everyone in this scenario: the younger teachers are mentored by
   the older; the older teachers are introduced to ideas that come from
   meeting and working with the new teachers. A great teacher is always
   learning from one's students, both the younger and the adult students.

   The older teachers create stability in the school and the community;
   they know the kids and the families; they know what activities and
   resources are around. They have institutional memory of what has worked
   and what has not.

   Turnover itself creates stress and some chaos. IME, any school that is
   having a lot of turnover is an indication of a problem in that school.
   If your staff isn't happy to be there and doesn't want to stay, what is
   wrong there? And what can we do to make it a school where everyone
   wishes to teach there forever?

   Recommended by:
          [2593]Sparhawk, [2594]antirove, [2595]ManhattanMan

   age is an important consideration..

   Take

   "MDs" as an example. Given no personal experience with an MD one of my
   considerations is age.

   I want an MD who has had some time to develop their skills but I also
   want someone who is fresh enough that they are up to date on the latest
   science.

   As such I pick middle aged (by MD standards) because they have the best
   combination of these two.

   For engineers this is also true.

   Once anyone gets over this hump of peak performance people should
   consider moving to support roles.

   In support roles individuals can provide very valuable insights which
   come from their experience, however lack of understanding of the exact
   nature of current "best practices" is less of an issue.

   Also you blatantly miss represent one of the articles you posted

     Teachers improve in effectiveness at least over
     their first few years on the job. Characteristics
     such as board certification, and content
     knowledge in math sometimes are linked
     with student achievement. Still, these factors
     don't explain much of the differences in
     teacher effectiveness overall.

   This does not state that teachers improve continuously with experience

   From your own quote
   "A national researcher once [argued] that the most effective year for
   teaching is around year 7, . "

   So in short, there are peaks in MANY MANY MANY professions, there is no
   magic reasons to suspect that teachers are magically different.

   just like in any other profession.

   It's important to remind folks that progressive reformers are asking
   for the following:

   1) Give school site teams the ability to to hire the best licensed
   teachers for their students, regardless of seniority. Sometimes the
   best teachers are seasoned veterans. Sometimes they're newer to the
   profession. Let site teams make this decision.

   2) Get site teams the ability to get rid of ineffective teachers. In
   Minnesota, a recent study asked teachers what percentage of their
   colleagues in their building shouldn't be in the classroom. The answer
   was between  15-18 percent.  In my particular district, less than one
   percent of tenured teachers are ever fired for poor teaching. This is
   nuts.

   You can talk all about evil corporate privatizers....it's a great way
   of changing the subject from the actual policies being proposed. Heck,
   if I was trying defend the status quo, I'd change the subject too.

   Because if the status quo was working, none of this would matter. Keep
   seniority. Let teachers keep their jobs for life regardless of
   performance. But in Minneapolis, less than 50 percent of our children
   of color are doing math and reading at grade level; less than 40
   percent graduate from high school on-time.

   Yes, poverty plays a role. Yes, we need to support income equality,
   better health-care, etc. But it's not  an either-or choice. We must do
   these things AND start design our schools around the success of our
   actual students as opposed to the comfort and convenience of adults.

   Because if less than 50 percent of white kids were reading at grade
   level, if less than 40 percent were graduating on time, we would have
   already changed our schools to work better for these kids. We would
   have changed the staff, the school day, school year, curriculum,
   whatever if took because it white kids were failing, it would be a
   big-time crisis.

       prevent this type of harassment.  It seems like every year at our

       baby in August and had to take the first few months of school off.

   But is that the question you really wanted to ask? Does it matter to
   you if they were fired or if they resigned or if they were removed in
   some other way? The fact is that very few teachers are formally fired,
   yes. But it's also true that teaching has a very high attrition rate,
   of people who leave "voluntarily." Some of those people realize they're
   not doing a good job; some of them get better offers from elsewhere;
   some are just tired; some are pushed out.

   It happens to be more convenient for everyone for a letter of
   resignation to appear, and so that's usually how it goes.

   and we will always want them to be better. Let's just stipulate that up
   front.

   We are not doing well enough by our low income and minority kids.
   Totally true. That said, we are also doing better by them than we ever
   have. There is no "Golden Age" when it was better to be a youngster of
   color in the American education than it is today.

   Your "poverty plays a role" though I think is dismissive. ~25% of
   American kids live in poverty. That's a shamefully low standard for any
   child, let alone a quarter of our kids. Most of these kids are damaged
   by that experience - they lack a safe, quiet place to be; they lack
   security for themselves or their possessions; they lack adequate
   medical and dental care. Poverty is neurologically damaging and some of
   these kids have PTSD. Giving them two math classes a day and demanding
   they study harder is probably not a solution.

   Attendance plays a role. Many low income kids, for whatever reason,
   also have very poor attendance. The teachers can't teach the kids who
   don't come to school.

   A lot of these kids are already behind when they show up for
   Kindergarten. These kids and families need more support from programs
   like Head Start and state preschool programs, not less.

   Peers are important. Being surrounded by peers who are high achieving
   and expected to be high achieving is probably more important than the
   teachers you have. When we have districts that are 80%+ free and
   reduced lunch, you're not going to be able to make classrooms with this
   advantage. And so, you need more resources to build this culture for
   these kids. In most places in the US, low income districts and schools
   like this also have less money to spend, and fewer volunteers to work
   with kids.

   financial success (Or in many cases, putative financial success) with
   being smart/good at anything/productive.  It logically follows that if
   you take people who have money, or have a degree in a field that will
   allow them to have money in the future, then it's a good idea to have
   them take the place of qualified teachers, since teachers on make
   teachers salaries, which are painfully low.  Now that you have someone
   giving up a potentially higher salary, surely you'll see benefits in
   the classroom?

   The problem, of course, is equating [putative] financial success with
   being good at anything besides making money, and presumably whatever
   career they are/would make money in.

   Place I work has a "Citizen School" initiative - fortunately, our part
   of the program seems aimed at tutoring / mentoring (Which I'm all in
   favor of - 1-on-1 tutoring by non-professionals seems reasonable to
   me), rather than replacing teachers, but the logic behind this

   Great diary.  There are several aspects that technology adds to this
   dynamic:

   1. This is the further McDonadlization of education, in this case
   highlighting the acceptability of turnover, as the job becomes
   "McDonadlized" through standardization and quantification.

   2.  Technology will give us the next step--turning teachers into
   facilitators in a "student-centric" environment, but where the students
   "explore content" that is provided on-line or through computerized
   educational models developed by the textbook companies.  Teachers no
   longer "teach" in the "flipped classroom" but merely assist students to
   enhance their learning experience.  In this model (already showing up
   in charter schools), young facilitators--paid less than teachers,
   naturally--are required to be "people persons" with good computer and
   internet skills.  No content knowledge required.

   3.  Finally the technology gap between the older and younger teachers
   makes itself manifest in performance ratings.  In my own school,
   several sections of the performance review are based on the integration
   of technology in the classroom, so that students can ?master 21st
   century skills".  Never mind that the class observed was an actual
   discussion about ethics and morals.  In the administrator's mind, some
   part of the daily classroom experience must involve students staring at
   screens, regardless of the effectiveness of that method....

 I heard a teacher talking about ([2795]0+ / 0-)

   her "flipped classroom" this summer.  She actually plans to have kids
   watch how-to videos as homework the night before,  then have them
   "practice" in the classroom! My mouth fell open when she explained that
   she would be "teaching" math this way. She thinks she's being modern
   and making use of technology. Sad.

 This is IMHO a really promising idea ([2799]0+ / 0-)
       the idea of making the videos the homework and then bringing the
       homework into the classroom. The advantage is that you've gotten
       the concept of the material out there, and then you can spend class
       time on the difficult areas and on working with the kids on the
       problems, instead of on lecturing.
       You can get your best lecture recorded, and you can integrate it
       with other video or animated materials, if you're really awesome.
       Kids who are out sick can still get the lecture.
       It means that you don't need to have expert parents at home to help
       you with homework, too.
       However, this only works if you can count on all the kids to watch
       the videos. Can you? I don't know.
       And of course, there's the matter of the technology. If the video
       requires an internet connection, not everyone has one. Can you
       count on kids being able to take tablets home and be able to keep
       them safe? Can you count on them being able to sit and watch/listen
       in an uninterrupted spot for the requisite time?
       As an educational idea, I really like it. As a practical idea, I
       know that right now it will not work in our district.

 I wish I agreed ([2803]0+ / 0-)
       I respect your point of view, but replacing the interaction and
       dynamic, multi-layered discussion that takes place in the classroom
       with a how-to video is like replacing Thanksgiving with a TV
       dinner.  As a math teacher, I see it as a poor idea. I do, however,
       appreciate having Khan Academy videos available as a back-up
       resource for students who have been absent.

 Well, I see it the other way ([2807]0+ / 0-)
       You get the basic out there, you get everyone's minds primed with
       the ideas for the lesson, and then you can jump right into
       discussion and practice. It should yield more time for the human to
       human interaction, with more student classroom time being active
       participation instead of passive listening.
       That's the theory.
       I think as a practical matter, though, this falls into dust if the
       kids don't do the video homework, and in most places the logistics
       of life are not necessarily making this possible. Our community
       does not generally have internet. Lots of kids do their homework
       now on the bus, or at the sidelines at practice, or in a car. All
       these things are real problems in terms of deploying it this year.
       I would love to hear what your friend's experiences are of it in
       practice.

 I can tell you what my classroom is like ([2811]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [2812]elfling

       Teaching and learning is a complex, multi-layered experience.  I
       teach using something between magician and Socrates- I pose
       questions, challenge assumptions, have kids come up front and
       explain their strategies.  To hand all of that excitement over to a
       flat, static video, where the student is a passive observer, is to
       turn my back on all that I've learned that education can be.  Think
       of all of the varying levels of students' abilities, learning
       styles, intelligences- how much better a real, live experience can
       be than a video.
       Going this route is to relegate teaching to technicians.  Sit down,
       children, and watch this.
       Saying that having them watch a video primes them so that they can
       follow up in class- well, that would be, for me, like telling them
       all about how the rabbit was pulled out of the hat first, then
       having them come in to watch the show.  Borrring! Depresses me to
       think of giving up the excitement for that!
       In my class, students learn to have fun and ponder the infinite
       with math.  Not just to master technical skills.

       But I guess what I'm looking at is the other side of the coin,
       watching my daughter and her father spend an hour or so on a
       homework set, with him spending a lot of time actively tutoring her
       in the work. She gets home, she starts to work the problems, and
       elements that seemed obvious to her in class are suddenly not,
       especially not when she is tired and cranky.
       My husband and I are both proficient in math well beyond calculus.
       Assisting her with algebra is well within our skillset.
       However, I believe we are the only family in her class where this
       is so. It will only get worse as the kids get older.
       I worry about the other kids who go home and have to struggle
       through homework alone.
       Our school does try to go above and beyond, providing a 7th period
       that can be used for homework, and providing an academic assistance
       time three days a week after school.
       I am glad what you are doing is working for your kids, and I love

       I'll drop in the unsolicited and off topic suggestion of an SF
       series that also loves math and mathematicians, the Liaden Universe
       by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller.
       One of the books is currently free as an eBook:
       [2824]Fledgling
       We meet Theo as a teenager, a bit clumsy, but good at her studies.
       She uses lacemaking to work out problems in math. She lives in a
       high surveillance world, and we see her first trying to make her
       way as a student when every misstep is watched by the
       authorities...
       If you read the whole thing, you'll find out that the series is
       named for a character who was the premier mathematician of his day.
       :-) And nearly every hero in the novel series is quite good at
       math, because in this universe, it's a prerequisite for being a
       pilot.

       We need more books about math. Math as an element in a story, not

       Not sure what level you teach, but you probably already know of the

   I was most skilled and effective in these last few years. The value of
   experience is obvious in every other enterprise, so this recent
   sabotage of education should be both inexplicable and ominous to the

   The nature of the work, face to face with millions of students, means
   there are vast numbers of teachers. That's being used as a source of
   profit as you say, but it can also be a source of strength. Keeping the

   Someday the survivors will look back on this period and acknowledge US
   public education was virtually destroyed by misapplication of a faulty
   management strategy: the Six Sigma system developed at Motorola and
   used to devastating effect by Jack Welch at GE. In a nutshell, it
   "ranks and yanks" in order to pare payrolls to the bone.

   Management develops a productivity metric like test scores (the metric
   is often entirely arbitrary, since metrics that can accurately assess
   both volume and quality are very difficult to devise, as Soviet central
   planning found out the hard way); this metric is then applied
   frequently to divide the workforce up into five "productivity"
   quintiles; those in the bottom quintile are then fired. The next time
   the metric is applied those falling into the new bottom quintile are
   usually those who'd fallen into the fourth quintile on the previous
   occasion; they too are fired. Keep doing this year after year until
   almost no one is left, then declare the enterprise to have "failed" and
   sell it off to Bain Capital (or, in the case of public education, turn
   everything  over to the charter schools).

   Jack Welch used this to eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs at GE,
   and he was rewarded for it with one of the highest "golden parachute"
   packages in corporate history.

   Years ago, at my grandmother's funeral in Brooklyn, I was stunned to

   holding each arm, almost like she was floating toward me, like a ghost.
   She looked like she was 120 years old. I couldn't believe it when I saw
   her face for the first time in like 20 years and remembered her like I
   had just walked into 2'nd grade classroom.  She greeted me by name,
   grasped my hand into her two milky white silky soft hands and kissed
   me, and said how much she'd loved my Grandmother. She proceeded to do
   the same to all of my siblings, by name, all of whom also had her for
   2'nd grade.

   I couldn't stop watching her. She moved on to my Aunt  who apparently
   also had this nun for 2'nd grade and she did and said the same things.

   She moved on down the line to my parents and I was astonished to see
   that they'd also had her for 2'nd grade! She said the same things and
   added a remark about how I'd grown up as if to congratulate my parents.

   She went up to the casket and touched my grandmother's hands and prayed
   quietly for a few moments.

   I still wonder to this day if my Grandmother had her for 2'nd grade...

   aftrer 29 years teaching high school social studies in two high schools
   in a county on the outskirts of the Atlanta metro area.  I did my best
   work in my last decade or so on the job.

   Over the years I knew a number of folks who came into the classroom
   with the end goal of getting an administrator's position as soon as
   possible.  Without exception they were bad teachers and they became
   worse administrators.

   The year I retired my school also lost 5-6 other teachers to
   retirement.  We had a combined total of over 200 years of experience.
   All of us left when we did because the administration made it clear
   that we had nothing of value to cotnribute to the running of the
   school.

   In the 3 years since we all left the academic environment at the school
   has  declined and other veteran teachers have left.  But the
   administrators have plenty of young teachers they can boss around so
   they're happy.

   I was the building rep for the Georgia Association of Educators for
   years.  When I left and the veteran who took the GAE position over
   ffrom me transferred a year later there was no one willing to take the
   job, and GAE membership has plummeted there.  (The young teachers are
   mostly brainwashed into thinking the adminstrators always know best and
   it's disloyal to them to think you might need representation.)

   First let me say that any notion that LACK of experience is a good
   thing is completely insane.  Its not something anyone looks for in a
   cook, home builder, doctor, lawyer, photographer, actor or starting
   quarterback.  Why in the world would teachers be different?

   Now let me tell you about some of the attitudes from the teaching
   profession about what constitutes "experience."

   I started teaching as a young Sergeant because in the Army that is what
   young Sergeants do.  A basic function of an NCO is to teach others.
   Initially I was given VERY simple classes with little deviation from
   the Program of Instruction (POI).  Before I could give the class to
   "students" I had to give it multiple times to NCOs senior to me - all
   of whom could give the class in their sleep.  And when I gave the class
   one of them would be in the audience to grade me, correct any mistakes
   and help me get better for the next time.

   As I moved up the experience ladder I progressed to longer, more
   detailed classes and was allowed to deviate from the POI more and more.
    Eventually I was one of the ones sitting in the practice classes
   helping someone more junior prepare for his first class.

   While not exactly Socratic most classes had heavy interaction with the
   "students" because they tended to be hands on at some point.  The Army
   stresses "Be, Know, Do" with its leaders - Be is having been trained in
   the task yourself, Know is knowing the task in depth, Do is doing the
   task successfully and repeatedly.  It is rare that a class in the Army
   is given by someone who isnt an expert in that task.  Preparation is
   stressed beyond what most could imagine.  Every class has "Tasks,
   Conditions and Standards" that must be met.  There are volumes of
   training aids that can, should or must be used for every class.  We do
   rehearsals that would make Steve Jobs proud.

   None of this should be foreign to any teacher.  Anyone who is part of
   the teaching profession should recognize the process and implementation
   of that process.  It is be easy to see that the Army teaches it people
   how to teach.  And you would think that if something was that obvious
   it would be easy to quantify and qualify the level of experience in
   equivalent terms.  You would think.  But in fact that is the exact
   opposite of what happens in the real world.

   Experienced soldiers who have taught thousands of hours of formal
   classes, written thousands of POIs, trained hundreds of others to teach
   are told "you dont have a teaching degree, no job."  Soldiers with
   multiple degrees in other areas in addition to years, even decades of
   actual teaching experience are told that they cant be hired while
   someone with nothing other than a degree in education can.

   For as long as I have had friends departing the military they have
   faced prejudice and obstacles to becoming teachers that few other
   professions do.  Logistics companies value what Army logisticians
   bring.  Intelligence officers have no issue finding people willing to
   pay for their experience.  Yet very few districts make it easy for
   soldiers - most of who REALLY like teaching - to turn their experience
   into a job.

   It is idiotic to think less experience is a good thing.  But the
   teaching profession has said loud and clear that they only value
   experience on their terms.  And that makes them look stupid,
   protectionist and calcified.

   it. Robert E. Lee

   The money issue is one thing, of course. They want teachers on the
   cheap - low pay newbies.

   They want people without the confidence years of experience give,  able
   to resist bad ideas and worse policies.

   They want to deny them the credibility that comes with years on the
   job.

   They want to turn teachers into disposable commodities, instead of
   people in it for the long haul.

   They want to destroy institutional memory - so there will be no  one
   who can say "We tried that and it didn't work."

   It's all part of the corporatization of education. When you hear how we
   must ramp up STEM education, they want to turn schools into assembly
   lines turning out disposable techno-serfs for business. They don't want
   people who understand art, history, music, literature or what it takes
   to fully exercise citizenship. Such people are dangerous, because they
   know that there is more to life than just piling up money or taking
   orders.

   evidence, but there's nothing in the linked article that supports your
   statement about charter schools. The word "charter" does not appear in
   the article, and most of the comparisons, including the public/private
   comparison, are between the early 70s and 2008. Depending on how you
   define the term, charter schools have only been around since the late
   80s/early 90s. If charter school info is reflected at all in the chart
   under "Myth No. 3" it would be in the public school bars for 2008.

   BTW, the comparison between public and private does show better results
   for private schools, although the difference is small.

   What the article does do well is bust the myth:

     ... that America's schools are in a state of terminal decline and
     students aren't learning as much as those of a generation ago.

   Is it possible you meant to cite to a different article re charter
   schools?

   I speak of the Adult Ed Division of the Los Angeles Unified School
   District. After years of incremental cut-backs and downsizing of course
   offerings, the biggest collapse came in 2012. There were hundreds of
   layoffs, mandatory transfers and curriculum changes.

   One criteria to be applied was Longevity - the Adult Ed equivalent of
   Seniority. It came as a shock to many veteran teachers that their
   decades of teaching magically were reset to zero, or maybe 1-2 years.
   Without the benefit of Longevity, many lost their jobs when their
   hourly wage was highest. And, they lost health coverage when
   replacement coverage would be most pricey - if available at all.

   How did this happen? Legally. With union representation too.

   Contract renegotiation in early 2000's (using volunteer negotiators not
   a labor attorney) altered the formula for Longevity to elow the
   existing formula. Subsequently, when hours were reduced or summer
   sessions omitted, lots of teachers got their Longevity reset to zero.
   That meant layoffs. BTW: Tenure processing had been On Hold for years -
   or arbitrarily denied to very qualified older teachers.

   Did teachers know all this when they ratified the contract? I don't
   know, I wasn't there at the time. Typically, only key points of a
   revised 420-page contract are handed out as bullet points on union vote
   day. But I suspect it would have passed.

   Longevity reset (linked to the cost of health benefits) was considered
   minor to avoiding co-pays. And Adult Ed was in expansion mode at the
   time..layoffs seemed remote.

   Side Point: This is yet another major, major selling point for Single
   Payer Healthcare - not linked to employment. But that will be another
   post.

      Most teachers truly do not hit their stride until at least year 4 or
   5.  Veteran teachers are evaluated annually, take credits for
   relicensing, tech training, etc. just as non-vets do.  They may have to
   get to sleep a half hour or hour earlier (as most people over 45 or 50
   do), but that comes out of their personal lives, not their professional
   lives.  Your piece is right on the money as to why veterans are being
   vilified these days.

     It's largely the veterans who are doing the activism work to keep
   public education alive, as the 2-year wonders are only focused on their
   futures.  They generally have no longterm investment in their schools,
   students, students' families, communities, neighborhoods. Our hope is
   to return teaching somewhat to pre-NCLB days, before national ed policy
   began to destroy teaching, true learning, and schools.  The destruction
   of public ed is accelerating rapidly now, thanks to Wall Street-type
   endless greed, and we all know what's that's done to other areas of our
   middle class lives!  I'm not quite ready for 100% virtual-schooling
   from home.

       Your last paragraph, though, says it all.  Thanks.

     As someone who has been in the classroom for 17 years, I can tell
     you that any second-year teacher who really thinks "Okay, I've got
     this" is most likely (a) painfully arrogant and (b) completely
     wrong.

   It took me about five years before I really knew what I was doing. At
   the time, I kept wondering if I was doing something wrong. Looking back
   on it now, I can see that I had somehow stumbled into doing everything
   right.  Some things just take time.

   I do feel, by the way, that one of the main problems in terms of
   getting the public to understand this reality, is that most people do
   not perceive any special, unique, skill in teaching. Sure, there are
   factors like passion, patience, and persistence which are important.
   And organizational skills must also be important. But those are life
   skills important to everybody. So do uniquely professional skills
   related to teaching exist? I think most people would say "let me think
   about that one a while."

   Yet, those are the skills that take 5 or six years to develop, and
   since the process is sink or swim for many (most?) teachers, a standard
   vocabulary to transmit and reflect upon them doesn't really exist.

   I'm starting to ramble. Sorry.

   None of this makes a bit of difference if they don't count your vote.

 I hear that at my R1 AAU public university ([3149]0+ / 0-)

   the Ed. school & department has far fewer students interested in
   majoring (including grad students) than it has in decades.

   Teaching is not a profession young people want to enter into, which
   makes me question this: "We have this highly motivated, highly driven
   work force....' "

   There are two kinds of people in this world. The kind who divide the
   world into two kinds of people, and the kind who don't.

   years would be a far better professor than any of those short timers.

   as a 20 year veteran, I have seen this trend. It use to be that the
   veteran teachers were the leaders, and the novice would contribute
   their new ideas and enthusiasm under the guidance of experience. Now we
   have novices implementing what are sold to them as good ideas but with
   closer inspection turn out to be detrimental in the long run. It has
   been my experience that allows me to separate the truly good ideas from
   the ones that are not.

   By driving veteran teachers out (in my state, through steadily
   declining work conditions including a highly unscientific and punitive
   evaluation system), they save money.  Not only do they not have to pay
   the higher salary of the veteran teacher, but as a friend pointed out,
   they'll almost never have to pay a pension.  Healthcare costs are also
   low when your average employee is 20-something.  Meanwhile they'll
   funnel millions to testing companies, consultants, and computer
   companies.

   Spent years in Germany. I see this repeated time and time again in many
   different fields. Germany has a mandatory retirement age of 67 (it was
   recently lifted from 65). If a company wants a person to employ a
   person beyond the mandatory retirement age, they had to get special
   permission from the federal government.  This seems to be a by-product
   of attempts to provide career opportunities for younger generations.
   Like it or not, this is a necessary side effect of social welfare.

 It was exactly this type of situation ([3196]0+ / 0-)

   that led to our decision to homeschool.  We'd had our kids at a charter
   school that went through four principals in three years, and the
   teacher turnover rate was nearly as bad.  It was a nightmare.
   Ironically, we'd chosen a charter school because we liked the idea of
   alternative education for our kids, where teachers were given free rein
   and allowed more creativity in the classroom.

   Thank you, I hadn't realized until reading this that we were witnessing
   the rule rather than the exception.  It's deplorable that our culture
   continues to devalue not only education, but the wisdom that comes with
   age and experience as well.

 THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU ([3199]0+ / 0-)

   I am so sick of people, especially progressives, who devalue the labor
   of professional educators.  I am sick of (some) young teachers who view
   their older colleagues in negative ways, dismiss their advice as if it
   has no value.

   I am a veteran teacher, now retired, but still substituting
   occasionally.  I started teaching in 1967 and retired in 2004.  But
   since 2004, I did several long term sub positions, and now continue to
   sub but only short term.

   I hear from students fairly regularly, especially since the internet.
   Their feedback has always been a way for me to look back and learn what
   impressed their memories about our time together.  The strengths in
   subject areas I felt for myself were always math and social sciences.
   But my best asset, I believe, was giving my 6th grade (mostly though a
   few years of 5th and a few as the media center/librarian/technology
   educator) students a sense of belonging and trust, an enthusiasm and
   excitement for learning regardless of the subject.   I shared my
   enthusiasm with them whether it was music or art or sports.  They
   remember those things.   Joie de vivre is a hallmark of a good learning
   environment.   My early years were when 6th was in elementary school
   and so I got to teach all subjects and I LOVED IT.   I did not have to
   be an expert in all those areas and often, I learned along side my
   students.  When computers first came into the buildings, I was hooked.
     I started my MA in technology ed before I even owned a computer.   As
   new computers would come into the building, I, along with my students,
   learned all about them, stumbling along the way, but learning.  It was
   exciting. I felt it and more importantly my students did. But then, I
   was not instructed, forced, demanded to use my time more wisely, in
   drill and practice, for the purpose of higher scores on some test.
   We, as a society, have lost sight of the value given our children, when
   they are allowed to explore, to fail, to try again.   We have allowed
   the corporations turn our teachers into the conduit for turning
   students into drones.   Those veteran teachers fighting against the
   corporatization/privatization of public education are now
   systematically and publicly demonized.

   So now, as I sub, sometimes, I see looks of disappointment from some
   teachers when they see my gray hair.  At nearly 68 years, I am a
   "senior" teacher and few seniors, like the one mentioned in the diary,
   are left in most buildings.

   In my time as a teacher, I was active in our union, was a building rep
   for many years.  In the seventies, I found myself on strike twice (two
   different districts as I had moved to a new state).  I fought
   passionately along side colleagues to keep the right of collective
   bargaining, to make sure teachers had a say so over working conditions.
     Neither time on strike was salary the issue.  Class size, curriculum
   development, building safety, student safety, health benefits were
   always top on the list.   I never went into education to get rich.  No
   one I know did.   But I did know that one of the benefits, besides
   doing what I loved, was security for health and retirement.

   I have mentored young teachers, taught graduate classes for teachers
   working on masters' degrees at both public and private colleges.  I
   have an MA in Educational Technology and a master's equivalent in
   counseling.  When I was asked for years "what do you teach?" my answer
   was always "children".   It is my belief that the best teachers are not
   subject centered but rather student centered.   A good classroom has
   the right balance of "sage on the stage" and "guide on the side".
   That balance changes often depending on the class, the child, the
   subject matter.    The best teachers' in my estimation are the ones
   whose students leave her/his class with a love of learning; with a
   thirst for knowledge;  with a joyful curiosity about everything.

   I was a good teacher when I started but I had so much to learn and
   often my students were my teachers.    My unbridled enthusiasm helped
   me in the early years but experience made me a much better teacher
   decades later.

   TFA scares me because it has gained such a foothold in the minds of the
   public.  When inexperienced (and in my opinion, less than mediocre)
   educators like Michelle Rhee are given so much power and voice, we have
   lost our way.  I am saddened about the lack of support from this
   president for public education; disgusted with Arne Duncan and his
   philosophy given such credence; and stunned at the progressive
   community's lack of support for public education.

   I believe that turnover in staff at schools is not good, especially in
   poor communities.  Consistency and trust are needed in schools but the
   lack of public support for public education is killing off those
   things.   Experienced teachers can and do role model for younger
   teachers but younger teachers need to be open to the fact that
   experience does matter.

   Again thank you for this diary.

 Children DON'T invest themselves in their educatio ([3202]0+ / 0-)

   education when there is high teacher turn over.  It doesn't matter the
   school.

   A friend of mine learned this when he taught in a private Catholic
   school in NYC.  When he started the kids asked if he was going to stay,
   because they were so used to having teachers leave they didn't want to
   put in their time, if the teacher wasn't going to commit to them.

   He loved the job but ended up leaving after the first year because the
   pay was so low he could not cover his bills, much less the loans for
   his education.

   Consistency, continuity and relationships are important to children and
   their education.  It doesn't matter the grade.

   K-3 where they will have the same teacher all day long, but a different
   teacher as they move through the grades, provides a "known" when things
   are shaky in the new year or when things go bad during the year.  Do
   under estimate the power of just being able to wave to someone.

   4-8 where a child moves to different classrooms but may have different
   teachers every year, same thing... plus having someone your older
   friends or sib had is also less scary and calming (despite possible
   reports of what an harpy/orge the teacher is .... it's a known)

   9-12 where a teen may often have the same teacher through out the years
   for various classes in history or math, etc.   A known, a constant ...
   you already know what's expected ... you've already developed a
   relationship.

   Consistency, continuity and relationships are actually the argument FOR
   homeschooling . . . especially for itinerant military families.

   No teacher's "got this" in their second year, even if they homeschool.
    Mentor paring programs are essential to teacher development.

   This could rightly (also) be seen as another front in class warfare.
   Expensive private schools brag about their teacher experience, how long
   they've been doing this, the continuity, etc.

   Teacher experience, teacher rention are marks of a healthy school,
   especially charter and private.

   How many professions like "public school teacher" that now require
   advanced degrees, get so little pay and so little respect?

   socialism? GET OFF the Interstate highway!"
