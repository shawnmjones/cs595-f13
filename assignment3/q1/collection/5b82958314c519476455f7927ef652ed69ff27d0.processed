[22]The U.S. has learned nothing from Europe's deadly obsession with
austerity

   Alexander Kokolakis, a high school student in Greece, sent a letter
   this week to Greece's Minister of Finance, [29]schooling him on basic
   economic theory.

   Quoting p. 183 of his Principles in Economic Theory book, which
   explains that in times of recession and high unemployment "the budget
   should be in deficit" and that there should be "greater expenditure by
   the State through public spending in order to increase income and to
   avoid as much as possible a recession," the student challenged the
   eurozone's austerity policies as implemented by Greece:

     "What are you doing, Mr. Finance Minister? The exact opposite. You
     increase taxes on the low-income and impoverished class and incomes
     are increasingly reduced, without these acts having meaningful
     results, other than to drag us deeper into the recession. What are
     the consequences of these actions? They've destroyed the dreams of
     thousands of young people (like my own at this point) forcing them
     to migrate abroad for a better future. Unemployment rates are
     skyrocketing and quality of life for citizens is decreasing even
     though they have no responsibility for the situation thus formed,
     for which the political system is solely responsible.

   The student begs the Finance Minister to stop the austerity policies
   and ends his letter with this postscript:

     P.S. If during my upcoming exams I am asked what policy applies
     during times of recession, what should I write as the correct
     answer? That we must have a budget surplus with increased taxes and
     decreased benefits, as you practice, or a deficit, which is what the
     book says is needed since we must increase spending and income to
     get out of the recession?

   Europe's handling of its economic crisis has been astonishingly inept,
   with the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and
   the European Commission demanding brutal austerity measures that defy
   both common sense and compassion. You would think that the U.S.,
   looking across the Atlantic to a European wasteland filled with record
   high employment rates, collapsing middle classes, and massive poverty,
   would think twice before acting on the same type of austerity here at
   home.

   The debt and deficit fetishists reign supreme in America, however, and
   unless some courageous folks in Congress hold the line against
   European-style austerity here in the U.S., things are going to get much
   worse.

   For the grisly details, head below the fold.

   Any politician in Congress who believes America will be on stronger
   footing if we cut benefits provided through social programs like Social
   Security, Medicare or Medicaid is either ignorant or heartless, or
   both.

   Two weeks ago, a [30]study published in The Lancet found that austerity
   is literally killing European citizens:

     "Greece, Spain, and Portugal adopted strict fiscal austerity; their
     economies continue to recede and strain on their health-care systems
     is growing. Suicides and outbreaks of infectious diseases are
     becoming more common in these countries, and budget cuts have
     restricted access to health care. By contrast, Iceland rejected
     austerity through a popular vote, and the financial crisis seems to
     have had few or no discernible effects on health."

   Austerity is killing dreams as well.

   For the first time since the eurozone was formed, [31]unemployment
   reached a record high of 12%. Nearly 1 out of every 3 people in Spain
   and Greece are out of work. The numbers for youths like Alexander
   Kolakis are even worse. Spain's youth unemployment rate is at 55.7%,
   while Greece's rose to 58.4 last month.
   Chart of eurozone employment
   Europe's focus on harsh austerity to the exclusion of pro-growth
   policies has resulted in record unemployment across the eurozone area.
   Simply put, the byproduct of Europe's budgetary slash-and-burn has been
   less medicine, less jobs, less security and less money for the vast
   majority of families. In seeking to balance their budgets on the backs
   of the middle and impoverished classes, Europe has created a deficit of
   hope, one where far too many Europeans are living day-by-day, with no
   end to their nightmare in sight.

   Rather than look at the results of that austerity with shock and
   horror, too many politicians here in America shrug off Europe's
   catastrophe as, well, a European problem.

   Europe's experiment though has validated a universal truth often
   repeated by the world's top economists: you cannot cut your way to
   growth. Still, Republicans and their Democratic enablers in Congress
   seek to implement the same type of policy that [32]even the IMF
   confessed was in error.

   Sequestration is America's mini-version of Europe's austerity
   experiment, and it's producing similar shocking results, from American
   [33]cancer patients on Medicare being turned away from clinics to
   [34]clinics, daycares, and other essential services being shut down or
   cut back in local communities across the country. Yes, Europe's agony
   can happen here. In fact, it's already starting.

   It's always been the conservative's dream to have a government small
   enough it could be drowned in a bathtub. With sequestration, they've
   made it small enough to be tied down and waterboarded a bit. The effect
   of austerity, even on a smaller scale, is still hellish.

   Government isn't some abstract, third-party entity that works against
   us. It is us. It's nurses, educators, firemen, police officers, men and
   women in uniform, doctors and scientists. Government saves and improves
   lives every minute of every day. In times of economic crisis, people
   need that government and the social safety nets it administers to be
   stronger, not weaker.

   That's economics and ethics 101.

   Will Congress pay attention to what's happening in Europe and finally
   change its course?

   For the sake of us all, let's hope so.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       We have witnessed it fail in Europe, and we witnessed the success,
       such as it was, of a stimulus policy, such as it was. We have to
       know which works better by now, don't we?

   ...the wealthy get.

   By now, we've all seen the articles discussing the disconnect between
   the political concerns of the wealthy (who are worried about deficits)
   and everyone else (who are worried about jobs).

   Unfortunately, the 1% have disproportionate influence on the
   discussion, and not just because they have the money to donate to
   campaigns.  It's also a factor that the politicians and the DC press
   corp tend to hang around with a wealthier cohort who push deficit
   reduction and austerity.  I suspect that the result is that many of the
   pundits and politicians really do believe that the "average person" is
   worried about deficits.  Their mistake is that they assume that the
   people around them are "average".

   Austerity works just fine, thank you.  It punishes those it is intended
   to punish, and benefits those it is intended to benefit.  It wreaks the
   damage it is supposed to wreak.

   Don't mistake the cover story for the real goal.  Everything is going
   according to plan.  The mission really is being  accomplished.    If it
   does not seem that way to you, that's because it's not for you.

   But what is happening in Europe, in Greece and Cyprus for example, is
   that countries are begging for bailouts and to get the money they have
   to promise not to be spendthrifts.  Each of the countries is free to
   refuse bailouts and stimulate their own economies.  Greece could have
   done just that, but when the crisis struck Greeks shipped their money
   out of the country.  They send out many times the amount of money as
   what they want in bailouts.   Ironically a lot of Greek money was
   hidden in Cypriot banks where it is now going to be bailed in to rescue
   the Cypriot economy.  The brutal truth is that most of the weak
   economies of the Eurozone are weak because they refuse to work and
   sacrifice for their national economic well being.  If countries like
   Greece want to prosper they must make socialist sacrifices in order to
   produce their wealth on their own even if it means renouncing hand outs
   (with strings attached) and accept bankruptcy.

       Euro-zone countries like Greece do not have control of their
       currency; that's the fundamental difference between them and the
       U.S., and why we will nver "end up like Greece."  The U.S.
       government cannot run out of money -- Greece can.
       For this reason, Greece couldn't refuse a bailout and stimulate its
       own economy.  At least not without going bankrupt.

   most basic concepts of economics....How do we measure an

   GDP = (G)ovt spending + (C)onsumer spending + (I)nvestment spending +

   In a simple algebraic equation...the burden of proof is on the people
   who would have us believe that you can decrease one of the integer
   variables and somehow get a increased result....Thats not how math
   works.....

   Now, I can understand why the Cons don't trust math, they want nothing

       It is literally the best political book I've ever read.  It
       explains and puts into context everything that's happened since the
       2008 crash -- even though it was written before that.  At the time
       it came out, my naive thinking was "it's terrible what they're
       doing to these third world countries, but at least they don't dare
       do it here."  But that was before the crash -- everything we've
       seen since then has been the shock doctrine applied to the US
       economy.

       I don't anyone can seriously claim that in Greece there wasn't a
       need for some level of budget cuts. The depth and pace of those
       cuts, however, were ill-advised by the troika.
       Austerity bills slashed public sector pay by over 1/3 while private
       sector wages (minimum wage) were decreased by over 20%.
       Because of the austerity, 1 in three Greeks lives at or below the
       poverty level. That's insane.
       The problem with how the troika handled Greece was that their
       strategy was initially premised on containment, not stimulus. The
       first bailouts didn't go towards stimulating Greece's economy.
       Billions of euros were spent simply to shore up the European
       banking system that had exposure to Greek debt. In fact, The New
       York Times reported that bailout funds were wired from European
       banks to an escrow account in Athens that the Greek government
       couldn't touch and then wired back to European banks days later for
       debt service.
       So yes, while Greece didn't have the choice of taking some level of
       austerity off the table, it certainly didn't have to acquiesce so
       quickly to the depth of austerity demanded by the troika or the
       terms which largely focused on debt service for too long to the
       exclusion of a real stimulus program that would have helped
       strengthen Greece's economy and in turn, its negotiating position
       on bonds, debt, etc.

       The theory at the beginning of this crisis was that a "Grexit"
       would spark worldwide economic catastrophe by cratering markets,
       undermining the EU and setting a template for fracturing of the
       eurozone entirely. Europe buys 20% of what America exports. Our
       economies are tied at the hip, so there was enormous pressure for
       Greece to accept any conditions necessary to stay in the eurozone.
       In fact, there was a lot of debate at the time about exactly how
       Greece would leave the eurozone even if it wanted to (none of the
       eurozone documents provide for that scenario).
       Greece took the austerity hit believing that in doing so, it was
       essentially saving the world from economic collapse. Little did it
       know that the policies it was accepting would result in an internal
       collapse of its society and social safety nets.

       and certainly Greece was under heavy pressure to not leave the EU.
        But that doesn't mean that they had no choice but to do what they
       did in the way that they did it.  In fact, the way you describe the
       scenario, there's something incredibly ironic and tragic in how
       Greece was punished for its motivation to stay.

       just like the US population. When we need inclusive policies toward
       people and regulatory policies toward corporations (banks included)
       then we can achieve some progress. Currently we are in a whirlpool
       and the current is opposite where we should be.
       I have an idea though: We can ALL work for our respective
       governments. If that happens we don't have a dysfunctional (bought
       or corrupt) Congress- we have true representation through our
       union.
       It's going to take some visionary leadership and some problem
       solving. I recommend Alexander Kokolakis be given a position of
       authority and responsibility immediately.

 Greece ([687]0+ / 0-)
       This is a serious misinterpretation of history here. Then in
       reality if the greek government would have been honest they never
       would have been in the Eurozone - as they never fulfilled the
       criteria to join.
       Instead they forged the statistics (with help of Goldman Sachs
       apparently) to be able to join the Eurozone.
       This fueled half a decade of  a boom cycle , because of low
       interest rates - they never would have had outside of the Euro and,
       surging wages (prices I dont know but probably as well) and
       massively surging private and government debt even in better
       economic times.
       In my opinion the whole western world made the same mistake. AFAIK
       Keynes theory consisted of 2 Parts - spend to grow  in times of
       economic trouble and repay your debt in good times. The second part
       is nearly universally ignored because its much easier to spend the
       money to please the citizens or lower taxes instead of repaying the
       debt.
       Now the whole House of Cards collapses and even if I see the
       problems austerity causes and find the austerity course wrong -
       even if we spend ourselves out of teh crisis - I would not bet on
       the population/government to see the need to repay debt in times
       that are better economically.

     Europe's handling of its economic crisis has been astonishingly
     inept

   If the people doing this finished high school, and can read, they know
   that what they are doing is siphoning off wealth -- actually stealing
   every penny they can -- from the lesser people and into their own
   pockets.

   "Inept" and such words mask the reality that by all common sense, the
   results are fully intentional. They have to be. You have to posit a
   special "Miracle of Intellectual Blindness touching only Government and
   the Financial Class" to account for the results they get if you want to
   claim it's stupidity.

   As far as I can tell -- and there's been several remarks and actions by
   the IMF and other Money People to the effect -- Cyprus is the template
   for the next widespread level of theft. Again, not coincidence, not
   stupidity, not incompetence.

   The contrary.

       I don't think that eurozone leaders want this economic crisis. The
       last thing Germany wants is the flood of foreign workers pouring
       over its borders.
       That said, policies aren't necessarily being implemented just with
       an eye toward sound economic policy. Giorgos Chatzimarkakis, a
       German member of European Parliament, announced this week that
       [791]he's not running for reelection because of how the eurozone
       has treated Greece, Cyprus and other indebted countries. He made a
       point to emphasize that far too often, Germany's policies towards
       those countries are based on cultural stereotypes rather than the
       facts on the ground.
       As to Cyprus, yes, it is being tested as a template. Can you
       imagine the response here if they took away 60% of our savings
       accounts to bailout the banks? It's a tragedy and an outrage. No
       other words for it.

   It's 2015.

   You are Barack Obama.

   2014 was a GOP wave election on the back of over a year of "I/we
   oppose/opposed the Democrat Party/Obama/Reid/Pelosi Social Security
   cuts". Citizens United was a tsunami of Social Security shit from
   minute one.

   52-3 Republican Senators. Jessie Helms would be a moderate.
   240 House Republicans Representatives. Child labor law repeals were
   floated.

   It's fucking crazytime. A real political pigfuck.

   Nothing was unworthy of a subpoena or sworn testimony.

   You are watching Senator Ted Cruz or Senator Ron Johnson or Senator
   Paul Broun, basically whoever won the caucus knife-fight over who was
   going to be the fucking craziest in the cloakroom before the vote to
   get the nod, loudly gavel in a gobsmacking ratfuck of a hearing on Ben
   Ghazi or the Fast and the Furious or some shit they just made up.

   This is the rest of your time in office.

   The House Republicans are talking about who are going to be their
   impeachment managers. It's a real fight, too. There is some serious bad
   blood over who is going to be the hardest on the administration. There
   are enough Democrats left to, maybe, block your removal from office if
   the filibuster isn't nuked to get rid of you, but not enough Democrats
   to block your being impeached. Ron Fournier and Fred Hiatt are
   entertained as all hell by your plight. The same people in the Village
   who demanded austerity are now gleefully covering each and every fake
   outrage and impeachment rumor like it's Watergate, Iran-Contra, and the
   whole Arkansas Project on crack and steroids.

   How can you not realize, at that moment, that none of this had to
   happen, that you helped, insanely, to do this to yourself?

   Setting aside that austerity is bad policy, which it is, it is also bad
   politics.

   There is no upside to it. None.

   If you are a non-Movement Conservative, Fred Hiatt, Ron Fournier can't
   protect you. Alan Simpson and Pete Peterson don't give a shit about
   protecting you.

   Even if you can't be convinced to be against it because you really want
   what you think is going to be the good parts of it down the line, you
   should be against it because your life is going to turn to shit because
   of it.

   Barack Obama will never face the voters again, this is true.

   What he will, potentially, have to face is Ted Cruz with a gavel and
   subpoena power. The Democrats who lose their jobs if, say, Chained CPI
   were to pass into law, would probably get the better deal by just
   losing their seats in an election.

   The President could get slowly autopsied by the crazies until he's
   either impeached or leaves office.

   Think a moment.  For the last two centuries, the American economy has
   been a growth machine.  The only thing necessary to assure growth, has
   been for national policies not to be too damned stupid for too long.
   The world economy was expanding, technology was increasing at
   ever-more-rapid pace, and therefore while fiscal tight-fistedness could
   slow that trend down, it wouldn't reverse it, while economic investment
   paid secure dividends.

   But this isn't your grandmother's world anymore.  Infinite growth
   simply is not possible for anything in a finite universe, even less so
   on a small planet that lacks effective transport technology to escape
   the gravity well, the magnetic shield, and the solar system.  The
   limits to economic growth and human population have been exceeded
   already; we can't continue at the pace we've been going, let alone
   expand.  Our waste products already threaten to upset the long-term
   climate balance to which our biology is adapted.

   In this context, NEW wealth isn't going to be created (no growth).
   Economics becomes a zero sum game; nobody can increase their portion of
   the pie without taking it from someone else.  It's quite possible that
   the wealthy who own and operate the economic system for their own
   survival and profit have moved into cannibalistic mode, where they are
   deliberately scavenging whatever scraps of wealth they can from
   wherever and whoever has them, intent on draining everything they can
   into their own coffers.  There's simply no point (from their position)
   in trying to maintain the overall health of the system; at this time
   that would cost them without returning any profits.  And of course the
   governments and national banks continue to dance to their tune.

   Austerity moves more money to the 1% and allows them to buy a more

   It also allows the wealthy to raid our SS funds by reducing taxes on

 In the US... ([911]0+ / 0-)
       ...there are probably 50 million people who make more than $50k
       (from tax return data).
       The EU has a population of $500 million, so assuming the same
       population, between the US and EU figure there are 120 million
       people or so making over $50k.
       After that there isn't a whole lot. If we triple that number to add
       in contributions from the rest of the world, we get a number that's
       roughly 360 million, or a little over 5% of the global population
       of 7 billion.
       So ok, fair enough. I forget where I got the statistic from now,
       but it looks more likely that $50k is top 5% instead of top 1%. Top
       1% is probably closer to $80k by the numbers.

   Recommended by:
          [924]Gooserock, [925]MeToo, [926]dadoodaman, [927]Zaq

   different things.  In MittWorld, it means channeling money from
   government into the hands of rich people -- the investor class -- so
   that they can invest.  In Japan it meant using public funds for
   construction projects geared toward a politically overrepresented rural
   sector: not very helpful to the young and marginally employed.

   U.S. investment in basic services is necessary; investment in new
   technology is also important; but I think government should go beyond
   that.   As I look at the stores of a nearby mall, I immediately see too
   much supply and too little demand, because the cash just isn't out
   there.  We need an injection of cash back into the economy, starting at
   the low end.  Find the people at the bottom and give them money.  Not
   hit-or-miss droplets of charity, but a broad and substantive infusion
   of capital.

   With some real generosity, the economy could get moving again, and the
   billionaires would once again be rolling in it. The difference is that
   they would live in a country that is significantly richer.  Some will
   worry that wages might go up, but that does not seem to be a bad thing.

       It is no coincidence that the minimum wage has been stuck for the

       has funneled upwards, but the economy can only be sucked dry for so

     It has become commonplace to contrast the American and European
     responses to the Great Recession, with stimulus in the former and
     austerity in the latter. European austerity has been at the level of
     member states and local governments -- there is no meaningful

   has even spread to Australia, which has the 3rd lowest debt to GDP
   ratio in the world. When money has never been this cheap, Australian
   politicians are fretting about the deficit! This would normally be a
   time for a country like Australia to initiate some really big projects
   like national broadband, building out high speed rail, decarbonizing
   the economy, etc. But all they can do is sit in the corner and quiver
   in fear. If a vibrant, truly strong economy like Australia is doing
   this, what hope elsewhere?

 It's not about good economics it's about ([1118]0+ / 0-)

   ownership. When the haves loan money to the have-nots and the economy
   gets weak the haves start to panic and demand that their investment is
   secure. If the government bails out the banks then the government had
   better stop spending money on social programs and had better get busy
   taxing enough to keep those loan repayments on schedule. It all has to
   do with accumulation of wealth and during this period in history we are
   talking about obscene wealth at the cost of income to the broad
   population. Ironic, eh. Income maldistribution and speculation causes
   broad based debt and that is exactly what the wealthy want to protect
   by castrating economies. If the increase in productivity over the
   decades had been evenly distributed massive debt would have been
   avoided, the global economy would not have crashed and the wealthy
   would not have to protect those loans with Draconian austerity.

   whom austerity helps. That's the rentier class, who benefit from the
   greatly-cheaper labor which no longer has a viable safety net to turn
   to, or public employment to compete with the crumbs their 0.1% feudal
   overlords toss them.

   Want to know the real rationale behind austerity? It's a philosophy of
   the rentiers, by the rentiers' paid think-tanks, for the rentiers.

   At no point does the good of the nation as a whole enter the discourse
   in an austerity-dominated discussion.

     You would think that the U.S., looking across the Atlantic to a
     European wasteland filled with record high employment rates,
     collapsing middle classes, and massive poverty, would think twice
     before acting on the same type of austerity here at home.

   The US has already destroyed its middle class, forced millions into
   poverty, and offers up less than living wage jobs with no benefits or
   protections to its workers. The GOP has been wanting to roll back the
   little safety net Americans do enjoy for decades. They've been wanting
   to drown government in a bathtub for how long now?

   Both the Democrats and the Republicans have presided over the greatest
   shift in wealth in American history. BOTH of them have. They both
   answer to the same paymaster while dangling social issues (that should
   have been decided decades ago) in front of the American people to get
   us to fight one another while robbing us blind.

   If the wealth chasm were imaginary, I'm certain that the US would be
   pushing austerity at home. The sad thing is, they don't need to
   anymore. They already got your money, now they want the European middle
   classes cash as well.

   If these global plutocrats get their way, the US will sign a free trade
   agreement with the EU. Once that happens, we (Europeans) can say
   good-bye to social democracy. The plutocrats hate the social
   democracies in Europe. The weak ones they can snuff out with austerity
   while the stronger ones will be laid low by "competition" with American
   workers whose employers and government couldn't care less about them.

   for testing how far you can go with austerity before a revolution
   starts.

   The European Central Bank, headed by a former Goldman-Sachs man, and
   the IMF, the international debt-collection thugs now headed by an
   American international law firm and capitol-hill intern, are focused
   solely on furthering private banking interests. The European
   Commission, the third party in the troika has as much economic
   understanding as a celebrity lapdog ... oops, I forgot that's basically
   how they see themselves, I suppose.

   Personally, I'm surprise, and slightly amazed at how much so many are
