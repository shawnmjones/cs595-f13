   Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney greets the audience at the
   end of the final U.S. presidential debate in Boca Raton, Florida
   October 22, 2012. REUTERS/Win McNamee/Pool (UNITED STATES - Tags:

   Totally normal.
   Mitt Romney [29]tells [DEL: comedian :DEL] radio host Dennis Miller
   he's happy to be living "a normal life" without all those annoying
   people hanging around him:

     I have to admit, being able to go back to our own life, and going to
     the grocery store and shopping on my own is kind of nice to do by
     myself without a bunch of people hanging around with me. So I like
     the life of being an American citizen. It's good to live a normal
     life again.

   So, Mitt's happy everyone is leaving him alone. I guess that means he
   didn't like the other 53 percent very much either. But I'm not so sure
   I buy the "good to live a normal life" thing, and not just because he's
   so damn weird. Check out his explanation for why ran for president in
   the first place:

     I wouldn't have gotten into this if I thought everything was going
     swimmingly. And I'm still concerned about the country and I keep
     looking for the most effective way for me to try and get the country
     on a course of remaining strong and powerful.

   He's still looking for the best way he can save America? Word to the
   wise: If you think you can save America, you're not living a normal
   life. Besides, Mitt's already done the most important thing he could do
   to achieve that goal: He lost.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [40]Tagging tips - [41]Search For Tags - [42]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [43]Civil
   Rights, [44]Community, [45]Congress, [46]Culture, [47]Economy,
   [48]Education, [49]Elections, [50]Energy, [51]Environment, [52]Health
   Care, [53]International, [54]Labor, [55]Law, [56]Media, [57]Meta,
   [58]National Security, [59]Science, [60]Transportation, or [61]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([62]California, [63]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Who the HELL believes this guy who serves himself first at every
       family dinner, and is done eating before the rest get through the
       buffet, is out there grocery shopping. (anecdote supplied by his
       own children, btw)
       What a fucking crock of shit.  And this is the same guy who told
       Fox news just a couple of weeks ago that it's driving him crazy
       that he isn't the president?
       Jesus christ on a pogo stick.  I so want to be done with ever
       commenting on anything about Mitt Romney again.  Because let's face
       it, his political future is dead as dead can be, without any zombie
       uprising possible.
       But the combination of the INSULT of having to live through 2 years
       of his incompetent blathering as the best the GOP could vomit up as
       a candidate, combined with the PROFOUND relief that America proved
       herself still able to pull the trap door on this kind of ass hat,
       just has not yet ebbed for me.
       Tomorrow's another day. And I just know, one of these days, we're
       all going to get over Mitt and move on, no matter how he  tries to
       grab our attention.

   My first thought on reading this in the reglar media was that Romney
   must be really desperate to go on the DM show.

   It's the perfect venue for D-List politicians.

   He's pissed. He had this thing, all the unskewed polls and unskewed

   He's not happy he's not President. Nobody runs to lose. Nobody who runs
   for office is "glad" to be a lucky loser who gets to go back to being
   'not President' or 'not Governor' anymore. If he were a winner, he'd be
   getting his ring kissed by Limbaugh and not scraping the bottom of the
   wingnut barrell with... Dennis Miller. That's like winning a dream date
   with Michelle Shocked these days.

   Light an illegal cuban cigar with a c note and cackle about how while

   brand spanking new clone body is being prepared in a secret lab as we
   speak as a 'fuck you' consolation prize.

   You're not fucking nice, Mitt.

   It's all an act. This is just another big front. Like a bunch of rich
   white people who all hate each other to death and back getting together
   on Thanksgiving and making each other suffer in silent misery and fake

   I have zero respect for Mittster, lying or otherwise.  He only set out
   to keep more money for himself.  Taxes.  That was his issue.  He has
   money and wants to keep more of it for himself and his corporate church
   and the hell with everyone else.

       I have lived my life among the LDS, and noticed from the beginning
       how much of Mitt's plans, speech and thoughts came from his staunch
       religious beliefs.
       Joseph Smith once ran for President. Mitt was back to serving on
       another mission when he ran in 2008, and I'm sure that he felt he
       came home early when he dropped out.
       Like many missionaries, he came back in 2012, determined to serve
       to the end this time.
       I can't even imagine how he would have screwed up the country if he
       had been elected. Devout Mormons like Mitt are proud of the
       "peculiar people" tag someone hung on them over 100 years ago. The
       devout Mormons have always seen themselves as a people who are
       special and apart from the rest of us.
       Right many are called, and damn few are chosen.

       Yes, I agree that Mitt would have been bad for the LDS church.  I
       had a really close Mormon friend that was terrified of the
       spotlight.  She was afraid of the traditions and 'rules' that she
       lives by coming out in the open.  She said the Mormon church likes
       to reveal the religion in 'stages' to possible converts so they
       don't freak out.  Like warming up bath water a little at a time for
       a steam bath result.  She takes high does of anti-depressants to
       get through the day.  As does her daughter...  to deal with the way
       women are treated in the LDS church.
       I know lefty Mormons.  I can live with lefties.  They don't push
       their beliefs onto anyone.  But lefties are less than 30% of the
       Mormon church.  The church needs to change in a big way.  The only
       thing that speaks is money.  Starve the beast and you can set the
       rules before you feed it again.  The LDS church needs a mass exodus
       to give it a reality check.
       Just like the Catholics had a chunk of their population break off
       to become Lutheran, I think the Mormon church needs a similar
       break.  I think my atheist ex-Mo friends would still be atheist,
       but live and function in a lefty Mormon church just for the
       communal benefits.  The one thing they all say is that they don't
       want to go broke paying 'dues' to the church.
       I called it the 'corporate church' but I got that term from them.
       They described how it is so hard to break away from the Mormon
       church if you do business with anyone in the church because that
       will all come to a screeching halt when you leave the church.  My
       hard core Mormon friend told me about how the Mormon church tries
       to keep as much money within the church as possible by first doing
       business with other Mormon businesses and only going out of that
       ring if it can't be found in that ring.  So, sell widgets to
       everyone, but make sure the widgets get made by Mormon business
       supplying the parts, etc..  Bring money in...keep it in.  Freedom
       comes with a high price tag in the Mormon church.
       But I think the spotlight is on the Mormon church anyway.  The
       internet makes it so.  That is why my atheist ex-Mo friends left
       the church.  They did their own research.  They doubted the hard
       lines and went in search of answers.  The church suffers the same
       affliction the republican party suffers....it is controlled by
       conservative old white men that write rules to serve
       themselves...and that isn't working very well.  Pretty soon, the
       Mormon church will be down to those doing business with one another
       as they will be trapped financially to stay.  The Mormon friend on
       anti-depressants I mentioned above....she has steered her sons into
       work outside of the church ring.  Is that telling?
