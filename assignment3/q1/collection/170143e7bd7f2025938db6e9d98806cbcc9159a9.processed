Poll Question

   [49]Gov. Paul LePage

   AUGUSTA, Maine -- Two powerful moderate Republicans in the Maine
   Legislature are calling on Gov. Paul LePage to apologize for comments
   he made last week alleging corruption by midlevel managers in state
   government.

   Sen. Roger Katz of Augusta and Rep. Patrick Flood of Winthrop -- the
   co-chairmen of the Appropriations Committee -- each released statements
   on Monday in response to remarks LePage made [52]last week at a town
   hall forum in Newport. The comments referred to middle management as
   being "about as corrupt as you can be."

   "For our governor to question their integrity, to essentially call them
   morally depraved -- look it up -- is demeaning and inexcusable," Katz
   wrote on Monday. "I respectfully suggest that those comments are not
   worthy of the chief executive. To date, he has resisted calls from many
   of us to apologize for what he said, and we hope he will change his
   mind.

   "But in the meantime we can certainly speak for ourselves and suggest
   this kind of wholesale attack on good Maine people is wrong and has no
   place in this building."

   Katz said that a large percentage of state workers live within his
   district and he considered many of them to be his neighbors and
   friends. He pointed out that some make less than they could in the
   private sector and stay because they believe in public service.

   Flood's statement was not immediately available but his colleagues on
   the Appropriations Committee said its message was similar.

   The governor's office did not respond to a request for comment on
   Monday.

   After LePage's remarks drew criticism late last week, the governor did
   draft a letter Friday to members of the Maine State Employees
   Association in which he attempted to clarify his comments.

   But the letter did not include an apology.

   "When my administration came into office, we promised Maine people we
   would not settle for the status quo," he wrote. "The culture of state
   government needed to change from `no' to `can do!' Many of you have
   taken this to heart and are doing great things for the people of Maine.

   "However, for whatever reason, some employees have not come on board.
   Roadblocks have been put up, hurdles have been thrown in the way, and
   information has not been passed up to senior management. Those
   employees want to keep doing the same thing because it was always done
   that way. Quite frankly, that attitude is unacceptable. In my opinion,
   it shows that they have been corrupted by the bureaucracy."

   LePage then accused union bosses of telling employees to "ride it out."

   The comments were the latest in a bitter battle between the LePage
   administration and the MSEA, the state's largest union. A protracted
   fight over a new collective bargaining agreement has persisted for
   months and is likely to be settled through court proceedings.

   The MSEA was the first group to take exception to LePage's latest
   comments.

   "All Mainers can take great pride in the men and women who work for the
   state of Maine," Ginette Rivard, the union's president, said in a
   statement Friday. "These public workers do important work for all Maine
   people. For Gov. LePage to call them `corrupt' is baseless and
   insulting to every public worker who has dedicated their lives to
   making Maine a great place to live, work and raise a family."

   In addition to the MSEA, some Democrats last week called the governor's
   rhetoric out of line. Sen. Dawn Hill, D-Cape Neddick, said Mainers
   deserve leaders who work for them, not against them.

   "The governor's negative name calling is unacceptable and
   unprofessional," Hill said. "He is making unfounded accusations against
   hardworking Mainers. His divisive rhetoric must end and the
   conversation must return to a place of civility."

   The Democratic response was predictable, but Republicans calling out
   their governor has been relatively rare since LePage took office.

   It was about one year ago that [53]a group of eight Senate Republicans
   called out LePage in an OpEd that ran in several daily newspapers.

   That response came on the heels of a string of controversial comments
   made by LePage during the first part of his tenure in office.

   "We feel compelled to express our discomfort and dismay with the tone
   and spirit of some of the remarks coming from him," the piece read.
   "Were this an isolated incident and not a pattern, we would bite our
   collective tongues, because we are all human. But, unfortunately, such
   is not the case. We feel we must speak out.

   "By demeaning others, the governor also discourages people from taking
   part in debating the issues of the day -- worrying if not only their
   ideas, but they themselves as people, will be the subject of scorn."

   Katz was one of the primary authors of that OpEd, but it was signed by
   Sens. Nichi Farnham of Bangor, Brian Langley of Ellsworth, Tom Saviello
   of Wilton, Chris Rector of Thomaston, Thomas Martin of Benton, Earle
   McCormick of West Gardiner and Roger Sherman of Houlton.

   LePage did soften his tone somewhat after the OpEd was published.
