[22]The Supreme Court hears the same old arguments

   Generic male and female couple figures, female-female, female-male, and
   male, male.
   One of the odder things about reading Supreme Court oral arguments is
   how, well, small the discussion is. The questions being asked are
   questions that have been hashed out at dinner tables for years or even
   decades; I don't know if any more ought to be expected, but it's still
   odd to see Justice Scalia muttering phrases that seem to have come
   directly from talk radio, or to hear lawyers before the Greatest Court
   In The Land bringing up or knocking down strawmen that most of the rest
   of us thought had been dispensed with a very long time ago.

   Case in point: Tuesday arguments before the Court, which centered for
   long periods of time around whether or not "procreation" was the
   be-all, end-all of marriage definitions, as the anti-marriage equality
   side had claimed in its briefs. Wouldn't that mean that old or
   infertile people shouldn't be allowed to marry? And isn't that
   ridiculous on its face?

   [29]Here's how Justice Kagan asked the question:

     "Suppose a State said that, `Because we think that the focus of
     marriage really should be on procreation, we are not going to give
     marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over
     the age of 55.' Would that be constitutional?"

   And here's how Charles Cooper, advocate for the pro-Proposition 8 side,
   argued his case:

     "[S]ociety's interest in responsible procreation isn't just with
     respect to the procreative capacities of the couple itself. The
     marital norm, which imposes the obligations of fidelity and
     monogamy, Your Honor, advances the interests in responsible
     procreation by making it more likely that neither party, including
     the fertile party to that ... marriage will engage in irresponsible
     procreative conduct outside of that marriage. Outside of that
     marriage. That's the marital--that's the marital norm."

   It's all about the babies, then. Or rather, discouraging "irresponsible
   procreative conduct" that leads to out-of-wedlock babies. You see, even
   if two infertile people get married, or, say, one fertile and one
   infertile person, the state still has a general interest in seeing the
   "norm" of proper babymakin' adhered to, and that means no
   "irresponsible procreative conduct," and that means no gays because ...
   wait, what?

   If you can make any sense of Cooper's word salad, you're a talented
   soul. But while the question of whether the state's interest in
   marriage was all about the baby-making was (yet again) hashed out, none
   of the justices seemed to follow up on the one thing I would have loved
   to see Cooper explain. If, as Cooper says, the state interest is to
   ensure that neither party in the marriage "will engage in irresponsible
   procreative conduct outside of that marriage"--how do you figure gay
   Americans are more likely to engage in extramarital "procreative
   conduct," fella? I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the
   number of accidental pregnancies resulting from irresponsible gay sex
   is, on the Famous Accidental Pregnancies scale of things, vanishingly
   low. It's not known to be a big problem.

   That's what's frequently so surprising about these oral arguments.
   You've got lawyers making arguments that have been shot down over and
   over again, arguments that have been dull for decades, and arguments
   that aren't even internally consistent from paragraph to paragraph. In
   this case, perhaps we should just be interpreting it as the
   anti-equality side simply having a harder and harder time mustering up
   any sensible argument at all?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [46]Civil
   Rights, [47]Community, [48]Congress, [49]Culture, [50]Economy,
   [51]Education, [52]Elections, [53]Energy, [54]Environment, [55]Health

   [61]National Security, [62]Science, [63]Transportation, or [64]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([65]California, [66]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   and there never will be.

   I married when I was 29 and got a vasectomy. 16 years later the
   marriage is as real as anything. Don't like kids, don't want kids but
   the marriage is real.

   It is not only poor logic, it is insulting the to number of childfree
   married couples.

   In my opinion marriage is an economic arrangement, the rest is window
   dressing. An arrangement we are denying to certain couples in society.

       I'm a woman, and the primary wage earner (I earn more than double
       my husband's salary).  I'm an atheist.  We were childless by choice
       until 13 years into our marriage (changed our minds, but just one
       kiddo).  We got married at a justice of the peace.
       I have zero interest in traditional or religious-based marriage.  I
       like the economic benefits and the stability afforded by marriage,
       and that's it.  If there's an "approved purpose" to marriage, is
       someone going to challenge my right to be married if I disavow the
       approved purpose(s)?

       people who are married decide what their marriage is about for
       them.  The "norm" has no place in the law.
       The law only comes into play in determining the formalities of
       becoming married and when the consensus breaks down to the point
       they want to divorce.  There's nothing in between, really, that the
       law cares about.  Be faithful, or be swingers, have kids or not,
       live together or live a thousand miles apart.  Go see prostitutes
       dressed in diapers if your spouse is cool with it.  Nobody enforces
       the "norms" until the gays come along.
       That's not even "gun control". It's more like "massacre control".

       straight people will engage in irresponsible procreative behavior.
        (News flash:  Straight people have been doing that for millenia,
       despite the existence of marriage.)
       Let's assume this is true and that without marriage, straight folks
       will be producing children all over the place.  How on earth does
       allowing gay people to marry affect marriage's alleged restraining
       influence on straights?  Do straight people view gay weddings as
       excuses to have affairs and fornicate?
       More seriously, when you distill this argument to its essence, it's
       basically saying that gay people have to be punished because
       straight people are incapable of controlling their own sexual
       urges.

       This POV seems to be saying that marriage is needed to keep
       straight people from accidentally having kids outside of it.
       Ignoring the obvious issue that a) it doesn't stop that, and b)
       huh? It exists solely to keep things from happening without it?
       But ignore that weirdness and you get the idea that marriage is
       some sort of straightjacket that straight couples must be placed
       inside so that their accidental children can have a family. Okay,
       that's a rather insane view of marriage, but let's go with it.
       So, the logical conclusion is that...gay people, being very
       unlikely to have accidentally children, do not need to get married.
       Well, okay. I'll buy that also, pretending I am unaware of other
       reasons to get married.
       Now, why are people barring them from getting married? We know they
       don't need to be in the straightjacket that, apparently, marriage
       is (1)...but why can't they get in if they want to?
       1) Incidentally, people who keep yammering about 'defending
       marriage' might actually want to think a little more about their
       wording of what marriage is. Standing there pounding the table
       about how we must force straight couples into marriage because
       otherwise they will cause harm to their accidental children rather
       makes marriage sound like it's some sort of regulation along the
       lines of safety railing or something, and not something people
       would actually choose if given such a option freely.
       So considering we don't. despite what they think, actually require
       marriage, it might not be a clever idea for 'defending marriage' to
       stand around talking about how we force straight people to get
       married!

   There aren't going to be any bastard children from homosexual affairs.

   So what does the govt care if there are any?

   If the concern of the govt is about out of wedlock children that the
   state might need to care for, then marriage and childbearing should
   only be allowed for those with the means to care for the children.

   So no marriage and enforced contraception for a large chunk of the

     The marital norm, which imposes the obligations of fidelity and
     monogamy, Your Honor, advances the interests in responsible
     procreation by making it more likely that neither party, including
     the fertile party to that ... marriage will engage in irresponsible
     procreative conduct outside of that marriage.

   So many things are wrong with that statement. I'm not a lawyer or even
   following these SCOTUS cases much beyond the headlines, but from where
   I sit I don't see where the anti-gay argument is. They're really
   hanging this on marriage = babies & fidelity? That's ridiculous.

   Actually, his argument does have a certain logic to it.

   He is saying that one of the state's major 'stakes' in the institution
   of marriage is to ensure that babies are never created out of wedlock
   (we can see how well that works in practice but bear with me here.)

   So in his view, it is within the state's area of interest to see that
   couples stay faithful to one another, lest one of them go off and
   father/mother/whatever a child with someone else.

   In the case of homosexuals, because there is no chance (we assume, as
   everyone always does, that bisexuality does not exist) of this
   happening, the state does not have a compelling interest in making sure
   that gay couples stay faithful to one another.

   It's a novel argument, I will give it that.

       about the states. They might, however, say that if you're legally
       married, you're legally married. So you get the same rights any
       legally married couple does - survivor benefits, tax policy,
       military benefits.
       Those are federal issues, and the court can certainly rule on
       those.
       When DOMA was passed it was a moot point. No states permitted same
       sex marriage or even civil unions, so it didn't matter if the feds
       didn't recognize it. Kinda like not recognizing Martians as
       citizens.
       But now it's different, and they need to clarify if LEGALLY married
       couples should get the same benefits as any other LEGALLY married
       couple.
       And I don't see how they can rule otherwise.
       Once they do that, the states will just throw up their hands and
       recognize marriage as marriage, no matter who the couple is, even
       if they don't allow those two people to get married in THEIR state.

   Cooper's bizarro arguments make sense if you consider o' Strom to be
   yer normal man.  As there are two circumstances in which he is the
   poster child.

   1) An old man marries a young woman and they reproduce. Strom did this,
   fathering a kid sometime after 70, and amazingly enough living long
   enough to see the kid grow up.

   2) A young man shtups a woman not his wife, and she has a kid, the
   identify of whose father remains a secret for decades, until the
   offspring of the unsanctioned union is middle-aged.  Strom did this
   too, imposing his fecund white schvonz upon a woman who he couldn't
   even legally have married at the time and place had he wanted to, which
   he most certainly didn't, since African-American women were treated as
   sort of a "droit de seigneur" privilege of southern white men.

   Now honoring the vows of gay marriage doesn't prevent either of those
   fatherins', so it doesn't fit into their Strom-like model of sexuality
   and family.

   marriage exists.

   They are, you know.

   Arguments about 55 year olds are just as silly as requiring perfectly
   responsible people to get background checks before buying guns.

   The reason you let 55 year olds get married (aside from the fact that
   there is really no good reason NOT to let 44 year olds get married) is
   tha laws are, always have been, and always will be blunt instruments.

   It's very much the same as deciding that we aren't people until we pop
   out of the birth canal.  Laws are good at bright and easily
   identifiable lines, not so good at nuance.

   Perfectly responsible gun buyers should get background checks because
   we don't know they're perfectly responsible and don't have a really
   good way to tell.

   55 year olds -- not to mention infertile men and woment, etc -- are
   allowed to get married because we don't -- and especially in the
   thousands of years that marriage has been around, didn't -- have a good
   way to know who could and could not have children. And -- in the old
   days, people didn't much live to be 55 so it wasn't worth pondering.

   All of which amounts to what, exactly?

   Even if the care of children (and maintenance of lineage) was the
   primary reason for instituting marriage, that doesn't mean that
   marriage is nothing more than that.

   And -- gosh -- last I looked, there were more than a few children of
   gay parents floating about. They might need a little care as well.

     So what if children are the primary reason why marriage exists. They
     are, you know.

   Many years ago I read about some researchers trying to figure out if
   there were ONE reason that every society recognized some form of
   marriage.  I think it was recounted in Sarah Hrdy's book "Mother
   Nature," but I couldn't swear to it.  Anyway, no matter the argument
   for marriage, somewhere, at some time, they could find a society that
   didn't feel that was a reason for marriage.  Yes, in some societies,
   procreation was the primary reason for marriage.  In others, it didn't
   matter if you were married or not for you to procreate.  In some, men
   and women lived together after marriage.  In others, they didn't.  Etc.

   Finally, the researchers were left with only one reason that they could
   find NO exceptions to, and that was that marriage gives you in-laws.
   In other words, it widens your social network.  If the researchers did
   their research right, then the primary reason why marriage exists is to
   give us a wider range of people to exploit for our own survival.

   Of course we all know the argument is idiotic--if we are trying to
   prevent procreation outside of marriage, one partner's fertility would
   be irrelevant if the other partner were not.

   Actually, the truly amazing thing is that at least some of the guys in
   the room didn't seem to get the absurdity of his argument.  (Strom
   Thurmond?  Really?)

   However, his argument could also be shot down by noting that in the
   vast majority of same sex marriages, both parties would most likely be
   fertile?

   Just because the government keeps a record of real property transfers,
   it doesn't mean that the government wants to confiscate your home.

       And, that's a fact.
       The most important legal aspect of marriage -- that which serves
       society -- is the formation of a kinship relationship between two
       people who are not related by blood.
       It's the kinship relationship that allows society and family law to
       function.

   is an assumption of property law's "rule against perpetuities."  I'm
   not going to explain it, and I swear it's not because I can't, though
   it hasn't come up since studying for the bar exam.   It's just that
   other points are more interesting.

   A law banning adultery, which is what Cooper really should be talking
   about, is unconstitutional, which is why he builds his arguments around
   "norms."  But that's irrelevant: nobody's demanding the law require
   anyone to like gay people, but it wouldn't hurt the bigots to do so.

   And I suspect the law presuming that a child born into a marriage is a
   product of it does nothing to deter infidelity.  It lets the "infidel"
   party have the cake and eat it too.  In any event, questions about
   paternity isn't the only reason why the law might want to give
   favorable treatment to (mostly) monogamous couples, with or without
   children.  On balance, marriage seems to make people in marriages
   happy, and the different tax advantages make that easier, not to
   mention clarity around inheritance and health care proxy decisions.

   with 18 months of separation in there somewhere.

   To me, marriage is an agreement between two people to respect the other
   person and guard the intimacy between you.
   Intimacy = security. I'm talking about emotional intimacy and security.
   Monogamy serves to guard the emotional intimacy by keeping it less
   complicated, keeping others out of that arena.
   I've always been one for monogamy, relishing the intimacy of a strong
   relationship.
   But I do understand the idea, as stated in the movie "Breaker Morant",
   that "a slice off a cut loaf is never missed". I get the idea, between
   consenting adults, no harm/no foul.
   I just believe it jeopardizes or weakens the sanctity of that emotional
   bond. It disrupts the maintenance of trust.

   It's all up to one's priorities. In my world, there is nothing I can
   think of that I treasure more than my marriage.

   Speaking of which, it wasn't gay people marrying that caused our
   separation. It was our own neglect of one another. I don't give much
   thought to the physical aspect of SSM. None of my business, as with my
   hetero married friends. I'm not a pervert.
   I like seeing people who love each other together. I like to see the
   outer manifestation of the inner magic. God bless people in love,
   whoever they are, whoever they love.

   I believe in democracy, civil liberties, and the rule of law. That
   makes me a liberal, and I'm proud of it. - Paul Krugman

   There is no argument against gay marriage. That means they have to

   they don't have anything else. I think the real problem is we have a
   Supreme Court that is literally out of touch with reality. They are all
   millionaires deciding the fates of ordinary people they haven't been in
   a long time. It's possible they are using these old arguments because
   they might actually be new to them. Especially someone like Scalia who

 Cooper's argument Straights are irresponsible?? ([778]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [779]Pluto, [780]milton333, [781]kmfmstar

   So if I understand this, gays are not likely to engage in sexual acts
   that could accidentally make someone pregnant.  Straight people are
   likely to make an accidental baby.  Therefore we have to lock up the
   straights in the confines of marriage because otherwise they might
   misbehave.

   Thus it's important to society that straights get married and since gay
   folks are responsible there's no reason society should want them to.

   Now why should society want infertile straights to get married?  The
   answer is that you want straight people to think they should and
   establish a societal norm.

   I guess the next part of his argument is that since straight people
   might not want to get locked up like this society needs to give them
   advantages.  But society doesn't need to pay off gays by giving them
   things like tax breaks and since society would rather not give tax
   breaks to anyone we won't give them to gays.  In fact, if we thought
   straights would be responsible without being married, we could forget
   the whole thing.

   Did I get that right??? Is that really the argument the house is
   making?

   Not because I believe it, but because conservatives are so dull, they
   can't even make their own arguments.

   1. What is the State's interest in marriage? The State does not care if
   the people are in love or are happy. The State only cares about making
   enough people to supply cannon fodder for future wars. Pretend for the
   moment that responsible procreation can only occur in the context of
   marriage.

   2. Therefore the State should support a marriage, only insofar as the
   marriage could, in principle, become a unit of procreation, to supply
   said cannon fodder.

   3. Since people are so variable, we cannot draw sharp lines around
   procreation using age or race, for example. However, because of the way
   sex works, as a biological phenomenon, we can say for sure that only a
   male & a female can procreate. Therefore the state should only
   recognize marriages that involve a male & a female. It's the only way,
   even in principle, we can make future dead soldiers.

   4. As for things like adoption, surrogate motherhood, in vitro
   fertlization, or any of the other myriad ways a couple could
   responsibly come by and raise a child, we can ignore those, because we
   are conservatives, and our small brains can only hold so much.

   How'd I do?

   almost throw up a bit yesterday when Scalia decided to interrupt
   Kagan's questions about infertile couples and joke about Strom
   Thurmond's old-age fertility with a woman more than 40 years his
   junior?

   Aside from being a stupid comment, Thurmond fathered a child - out of
   wedlock, with a 16 year old black girl - in 1925, long before the
   Loving decision.

   So, Scalia's hero Thurmond was a felon under the laws in his state at
   the time.

   Yet even decades later he ran for president with this in his platform:

     We oppose the elimination of segregation, the repeal of
     miscegenation statutes . . .

   And he continued to support segregation and miscegenation laws,
   decrying Loving and other decisions, for decades.

   So it's all well and good for these hypocrites to spout off about
   'marital norms" as long as they themselves don't find it applies to
   them.

   It's okay for him to impregnate a black 15 year old and hide the fact
   for decades while supporting miscegenation laws (and never in a
   committed relationship with her), and it's okay for right wing
   congressmen to sully their own marriages and disrespect their wives in
   publicly embarrassing ways and hate and deny their own gay tendencies,
   but people who want to marry and have stable families are somehow a
   danger to marriage.

   Cheating, prostitutes, closeted gay relationships, wide stances,
   Appalachian Trails, diddling young Congressional pages - yet they fight
   against two people lovingly committing themselves to one another, all
   in the name of preserving "traditional" marriage norms that they
   themselves fail to live up to.

   Stunning.

 Query / military / domicile ([835]0+ / 0-)

   Someone mentioned the problems with trying to transfer a couple from a
   Legal-State to an Ban-State because their rights under DOMA would
   change.

   My recollection is that my brother, who was in the Air Force, decided
   to make Texas his domicile after being stationed there for training. He
   liked their no-income-tax rules. He kept Texas as his domicile as he
   moved from state to state, and then abroad, and then back, until
   retiring.

   How does it work with DOMA?

   What if both the military member of the couple and the spouse were to
   declare that Massachusetts, say, is their domicile?

   I'm just curious about this, because I sincerely hope that the Supreme
   Court will rectify the situation for all, soon.

   say.

   when an infertile woman marries a fertile man his obligation of
   fidelity means he will not be out fathering children with younger,
   fertile women.  thus, the interests of society are served by removing
   from the procreation pool old men and limiting fertile women's choices
   to younger men.

   it was the most sexist comment of the day.

   the shrill won't let me sleep with the young women who would desire me
   in my superior maleness were it not for my fidelity vow.  so marriage
   of a fertile male to an infertile woman limits the choices for those
   silly younger women to pick the right partners to advance the best
   "responsible procreative conduct".  they can't do that without the help
   of marriage with the infertile.

       He's saying that, even if the older man can't procreate with his
       wife, the older woman, it is a legitimate interest of the state to
       take him out of circulation by allowing him to marry that older
       woman.
       Because that way the "societal stigma" against extramarital sex
       will keep our hypothetical Hugh Hefner from knocking up some young
       slut. Thus the state's interest in having children come only in the
       context of a stable married couple's home will be vindicated. The
       gays don't need marriage, see, since their tomcatting will not
       create these babies in unstable homes.
       It's a tortured logic. You could achieve the goal more directly
       simply by criminalizing having children out of wedlock, or checking
       to see if the straight married couple's home actually is stable
       before they're allowed to have kids. Except...wait...all of THAT
       would be unconstitutional. Because it's none of the state's damn

 Norms ([847]0+ / 0-)

   Does government have a legitimate interest in outlawing unions between
   brothers and sisters? If it's only to prevent procreation (e.g., to
   forestall possible possible genetic abnormality in offspring),
   shouldn't we permit such marriages if the females are post-menopausal
   or undergo hysterectomies and/or the men have vasectomies? Or are there
   some "marital norms" that we claim the government may legitimately
   defend, whether or not any given set of partners presents a challenge
   to that interest?

   This is not posted in opposition to gay marriage, merely to point out
   that, IMO, Hunter (or possibly Kagan) is a little hasty in dismissing
   Cooper's basic argument as either irrelevant or stale. If the
   government has no interest in who marries whom, then it's difficult to
   see why other sorts of presently-frowned-upon unions ought not to be
   permitted. Or, if there is some legitimate government interest in these
   matters, there ought to be rational, statable principles and
   guidelines. Simply raising the equality/inequality flag doesn't meet
   that test.
