Higgs boson and Comic Sans: the perfect fusion

   There is outrage on Twitter over Cern's use of Comic Sans on
   presentation slides. But if ever there was an announcement that needed
   to be made in an easy-to-read font, it's this one

   I opened Twitter this morning to find two things trending: "[63]Comic
   Sans", and "[64]Higgs boson" ‚ the former a much-hated font, and the
   latter something to do with science. As unlikely as it sounds, the two
   things were linked. Scientists [65]announcing the discovery of this
   Higgs boson thing had written up their complex findings in the childish
   font [66]everyone loves to hate.

   At first, I thought Twitter had misdiagnosed the font. There are lots
   of scripts out there that look a bit like Comic Sans; I hubristically
   like to think I can tell them apart, and at first glance this one
   looked more like [67]Chalkboard, or [68]Captain Comic. But after
   blowing up a screengrab on Photoshop, 10 minutes of close analysis
   revealed that, yes, this was Comic Sans after all. The awkward serif on
   the capital "c" was a dead giveaway.

   Predictably, Twitter was outraged. "Dear @[69]CERN," [70]wrote one
   science buff with a taste for typography. "Every time you use Comic
   Sans on a powerpoint, God kills the Schr√∂dinger's cat. Please think of
   the cat." [71]Another groaned: "They used Comic Sans on the Higgs boson
   powerpoint presentation ‚¶ Nope there is no hope for mankind."

   This kind of reaction is nothing new. While researching [72]a feature
   about Comic Sans two years ago, I spoke to many people with a visceral
   hatred for the font. According to Holly Combs, a designer who founded
   the [73]Ban Comic Sans movement, using it in most contexts is a bit
   like turning up to a black-tie event in a clown costume. "On a purely
   aesthetic level," says typographer Paul Barnes, who co-designed the
   Guardian's font library, "Comic Sans is not a particularly well-crafted
   letterform."

   In one sense, you can see where its critics are coming from,
   particularly in the context of atomic [74]physics. You could argue that
   it's bizarre to juxtapose inscrutable words like "maximum deviation
   from background-only expectation observed for m ~126 GeV" with a font
   originally designed for a children's computer program.

   But I wouldn't make that argument. If ever there was an announcement
   that needed to be made in Comic Sans, I think it's this one. Comic Sans
   may be over-used, it may look silly, and it may have been designed in a
   hurry. But it's also very legible, and tests have shown that it makes
   complex information easier to understand. There's a reason [75]it's
   used by dyslexia coaches: it facilitates reading.

   We joke about how inscrutable the research at Cern is, so why make it
   seem even more austere? Yes, the Higgs boson is a serious business ‚
   but that's all the more reason to communicate it in as friendly and
   accessible a way as possible.

   Graphic design doesn't have to be elaborate; at its best it
   communicates information quickly and simply. And the chaps at Cern have
   understood that better than most of the font snobs out there.
