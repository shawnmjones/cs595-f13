   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [45]Tagging tips - [46]Search For Tags - [47]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   Are you sure you want to remove this diary from your hotlist?
   Are you sure you want to remove your recommendation? You can only
   recommend a diary once, so you will not be able to re-recommend it
   afterwards.
   Rescue this diary, and add a note:

   Are you sure you want to remove this diary from Rescue?

 Witch Hunts are all these guys have ([129]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [130]Generic Democrat, [131]Heart n Mind, [132]zooecium

   If they didn't keep chasing scandals all the time, people might start
   to notice they really don't have any answers, that they have nothing to
   offer people that will make their lives better. They don't believe in
   government, can't make it work, don't care if it works or not. But, boy
   can they crank up distractions and freak shows!

   They want power without responsibility, wealth without effort. Actions
   without consequences. But when the bill comes due, a witch hunt is a
   good way to give people a scapegoat to blame for it all.
