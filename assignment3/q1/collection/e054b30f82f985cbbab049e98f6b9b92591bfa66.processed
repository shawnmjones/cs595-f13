   [30]Leonard Pitts provides a reminder about gun violence well-suited
   for Easter morning.

     In the King James Bible, in the book of Matthew, the rabbi -- Jesus
     -- is quoted as saying, "Suffer little children and forbid them not,
     to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven."

     When I was a kid, that always confused me. I wondered why children
     were commanded to suffer. But, as later translations confirm, the
     word was used in its old English sense, meaning: to permit or allow.
     Let the children come to me, He is saying, for they are the essence
     of grace. Love the children.

     Two thousand years later, a singer named Marvin Gaye turned that
     command into a stark plea: Save the children.

     As a nation, as a people, we have failed at both.

     Nearly 100,000 people will be shot this year according to the Brady
     Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Seventeen thousand will be younger
     than 19. So almost 5,000 kids have been shot since the Newtown
     massacre in December, the one that was supposed make us finally get
     serious about gun violence.

   More punditry behind door number only...

   A big chunk of the New York Times editorial page is given over to
   conservative fiscal fantasy -- fantasy in which all our current
   problems are the results of that damned FDR and his henchmen, toddies,
   lickspittles, and minions. If there was a paragraph worth pulling from
   it, I'd do so... But there's not.  It's not just bad economics and
   revisionist history, it's boring.

   [31]Ross Douthat says that conservatives were right to be worried about
   gay marriage.

     Since Frum warned that gay marriage could advance only at
     traditional wedlock's expense, the marriage rate has been falling
     faster, the out-of-wedlock birthrate has been rising faster, and the
     substitution of cohabitation for marriage has markedly increased.
     Underlying these trends is a steady shift in values: Americans are
     less likely to see children as important to marriage and less likely
     to see marriage as important to childbearing (the generation gap on
     gay marriage shows up on unwed parenting as well) than even in the
     very recent past.

   See, gay people, your marriage is so bad, it caused time traveling
   robots to go back and preemptively kill non-gay marriage. Douthat may
   be wildly illogical, but at least his arm waving won't substitute for
   Nytol.

   [32]Maureen Dowd mulls one twisty bit at the center of the arguments in
   the Supreme Court.

     Gays might not win because they've already won?

     That was the moronic oxymoron at the heart of the Supreme Court
     debate on same-sex marriage. ...

     On Wednesday, Chief Justice John Roberts played Karl Rove, musing
     not about moral imperatives but political momentum.

     "You don't doubt that the lobby supporting the enactment of same-sex
     marriage laws in different states is politically powerful, do you?"
     he asked Roberta Kaplan, the New York lawyer representing Edie
     Windsor, the captivating 83-year-old who argued that she would not
     have been socked with a whopping estate tax bill if her spouse had
     been named Theo instead of Thea.

   Note to C.J. Roberts: it's not as if politics around the issue of gay
   marriage is a new thing. The GOP has been using the issue to drag
   voters to the polls for years. Decades. That never seemed to bother
   you. What's upsetting you is that it's become a losing issue for the
   right.

   [33]Matthew Hutson looks at the conflict between doing what's right,
   and doing the right thing.

     Moral quandaries often pit concerns about principles against
     concerns about practical consequences. Should we ban assault rifles
     and large sodas, restricting people's liberties for the sake of
     physical health and safety? Should we allow drone killings or
     torture, if violating one person's rights could save a thousand
     lives?

     We like to believe that the principled side of the equation is
     rooted in deep, reasoned conviction. But a growing wealth of
     research shows that those values often prove to be finicky,
     inconsistent intuitions, swayed by ethically irrelevant factors.
     What you say now you might disagree with in five minutes. And such
     wavering has implications for both public policy and our personal
     lives.

   It's a fairly short piece, and probably nothing you haven't heard
   before, but it's worth reading just as a reminder of how few decisions
   are really clear cut.

   [34]David Leonhardt explores a very simple idea for getting more poor
   kids into college -- give them more information about colleges.

     Among a control group of low-income students with SAT scores good
     enough to attend top colleges -- but who did not receive the
     information packets -- only 30 percent gained admission to a college
     matching their academic qualifications. Among a similar group of
     students who did receive a packet, 54 percent gained admission,
     according to the researchers, Caroline M. Hoxby of Stanford and
     Sarah E. Turner of the University of Virginia.

   [35]Charlotte Childress and Harriet Childress look at another factor
   that correlates with mass shootings. It's not just particular rifles or
   large ammo magazines. It's race.

     Imagine if African American men and boys were committing mass
     shootings month after month, year after year. Articles and
     interviews would flood the media, and we'd have political debates
     demanding that African Americans be "held accountable." Then, if an
     atrocity such as the Newtown, Conn., shootings took place and
     African American male leaders held a news conference to offer
     solutions, their credibility would be questionable. The public would
     tell these leaders that they need to focus on problems in their own
     culture and communities.

     But when the criminals and leaders are white men, race and gender
     become the elephant in the room. ...

     When white men try to divert attention from gun control by talking
     about mental health issues, many people buy into the idea that the
     United States has a national mental health problem, or flawed
     systems with which to address those problems, and they think that is
     what produces mass shootings.

     But women and girls with mental health issues are not picking up
     semiautomatic weapons and shooting schoolchildren. Immigrants with
     mental health issues are not committing mass shootings in malls and
     movie theaters. Latinos with mental health issues are not
     continually killing groups of strangers.

   This is your "boy, do parts of this make me uncomfortable, but..." Read
   It All pick of the morning.

   [36]Dana Milbank declares gun reform season closed.

     "Don't get squishy," President Obama told members of Congress.

     But they already have.

     "Now is the time," the president said.

     But the time was actually three months ago. ...

     There is no pleasure in I-told-you-sos on such a wrenching issue,
     but failure of the gun proposals was easy to predict. Three days
     after the Newtown shooting, when Obama was talking about action in
     "the coming weeks," I argued against the White House's slow walk:
     "In the case of gun control, a pattern has become persistent: A
     tragedy sparks an outcry for common-sense gun laws and gun groups
     are set back on their heels, but by the time Congress gets around to
     taking action, the National Rifle Association has regained its
     legislative stranglehold."

   So, move along nation. Nothing more to see here. We'll just have to
   wait for the next senseless massacre. Or maybe the one after that. And
   remember: it's Obama's fault congress hasn't passed anything.

   [37]Doyle McManus looks at the likely outcome from the week's wrangling
   at the Supreme Court.

     If the Supreme Court decides the two gay marriage cases it heard
     last week the way most court watchers believe it will, expect legal
     and political chaos.

     The court seems ready to strike down the federal Defense of Marriage
     Act, while ruling quite narrowly on California's Proposition 8,
     allowing a lower-court decision to stand. Such an outcome would make
     gay marriage legal in California without deciding whether state bans
     on same-sex marriage are constitutional. ...

     This kind of legal patchwork virtually guarantees that politicians
     in states that don't recognize gay marriage will be debating and
     legislating the issue for years, making for an even more confusing
     situation. The ensuing chaos could harm more than just gay couples;
     the Republican Party stands to lose too.

   There are a lot of cases where I'd cheer an outcome damaging to the
   GOP. This isn't one of them. Against all odds, I wish the Roberts court
   would show some damn backbone and stop trying to weasel out of its
   responsibility to uphold justice.

   [38]Michael Slezak says you might want to check the manufacturer's
   label on those fairy circles.

     It seems the culprit behind the mysterious "fairy circles" of the
     Namib desert has been under our noses all along.

     The fairy circles are discs of barren sand several metres across,
     surrounded by lush grasses that stand out against the sparse
     vegetation. Since the 1960s, theories about their origin have been
     raised and quickly shot down. A study in 2004 seemed to rule out the
     three leading theories: radioactive soil, toxic debris left by
     plants, and termites.

   Hint: one of these things just got ruled back in.

   In a break with the normal layout for this column, I want to close out
   by going back to the Leonard Pitts piece at the top of the stack.

     This year as every year, foes of abortion publicly mourn the loss of
     babies who could have been. But they -- we -- remain silent on the
     loss of babies who actually were, who died because we could not get
     our act together, because ours is a nation that does not simply
     enable private gun ownership, but that worships and fetishizes it to
     the point where sensible restriction -- even sensible conversation
     -- seems impossible.

     As a result, we are a nation where what happened to Jonylah and
     Antonio has become grimly, sadly . . . routine. That fact alone
     starkly illustrates the insanity to which we have devolved, and the
     challenge that faces faith this Easter week.

   If you haven't read the rest of this column, now would be a good time.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health

   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Working long and hard with a single mindset ([165]17+ / 0-)

       is exactly what proponents of gun safety will have to do to counter
       the single-minded purpose of those who oppose any gun restriction
       or regulation at all.  When you find yourself in a political
       conversation with one of these people, it becomes quickly apparent
       that keeping the government from any regulation of firearms is the
       only political subject they really care about - and they are both
       extreme and adamant in their beliefs.

 In a nutshell OUR problem with lots of issues. ([186]4+ / 0-)

                [190]PsychoSavannah

       On issue after issue it appears to me, after some fifty plus years
       of adult observation, that this is the nub of the "progressive" or
       "liberal" or just modern big tent Democrat problem. I think my
       personal observation has some backing in scientific and polling
       evidence, but I won't try to quote any--just suggest we all think
       about it.
       I've had neighbors, coworkers, acquaintances and others I've
       observed closely and one thing has stood out in those that have
       been modern Republicans since at least the Regan years and all
       those we would class as "the right" since I first knew some. Unlike
       "my kind of people"they do not have wide ranging interests and they
       tend to "religiously" focus on some simple dogmas. Just as a
       fundamentalist Christian believing every word of the Bible was
       written by the finger of god confronted with paradoxes or flat out
       contradictions they retreat to "faith" in their authority.
       Right now I have neighbors who have two points of focus outside
       their immediate family: church and anti-abortion/gay/"liberal"
       causes. Some have cars filled with "pro life" and GOP bumper
       stickers and little fish with crosses for eyes. In casual
       conversation they tell me of hours spent on the computer
       "organizing" and communicating with their like minded circle and
       organizations. They vote every election and there is never a
       question of how they will vote.
       I find the people I find more attractive for association much less
       single minded and, distressingly to me, less likely to have a
       strategic view of elections. If they get hyped about some
       candidate, usually presidential, they will vote. On other election
       days I ask and it is "too busy" or "they are all alike" or some
       other excuse. I'm old fashioned, remembering my civics teachers
       focus on the importance of voting in every election, even if it is
       just for a small town council seat.
       That is what brings about change and that is how we keep the toilet
       flushed when there is a particularly bad smell to a
       politician--even when the opponent isn't much better.
       The only foes that threaten America are the enemies at home, and
       those are ignorance, superstition, and incompetence. [Elbert

   Surprised this one hasn't appeared yet:

   "This guy obviously isn't a real hunter or sport shooter, I have
   1,000's of rounds of ammo at the ready".

   You're just not a credible hunter unless when you and your buddies go
   hunting it sounds like a big battle between the Hatfields and the
   McCoys, with hundreds of rounds fired.

   "Odd" that when I come across one of the hunting shows on TV, the
   featured hunter is very quiet, and typically drops the deer or elk with
   one shot.

   If you need 10-20 shots to get your intended prey, I can only conclude
   you're not a very good shot... and you need more time at the target
   range.

       If you're a naturally good shot and a naturally very mindful gun
       user, you don't need tons of practice to shoot well and know where
       to point the weapon and how not to shoot yourself or someone else.
       Maybe he's stretching it.
       You're doing a good job of distracting from the point he's making,
       which resonates around the country among many gun owners.
       Newtown was a horror, an outrage, that was facilitated, perpetrated
       by the makers of high capacity magazines and assault weapons who
       hijacked the NRA (they dominate the board)  and who have a
       stranglehold on our political process.
       Now there are numerous efforts on several fronts to distract and
       delay and distort the effort towards common sense.
       One is to persecute the "mentally ill" as scapegoats for this

       What's disturbing is that he's tacitly advocating inexperience.
       Praying for superhuman kinesthesia is not sound policy, and I'm
       surprised to see so many people who (I assume) would support
       stronger training requirements for lawful gun owners insist that
       expending a mere four rounds a year is anything but keeping
       irresponsibly out of practice.
       Manufacturers of detachable magazines and black guns had nothing to
       do with 12/14.  It is a line pushed either out of ignorance of
       vindictiveness.  And I do not delay or distract.  A lot of work

       people.  It's frustrating to see so much time and effort wasted on

       Short answer, we were.
       Long answer.  There's been a steady stream of massacres for thirty
       years now, averaging twenty a year.  As horrifying as they are,
       they are a drop of water in the ocean compared to flood of gun
       violence that claims less victims per incident.  Thankfully, that
       toll has diminished considerably since the 1990s.  In that vein,
       the focus has been on prevention and law enforcement response.
       Project Exile garnered cross-spectrum support from the Brady
       Campaign and the NRA.  Gun rights activists naturally focus on the
       community aspect of community policing, particularly where it
       concerns self-defense.  In the 1990s, the NRA implemented the
       seminar series "Refuse to Be A Victim" and made it available to law
       enforcement community policing initiataives across the country.
       These efforts haven't been without missteps.  The NRA and Brady are
       both complicit in the "war on crime" that focused on a broad brush,
       heavy handed, incarceration-centric approach to dealing with even
       technical infractions.  And neither campaign has spoken on the
       issues regarding, say, stop and frisk in New York as opposed to
       more effective measures such as focused deterrence.  Part of this
       can be forgiven noting that neither organization is principally
       concerned with crime control and both are only peripherally
       connected with law enforcement.

       disagree with you.  I have taken 160 class deer, Elk, Bear and
       various varmints.  And except for when I was learning to shoot
       (because I didn't grow up doing it and learned as an adult) I know
       I haven't shot that many rounds.  The point of hunting, even trophy
       hunting, is not to simply slaughter the animal.  One well placed
       shot is considered good hunting.  Since responsible hunters also
       follow game laws you are not going to be hunting 40 animals a year
       since there are limits.  So I have to completely disagree with you.
        If you are a hunter and shoot 154 rounds in a year you are just a
       terrible shot.  And you probably should take up another hobby.

       I question whether they are serious hunters, then.  It's four
       rounds a year, not 154.  Dewitt claimed he'd never shot more than
       154 rounds in his entire life.
       BTW, if you aren't shooting more than 150 rounds in a year, I
       suggest you get down to the range or find another hobby.  Overly
       casual gun ownership is a threat both to public safety and to the
       right to keep and bear arms.

     Overly casual gun ownership is a threat both to public safety and to
     the right to keep and bear arms.
       Agreed. Further, I believe gun owners who leave their loaded
       handguns lying around the house where their kids can get them and
       either shoot a family member or neighbor kid dead (happens dozens
       of times per year) are casual/irresponsible gun owners.
       They are obviously a threat to public safety; the criminal/civil
       penalties for these sort of absurd deaths should be much heavier
       than they are now. However, thanks to the NRA, there's barely (if
       ANY) penalty.

       You're sounding more and more like an uninformed gun owner.
       Years ago when I lived in Indianapolis and paid a lot of attention
       to state politics, many in the state legislature there got fed up
       with the numerous cases of six year old Billy getting ahold of his
       dad's loaded handgun (casually left lying around the house) and
       shooting five year old neighbor Tommy dead.
       Indiana legislators started the process to pass legislation which
       would stiffen the criminal penalty for these absurd, irresponsible
       gun owners.
       The NRA got wind of this effort, came in and spread some bribes,
       errr I mean "campaign contributions" around the legislature-- and
       that was the END of that legislative effort. I think it's a safe
       bet this same pathetic scenario has been repeated in several
       states.
       I hope you're not implying the NRA doesn't constantly work to stop
       this and other legislative efforts-- that would be about as bogus
       as it gets

       Well, let's just say that I am an "uninformed gun owner."  Educate
       me.  I honestly have no idea what bills and debates you're talking
       about.  I never lived in Indiana, so I'd be very interested in some
       verifiable details about the legislation you referenced.
       By the way, I oppose the NY SAFE Act as well.

   having them would say shooting less than 150 rounds a year equates
   overly casual gun ownership.  If you can shoot at 300 yards and hit
   what you are shooting at in one shot why do you need to shoot 150
   rounds.  People who hunt don't have arsenals that they need to keep up
   to date.  Sure if you have a problem getting a gun sighted in you might
   need to shoot more.  But the act of going to the range and shooting so
   you can just enjoy the act of shooting doesn't make you safe with guns.
    Knowing gun safety, respecting the weapon and following rules makes
   you safe with guns.  I have plenty of experience with very experienced
   hunters.  Excellent shots.  Ones who have been on military teams.  Men
   and women who have grown up with weapons and teach weapon safety to
   others.  And it is simply wrong to say that you have to shoot your guns
   a lot to be safe with them.  You can make the point that you might need
   your guns for when the government comes to take you away.  Or maybe you
   need them for the hordes you expect to invade your home.  Or maybe you
   just like to shoot a lot.  But you do not have to shoot a lot to hunt
   and you do not have to shoot a lot to be safe.

 Well since this is the internet you aren't ([499]0+ / 0-)
       required to believe me.  (A 160 class deer vs. spike a  is much
       more related to the areas that you hunt than it is to skill)  You
       and your friends may have to practice a lot at 300 yards but I
       haven't missed yet.  Nor taken more than one shot.  All of this
       glorification of guns makes it sound like it's something special.
       With a proper scope it isn't hard to hit game at 300 yards.  Most
       of the hunters I know can do it.  The ones who can't haven't spent
       any time at all working on it.  And usually haven't even made sure
       their rifle is properly sighted in.  It certainly doesn't take 30
       rounds, or 50 or 154.  And it certainly doesn't take days and days
       at the range.  Obviously you have to learn to shoot and that takes
       some time.  The best shot I know can pick his rifle up after months
       of non-use and literally shoot a bird out of the sky.  And he's 80
       years old.  His son is a better shot.  They love guns and love to
       hunt.  But they scoff at people who think they "need" to be able to
       shoot off 150+ rounds in minutes.  When it comes to home protection
       they know their shotguns work just as well, if not better than
       military style guns. They don't think you shouldn't be able to have
       those guns.  They just think it's silly.

   Four rounds.  A year.  Apparently this guy doesn't need to sight-in or
   get any practice at all.  Or maybe he's the type to break out the rifle
   and fire a few of rounds aimlessly in the woods once or twice a year.

   This is all but proof you're just trolling the thread with illogical

   be to appear, disrupt, argue, alienate, and shut down any responsible
   discussion.  Practically the plain definition of a troll.

   The following comment, following asking for a link about an 85 yo man
   who is Bob's father and the expectation that he should be online, is
   just absurd.

   My own father, brothers, uncles and myself would often hunt.  We'd go
   out with 12 ga shotguns and one box of shells. More often than not,
   we'd bring back a half dozen quail or pheasants between us and half the
   box of shells too.

   Your insane calculus that "real" hunters blast through hundreds of
   rounds of ammo per year "practicing hunting" is just way off base to
   the prairie reality of people who lived (and many still do) frugally,
   based upon skill and not wasteful expenditures of funds on ammo.

   You've made a fool of yourself with that "Link" question and a rude
   fool of yourself with the "Thought so" followup.

   By the way, I'm not a lifelong hunter.  Neither was my father.  Or my
   grandparents, for all I know.  Been hunting for all of six years now.
   But it seems that everyone on DK and their pet duck who makes the
   extreme ammunition thrift argument for sportsmanship either grew up
   hunting or was raised by someone who fed the family with game from
   right outside.  But this is the first time people have argued that 4
   rounds a year (or a dozen rounds a year) is adequate and normal.

       I'm pretty sure he was exaggerating.  Just not sure which direction
       the truth lies.  It is possible that he's counting only shots for
       specific game; I've racked up several times as many in six years,
       but then again I also hunt varmint.

       and I'd hazard that I've gone through a good deal less. Maybe 100
       shots -- off the range.  I've certainly tested the patterns on an
       old adjustable choke 12 gauge inherited from a cousin.  I've
       plinked a lot of targets getting practice with a .22.  I've earned
       my marksmanship badge knocking down targets with a Remington .22.
       I've missed an awful lot of skeet.
       I don't think the larger caliber handguns or rifles at my house
       have been fired in twenty years. In fact, I'm sure of it.
       I've fired my grandfather's Marlin 1898 at game exactly twenty
       times. And I've hit game, exactly twenty times. Which is why I'll
       probably keep the old girl up on the wall from now on. You hate to
       ruin record like that.
       When I was a kid, squirrel, rabbit, and quail made up a fair
       portion of what was on my plate, but that hasn't been true for
       probably thirty years. As for big game, I've shot exactly one (1)
       deer.  That was when I was 14 (I think).  A rifled slug out of that
       same old Marlin.  I've not had an inclination to do so again.
       These days, a hunt is really more of an excuse to stroll around
       with a shotgun couched under my arm, enjoying an reason to get my
       boots muddy. If someone has a dog along, all the better. 9 times
       out of 10, I probably don't shoot at anything. I cheer for other
       folks' shots and trot out stories of the time I got a double at
       quail, or recall laying back in a wood to shoot squirrels on a
       frosty morning. Or waded nee deep snow following beagles trying to
       roust a few rabbits out of thickets. Last year I didn't shoot a
       thing, not even a piece of paper.
       And I still call myself a hunter.
       If the fellow in question had never fired more than 150 shots off
       the range, I'd believe that easily enough. And I'd believed he
       enjoyed himself and got as much out of his time hunting as folks
       who've fired twenty times as often.

       In which case, I wouldn't call him a "lifelong" hunter except in

       So the question is does he mean off the range or not?

       But the more you talk the less you seem to know about hunting.
       Many people don't hunt every year.  And it sounds like you think
       hunters can hunt every day of the year.  In fact, in many areas
       hunting season is limited to just a few weeks in the entire year.
       One bout of the flu or bad cold, one important life event, one busy
       work schedule has knocked many hunters out of hunting for a year.
       Again, I think you have some idealized vision of hunting.  Maybe
       that's why you want verification from a "real life" TV hunter or
       something.

       On the contrary, the more Jerry talks the less he seems to know
       about hunting, or shooting.  I admit that I'm pretty new to
       hunting; but it strikes me as odd that someone who'd describe
       themselves as a "lifelong hunter" has yet to fire 154 rounds in his
       adult life.
       The whole thing feels like blatant exaggeration aimed at bolstering
       otherwise unimpressive credentials.

   They are long time members of Ducks Unlimited-- a wetlands conservation

   There's a lot to be said for simply being out in nature, going for a

   this, which is why a natural benefit/by product of hunting is

       drag hunters into their gun fantasy world because at least hunting
       is a recognized use for guns.  While people differ on whether or
       not it is a legitimate pastime it is at least a use of guns that
       people accept as OK--if they think hunting is OK.  The problem for
       guys that love guns but who don't have any legitimate use for them
       except their nebulous need "when the shit hits the fan"  is they
       want to super-impose their gun fetish on hunters.  So you get this
       kind of absolute insistence that hunters must really need all that
       ammunition and that many guns and that much target practice.  And
       if you trace this thread all of the way back to the original post
       that they objected to -- high capacity magazines.  But they don't.
        Because "gun having" is not what hunters are all about.

 I have a couple of friends who hunt birds ([899]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [900]Avila

   Upland and wetland fowl. For them, it's more about a day outside
   tromping around with the dogs than getting a shot off, though they
   usually bring in something and either eat it or freeze and refreeze it
   over and over, using it to train dogs. Their freezer is full of dead
   birds. I've eaten duck, goose, and pheasant that they've brought down.
   They also bred and trained my retrievers.

   I don't hunt. I can't hit a skeet pigeon to save my life and I'm not
   about to aim at a live bird until I can take down the clay ones well. I
   do have a handgun for protection here at home. It has never been shot
   except at a range, and then only at square, diamond, oval, or round
   targets, never anything else. Shots I've made for practice at a range:
   plenty, because I expect tight groupings from myself. Shots I've fired
   with a borrowed shotgun at the skeet range: less than a hundred, and I
   can't hit worth a damn. If I want to go bird hunting with my friends,
   or run a dog in a UKC hunt test, I need to do a lot better than that;
   my dog will get penalized in the hunt test if I can't shoot well. Shots
   I have fired off a range: exactly none.

   I will admit I'd like to get a good quality shotgun, and I'd like to
   learn to shoot well with it. Then my dream of running my dog(s) in both
   field and show can be real. Until then, I'll shoot at things like clay
   pigeons and paper targets shaped like blocks, things that can't be hurt
   if I miss.

   My desire is to never, ever have to shoot a human being, but as I have
   already in my life been raped and beaten in my home by a guy who left,
   then tried to break back in and kill me (and stalked me daily for the
   seven months leading up to the hearing), feeling like I need a way to
   protect myself in my home isn't the result of a paranoid fantasy but a
   lived reality.

 I think you should do the math. ([950]0+ / 0-)

   Junior high is about 13-15 years old, so this guy would have been
   hunting for more than 40 years.  Maybe 45.

   Let's take the low -range --

   154/40 = 3.9 rounds per year.

   Three or Four shots a year.

   Presumably he would have taken some safety traing (I hope), done some
   target practice, and actually taken a few shots at things here and
   there.  If he were really out in Texas and Colorado shooting at things
   like rabbits and pheasants, I can guarantee he missed now and them.

   I suspect that the guy really is a hunter,  but hasn't actually done
   the math to realize how the rounds add up over a lifetime.

   As to 154 shots in 5 minutes, I'm curious about where that came from.
   Not the shots, but the timing.  The reports are of the nature "less
   than 5 minutes, investigators believe", so the real timing is up in the
   air.

   That's a shot every other second, which is a whole bunch of shooting in
   a short time.  Not quite amazing -- you can even fire an old fashioned
   police revolver much more quickly than that.  It's the reloading that
   will get you.  He had 30 round magazines, and that means just 4-5
   reloads (depending on how full the magazines were)

   the ninja/Government fearers draw us into their battle for large

   take pride in fewer shots.  While I think the man whose twitter Rachel
   posted was probably talking about "real" shots-meaning shots when he
   was trying to shoot something, his point is well taken.  True hunters
   don't automatically fall into the catagory of people who have guns
   because they just love guns.  I rarely see a hunter brag about his gun.
    More likely to see him/her brag about the shot they made. Singular
   shot-not plural.

   I love Rachel on most topics, but when it comes to guns, and
   particularly high-capacity magazines, she comes across as "push this
   talking point at all costs".

   On Newtown, long, repetitious discussions about how if Lanza had needed
   to reload more times, that the death toll would not have been as high.
   Ergo, a reason to ban high-capacity magazines.

   Then, when it turns out Lanza did "tactical reloads", removing
   non-empty clips and replacing them with full clips (meaning that he was
   not using the full capacity of his magazines). So, it turns out he was
   reloading more? Another long, repetitious discussion about how this is
   a reason to ban high-capacity magazines.

   Similarly, it's "universal background checks" any time any story
   involves guns. And then, she brings up the straw purchase for the
   shooting of the Colorado corrections chief, which a universal
   background check would not have prevented, which is apparently...a
   reason for universal background checks.

   Compare to a Republican talking point to see the logic involved, where
   any situation is somehow support for the agenda being pushed.

   The economy is down? - We need to lower taxes!
   The economy is up? - We need to lower taxes!

   As far as the Jerry Dewitt thing goes, I'll concur with a few other
   people here. I've put more than 154 rounds through each gun I own, and
   none of them are "assault weapons". Dewitt is like someone claiming
   they're a good driver because they've only driven 154 miles in 58 years
   and wondering why anyone would ever need a car with more than a 1
   gallon gas tank.

   Simply because all the other clueless non-drivers out there might think
   this is amazing wisdom and tweet it to all their friends does not make

       CT will ban AWB and high capacity magazines. People do not need to

       The bill will be introduced Mon and voted Wed, most likely.
       [1099]http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/...

     After reviewing "chilling" details from the Newtown shooting
     investigation, legislative leaders from both parties plan to meet in
     private with rank-and-file lawmakers Monday to discuss negotiated
     gun control legislation. A vote on a bill is expected as early as
     Wednesday.

     The movement toward a vote came Thursday after prosecutors released
     search warrants for the ongoing investigation into the Dec. 14
     murder of 20 first graders and six educators at an elementary school
     in Newtown.
     Legislative leaders have been working for weeks to negotiate a
     bipartisan bill in response to the shooting and have requested as
     much information as possible to inform their legislation. Leaders
     from both parties say they plan to meet with members on Monday.

     Both McKinney, who represents Newtown, and Williams have advocated
     for a ban on the possession of high-capacity magazines.

     "There are first grade parents in Newtown whose kids were able to
     flee that school who believe their kids lives very well may have
     been spared because of the changing of magazines and the time it
     took to reload," McKinney said.
       The bipartisan bill will incude AWB and HCM bans because people are
       convinced it would have saved lives here and will elsewhere.
       You don't have to like it.

       I don't doubt it.  In fact, I believe CT could probably get away
       without grandfathering.  On the other hand, grandfathering makes
       the law even more difficult to enforce.  And eventually, 3D
       printing magazines and lower pressure components will make even
       that a dead letter.  At some point, we may even see a fight over an
       attempt to ban centerfire ammunition, period.

       experience.  And over the past decade, the trend has been towards
       ownership liberalization, particularly where it concerns the

       It is worth noting that the remarkable drop in the CA numbers
       started in the 1993-1994 interval, while the timetable of
       California laws is:
       1989: CA Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Act (requiring registration
       by 1991)
       1994: Federal Assault Weapon Ban (by which time the CA law had
       already been in effect for some years)
       1994: Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act
       As best I can tell, there are no major California or Federal gun
       control laws that were enacted that would cause the dramatic drop
       starting in 1993, plus it undercuts the statements on both sides of
       the issue that the original assault weapon ban was toothless and
       had so many loopholes as to not make any difference. Or, it might
       be something simple like the graph being off by a year and the
       decline listed as being from 1993 to 1994 is actually supposed to
       be from 1994 to 1995, during which the two new federal laws would
       have been in force.
       Since the graph lists all firearms deaths, perhaps it would be more
       instructive to see a graph for firearms suicides for the period
       shown, side-by-side with one for firearms homicides.
       Not trying to diffuse or redirect the issue, but it seems that as
       presented, there are factors other than gun control laws at work
       here.

       But that does not explain the synchronicity between California and
       national numbers. If the CA drop is a delayed reaction to
       Roberti-Roos, then the national numbers should lag behind the
       federal ban. Instead we see a sharp CA drop at the same time as a
       lesser drop at the national level, and both of them level off at
       about the same time as well. And we do not see a corresponding rise
       in the national level after the expiration of the federal ban.
       To be fair, reduced availability for a generation of young adults
       (the most violent cohort) could simply have convinced them that
       they did not need to own guns. If so, this is a demographic bubble
       that should be trackable using available crime data and is worth
       exploring. Similarly, since there has always been a racial aspect
       to gun control, seeing if there were any race-based changes in
       arrest/incarceration rates in this period would be interesting.
       It is worth investigating if there were any other laws or major
       social changes outside of firearm or firearm type law that happened
       about the same time as the drop. Because I think we are missing
       something useful here. Just don't know what it is yet.

     purchases by persons who have committed violent misdemeanors. Yet
     some 600,000 firearms were sold there in 2011, and the firearms

   my advice is spend more time discussing safety and not complaining
   about what other people are doing about safety.

   The UBC are [1211]very solid.

     We should start by requiring background checks for all firearm
     purchases. When a licensed retailer -- gun dealer or pawnbroker --
     sells a firearm, a background check is performed and a permanent
     record is kept. But perhaps 40% of all firearms transactions involve
     private-party sellers, who need not keep records and cannot obtain a
     background check. I have observed hundreds of these anonymous,
     undocumented sales; they can be completed in less than a minute.

     Not surprisingly, private-party sales are the most important source
     of firearms for criminal buyers and specifically for persons
     prohibited by law from purchasing firearms. Such buyers do not
     volunteer their stories, and savvy sellers know not to ask.
     Private-party sales are also probably the main reason that the Brady
     Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which requires background checks
     for sales by licensed retailers, did not reduce firearm-related
     homicides.1

     Second, on at least two fronts, we should broaden our criteria for
     denying someone the purchase or possession of firearms.

   Good suggestions always welcome. RKBA folks talking about how ignorant
   the nonRKBA folks are? Not so much. The Sandy hook parents have
   standing in this as do Newtown residents and physicians and others who
   have to pick up the pieces.

   never forget that before you post ;-)

 More than one way to discuss safety ([1215]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [1216]Greg Dworkin

       Pointing out flawed arguments and rhetorical tactics that we
       rightly mock when Republicans do it may not in and of itself be a
       productive safety suggestion, but I do think it is appropriate,
       unless you want the point you are trying to make to be framed as
       "it's only valid when our side is the one doing it."
       Witness the absolute blindness of some people on the Dewitt
       comment. Despite the text saying that the person very specifically
       had fired less than 154 rounds in their lifetime, how many
       commenters read that as "Dewitt had never fired 154 rounds in a 5
       minute period in his lifetime".
       And when this is pointed out to people, they HR the person pointing
       it out to them. Multiple times.
       That is pretty much the definition of an irrational bias, and I
       think it is a perfectly good idea to highlight this rather than
       defend it. On a different issue, would you be criticizing me for
       talking about Todd Akin's level of knowledge (or lack thereof) of
       female physiology? Probably not. I would hope you would instead be
       calling for people to be better informed and educated on the issue.
       After all, I am sure that you have learned quite a bit since you
       started, and this knowledge has improved the quality and depth of
       your observations on the issue. Correct?
       An idiot on one side of an issue makes that side look as bad as an
       idiot on the other side does. You don't see me defending Wayne
       LaPierre and Ted Nugent, do you?
       On the NEJM piece, not sure what to make of it, except that we can
       play duelling experts all day long. After all, the recent Johns
       Hopkins white paper on the subject concluded that the beneficial
       effects of a high-capacity magazine ban would be so small as to
       fall into the statistical noise, yet I doubt I will see you quoting
       that Johns Hopkins study more than you will quote the NEJM letter
       to the editor.
       That too is its own form of bias. One which I can completely
       understand, given where you are standing, but it is bias
       nonetheless. For instance, take the following sentences:
       1) circumstance X is related to the transmission of disease Y
       2) circumstance X can be reduced by doing Z
       3) doing Z has no measureable effect on the transmission rate of
       disease Y
       As a doctor, how much sense does this make to you? Because that is
       the material you quoted above and gave full credibility.
       1) illegal gun transfers are related to firearms homicides
       2) retailer background checks reduce illegal gun transfers
       3) retailer background checks have no effect on firearm-related
       homicides
       That is not the logic I would use if trying to make a case for a
       more stringent application of Z.
       Just because you (or I) support a particular position, it does not
       mean we should apply a less rigorous level of scrutiny to that
       position. In terms of a UBC, we probably agree on most of it and
       differ merely on details and implementation, but that does not mean
       either of us should automatically assume that "we agree" means
       "we're right".

       As far as your faulty analogy goes, I can tell you

       experts there.
       2. the tricky questions are
        a. gun ownership (itself a risk)? debatable but not wrong or right
        b. awb and high capacity magazine bans - debatable but not wrong
       or right
       You picked the wrong fight about your syllogism analogy. here's how
       it actually works with public health: you see deaths, you collect
       the best data possible, you act before you reach perfection of the
       data [1224]in order to save lives.

     Rachel Weintraub, director of product safety at the Consumer
     Federation of America, said the Buckyballs campaign was simply an
     effort to shift the focus away from safety. "The essence here is
     safety, that children are being injured in horrendous ways," she
     said. "It is classic industry strategy: changing the subject,
     attacking the messenger."

     Mr. Zucker prefers to cast the issue as one of fairness. "This is an
     issue about when can consumers make a decision to buy an adult
     product?" he said. "It's a good fight. And it's a fight I think we
     can win."
       He lost.
       Arguing to "not do something" because the "data is not perfect" is
       sophistry, an intent to obscure and delay. Not saying that's what
       you are doing but your analogy has certainly been used for that
       purpose.

 Actually, different study ([1234]0+ / 0-)
       I never said I disagreed with you on background checks, just saying
       that the very material you quoted as an argument in favor of
       background checks was a really poor argument to support it. Saying
       "what we propose to do has had no effect, so we should do it even
       more" is not going to convince people who are trying to make their
       mind up on the issue.
       On the Buckyballs, we had this discussion earlier and I consider it
       notable that you never replied to my comment that only one brand of
       that item was banned. The exact same item can be bought in bulk
       elsewhere completely legally. Again, that makes it a very poor
       argument if you translate it into gun control terms ("we're going
       to ban exactly one model of assault rifle and exactly one brand of
       high-capacity magazine").
       For Johns Hopkins, I was referring to [1235]this paper from the
       Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy Research, with the following
       quote regarding a high-capacity magazine ban:

     Even if the ban eventually prevented only 1 of every 5 of the five
     percent of incidents in which large capacity magazines are relevant,
     that would translate into about 100 fewer homicides and 500 people
     wounded by gunshots per year. Such effects would not be definitively
     detectable with national data
       While I agree with their further sentiment that any life saved is
       significant (especially to that person), that is not in and of
       itself validation for a ban, otherwise we would ban alcohol (again)
       and cars and cigarettes and knives and everything else in this
       country that would save more than 100 lives per year if they were
       banned.
       I do not think we have so much a difference in belief as a
       difference in where to draw the line and why. After all, your
       stated position is that people should be allowed to own guns, which
       means you are willing accept a certain degree of gun violence as
       part of that belief. As am I. Just as I suppose you, I and just
       about everyone reading this accept that alcohol should be legal,
       despite it being a factor in quite a bit of harm done.
       That background checks of some sort are a good idea, we agree. My
       only problem is that you are using bad arguments to advance the
       idea. On a ban of high-capacity magazines, where "high" is by all
       admissions a completely arbitrary number (8 in NY, 16 in CO, 11
       proposed by you, etc.), on that we disagree. And apparently, so do
       the experts.

     The agency is also pursuing similar claims against two other
     companies, Zen Magnets of Denver and Star Networks USA of Fairfield,
     N.J., which sells Magnicube Magnet Balls and Magnet Cubes. Star
     Networks had agreed to stop selling its products but reversed its
     decision, Mr. Wolfson said.

     Company officials could not be reached for comment.
     Shihan Qu, founder of Zen Magnets, said the company was considering
     selling the magnets individually, rather than in packs of a few
     dozen, as a possible way to avoid a clampdown by federal regulators.
       if it's small enough to go in a child's mouth it will be forced off
       the market.
       You are also apparently misinformed about what the experts think,
       since the consensus opinion is clearly and simply

     Ban the future sale and possession of large capacity (greater than
     10 rounds) ammunition magazines.
       I don't know why you are claiming otherwise, except for arguing for
       the sake of arguing.
       And just because you claim the data is weak doesn't make the data
       weak. it's strong enough to act, but further data would be welcome.

     After all, your stated position is that people should be allowed to
     own guns, which means you are willing accept a certain degree of gun
     violence as part of that belief. As am I. Just as I suppose you, I
     and just about everyone reading this accept that alcohol should be

       I don't take issue with that, I'm not working to get all guns and
       ammo banned. I want certain guns and ammo banned. And I want them
       kept out the hands of of people who will do damage (Wintemute's
       main points).  Sure we disagree about some stuff (that's allowed).
       We agree about a whole lot, too. ;-)
       I don't expect guns to disappear. I expect them to be used
       responsibly, and like Buckyballs, the best way to see that happen
       is to take steps to limit egregious use.

       The calls for high-capacity magazines have exactly one thing in
       common, and that is that they are entirely arbitrary. Why is the
       limit in NY 7, in CO 15 and your preference 10? Are there competing
       studies of the epidemiology of shooting incidents, showing that one
       of these is a magic number and the others are based on some faulty
       interpretation of the data?
       Is the actual magic number determined by rigorous research a value
       of 10.7 and someone just decided to round it to 10? If 10 is the
       right number, can we expect to hear you calling for the NY numbers
       to be repealed as 30% too restrictive?
       No, as far I can tell, 7, 10 and 15 are totally arbitrary numbers,
       made up by congressmen or state legislatures based on a
       self-serving calculation of "how much will get gun control people
       to vote for us?" and "how low can we go without losing the votes of
       gun advocates?" Do you really think the NY legislature wrestled
       with scientific studies, and argued about significance values and
       sampling error and standard deviations? Or do you think they said
       "Hmmm, the Colt .45 has a 7 round magazine. We can't go any lower
       than that or we'll piss off no end of people."
       After all, if the magazine limits were based on something
       substantial, you, NY and CO would be in closer agreement on the
       value and the most bandied about restriction limit would be
       something other than the defining value in a base10 arithmetic
       system...
       I would have thought that 8 years of Bush would have made people
       loathe arbitrary laws like the Patriot Act, warrantless
       wiretapping, national security letter gag orders, etc. ad nauseam.
       Apparently not.
       So yeah, I'll oppose a 10 round arbitrary magazine limit just I
       would oppose most other arbitrary feel-good laws.  I'm just not
       into that whole "let's pass a law and then figure out if it was a
       good idea" thing.

       I've never said that or even implied it. My point is to ask (more

       five times as many people as were murdered by rifles in the entire

       (number chosen because that's about how many people were stabbed to
       death by completely unregulated knives, by the way).

     Loughner stopped to reload, but dropped the loaded magazine from his
     pocket to the sidewalk, from where bystander Patricia Maisch grabbed
     it.[24] Another bystander clubbed the back of the assailant's head
     with a folding chair, injuring his elbow in the process,
     representing the 14th injury.[25] Loughner was tackled to the ground
     by 74-year-old retired United States Army Colonel Bill Badger,[26]
     who had been shot himself, and was further subdued by Maisch and
     bystanders Roger Sulzgeber and Joseph Zamudio. Zamudio was a CCW
     holder and had a weapon on his person, but arrived after the
     shooting had stopped and did not draw his firearm.[27] Zamudio later

       experts differed in opinion to the extent that the final statement
       could not be said to have been endorsed by other than with a term
       that means "general agreement". Not "near-unanimous", not "great
       majority", "clear majority" or even "majority". Consensus.
       You and I have a consensus that some reform in gun laws is a good
       thing. That is an accurate use of the word consenus. Now that we
       have a consensus...

     it may not be the case that every expert endorsed every specific

   Hey Ross,

   Guess what?  The price of gas has risen quite a bit since 'teh gays are

   But then again, so has the stock market!

   That MUST mean that GAY marriage is CAUSING THE STOCK MARKET TO RISE!

   GO. GAY. MARRIAGE!  My portfolio needs you!

   If Ross had even a SCINTILLA of intellect, he would recognize the
   following fallacies:

   1. Statistically, correlation does not imply causation as my above
   examples CLEARLY dictate;

   2.  Uh...hey Ross, let's have a closer look at the data in
   CROSS-SECTION: those states with DOMA-type laws have HIGHER divorce
   rates (see: the South/Bible Belt);

   3.  MOST importantly, LET'S LOOK AT THE DATA longitudinally:

   Those states that have allowed gay marriage or something close to it
   have NOT experienced a rapid increase in divorce or out-of-wedlock
   pregnancies.

   #3 is the MOST compelling social science argument to THOROUGHLY DEBUNK
   Ross's lame argument and guess what Ross?

   That's exactly what Frum himself noted!  Gay marriage recognition in
   Massachusetts did not impact 'traditional marriage' at all.

   One editorial discussing D.C.'s obsession over the deficit comes down
   squarely in favor of leaving Social Security out of the discussion for
   reasons we at DailyKos have heard from our own members.  But it's
   helpful to have the NYT weight in on the matter.  Regarding the
   president's offer to change the [1466]way Social Security COLA's are
   figured:

     The question now is whether Mr. Obama will again propose to cut the
     COLA when he unveils his budget next week. We think he should not do
     so. The president might want to seem like he is willing to
     compromise by renewing his call for a COLA cut. But Republicans
     already spurned his offer and are unlikely to take him up on it now.
     They are more likely to paint him as a foe of Social Security, which
     would be reinforced by Democrats' opposition to the cut.

     Even if Mr. Obama avoided those pitfalls, a COLA cut is a bad idea,
     as we will explain in this editorial. It also is a distraction from
     the real problems of Social Security.

   This is a relatively long editorial divided into sections as referred
   to in the above quote.  The sections are:

   What is the Problem with Social Security?
   Should It Be Used for Deficit Reduction?
   How Should Social Security Be Reformed?

   Well worth the time to read.

       that suggestion would probably also guarantee nothing would be

       Their second suggestion is raising the amount of the tax 1% over 20

   penned an article a couple days ago regarding a possible meeting of the
   minds between the president and congressional Republicans with respect
   to Medicare.  Eric Cantor (believe it or not) has suggested an approach
   that Obama is considering which may provide [1561]some common ground..

     Mr. Obama assured House and Senate Republicans during recent
     separate visits that he could support specific cost-saving changes
     to Medicare and deliver Democratic votes, though only as part of a
     "balanced" package that had additional revenues.

     Several changes are likely to once again be in his annual budget,
     which will be released on April 10, after Congress returns from its
     break. Mr. Obama also plans a dinner with Senate Republicans that
     night.

     In particular, participants say, the president told House
     Republicans that he was open to combining Medicare's coverage for
     hospitals and doctor services. That would create a single deductible
     that could increase out-of-pocket costs for many future
     beneficiaries, but also could pay for a cap on their total expenses
     and reduce the need to buy Medigap supplementary insurance.

     Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican,
     proposed much the same in a speech in February. "We should begin by
     ending the arbitrary division between Part A, the hospital program,
     and Part B, the doctor services," he said. "We can create reasonable
     and predictable levels of out-of-pocket expenses without forcing
     seniors to rely on Medigap plans."

     While Mr. Cantor's proposal got little attention at the time, its
     echo by Mr. Obama hints at a new route toward compromise -- in
     contrast with the budget that House Republicans passed this month
     that has no chance of Senate approval.

   Speaking as a Medicare recipient, I would welcome the ability to drop
   the need for purchasing medigap policies.  But as always, the devil
   will be in the details.

   P.S.  If you have never heard of Robert Pear, I consider him the best
   reporter I've ever read on the subject of health care in the U.S.

   I found Hutson's piece to be interesting overall, and I've read books
   in the past that cover the way external forces influence our
   decision-making, especially on ethical problems.  However, I was
   troubled by his opener.  He tried to present drone strikes and torture
   as having utilitarian value (despite being moral abominations from a
   deontological standpoint); however, there is little reason to believe
   that torture and drone strikes actually save lives.  The innocent
   civilians who get killed by drone strikes were not going to do any
   harm, and we can't even be sure about the intentions of those the
   administration has deemed "militants," because they've defined that
   word so broadly that it includes practically all men who've passed
   puberty.  Torture, moreover, does not produce reliable information, and
   both likely serve to radicalize local populations and destroy American
   credibility---obviously increasing a future risk potential.

   I find the use of hypotheticals for both of those to be somewhat
   troubling (e.g. "Would you support the torture of this person if you
   knew....") because it seems like an attempt to condition people into
   accepting moral atrocities through a belief in utilitarian benefits.

   I said the same thing at the time. As soon as I heard "Biden is going
   to get back to me with a report" I knew this was going to be basically
   dead.

   Fact is, everybody knew what needed to be in a bill. It has been on the
   shelf for years. Biden's 30 days of meetings didn't produce anything
   new. We just could have run with Feinstein's bill on Jan. 4th and used
   every day of the run up  the inauguration to push for a vote or face
   wrath at the inauguration speech.  Furthermore, it gave the NRA time to
   regroup, reorganize, and measure. You know what the NRA is sending
   around to the Hill? Statistics about their massive increase in
   fundraising, membership and gun sales.

   The time to strike and get a vote on the record was immediately. Even
   if it lost, the blowback at the time would have been damaging in the
   run up to 2016. It still could be, but I doubt it.

   Pretty much no chance we're going to get a bill in my view and the
   Democrats deserve their share of the blame. Unless of course, you
   believe the argument that Dems never wanted to do anything in the first
   place and this was all kabuki. Could be.

       Right after the Newtown massacre, when I heard Jay Carney say "Now

       gun violence in this country. Congress clearly doesn't give a crap
       about all the children being killed due to out-of-control gun
       violence in this country. I'm not sure if the Dems never wanted to
       do anything in the first place, but I do know that if the Dems in

 Yes, the "I'll appoint a commission to make ([1615]0+ / 0-)

   recommendations" tactic was a deliberate stall rather than to demand
   immediate action.

   And with time, the urge to change fades. Thus, no change.

 Douthat's argument is like gambler's luck: ([1619]6+ / 0-)

   It only works in hindsight.

   All of those bad things that have been happening to marriage and family
   -- and I do think they're bad -- were happening before gay people could
   get married.

   Gay marriage isn't going to make a difference. It's a different issue.
    If anything, it makes us revisit the question of why marriage matters
   and reminds us that there is more to  interpersonal relationships than
   the burning down below.

   If it makes you feel better, Ross, I've been married nearly 28 years
   now and gay marriage has not made me want to walk out on my family.

   I'll admit that I really enjoy Neill Patrick Harris.  Make of that what
   you will.

       Douthat is a pretty poor reasoner. All of his constructs take a
       premise then go out and find some supporting data (ignoring other
       data.
       He'll lose this argument like he loses most arguments.

   lack of concern about the nation's children and their very lives.  The
   only way we will get gun safety laws is if a shooter goes into an
   OB/Gyn clinic and shoots a dozen pregnant women in the waiting room in
   a way that results in the women surviving and not the fetuses.  A
   grisly event that would put right wing talk into a swirl of lunatic
   ramblings.  None would rejoice that the surviving women could return to
   their homes to rear their children, care for their elderly and
   otherwise live out the lives of the born.

   will be shot with a rightful gun. A rightful gun which a responsible
   gun owner lost track of. It's OK the rightful gun owner is going to the
   store to get another rightful gun.

     Seventeen thousand will be younger than 19.

   Never you mind what the gun fanatics say about their precious second
   amendment rights, or about freedom and liberty. The real reason they
   want to keep their guns is so they can go on shooting people.

 Yes. Neccessary. ([1655]0+ / 0-)
       Hunters excepted, gun lovers want guns, almost never because they
       want to shoot people, but because they want to maintain the ability
       to shoot people. They often will cry self-defense, but at the
       unnamable heart of the matter there is often a kind of bloodlust.

       Okay.  So you went from tens of millions of people shooting other
       people to tens of millions of people who are sort of bloodthirsty.
