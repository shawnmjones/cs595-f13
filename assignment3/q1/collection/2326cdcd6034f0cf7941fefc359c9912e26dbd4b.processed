[22]Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: GOP capitulation on Obamacare, losing one's
mind over sequestration

   headlines for today's pundit round-up
   [29]Jonathan Chait, among others, points out that [30]David Brooks'
   awful column on the sequester is merely a symptom of centrist inability
   to admit one side compromises and is reasonable, and Republicans are in
   another place altogether:

     A virulent example of [crazy from the center] has emerged during the
     latest iteration of the fiscal debate. Advocates of what Matthew
     Yglesias calls "BipartisanThink" have found themselves trapped
     between two impulses. On the one hand, they fervently believe that
     the country's most vital priority is to pass a plan to reduce the
     deficit through a mix of cuts to retirement programs and reduced tax
     deductions. On the other hand, they believe with equal fervor that
     the two parties are equally to blame for the country's problems in
     general, and the failure to pass such a plan in particular.

     Their problem is that one party agrees with them completely, and the
     other rejects them. This creates a paradox between the two mental
     tentpoles of BipartisanThink. The solution is to simply wish away
     the facts, thus bringing them into line with reality.

     David Brooks today devotes his column to upholding the known truths
     of BipartisanThink. He lashes out at the obstinacy of the Republican
     Party and its refusal to compromise on the deficit. But he has to
     balance it out by asserting that President Obama, too, lacks any
     such plan...

     Second Update: Brooks does an interview with Ezra Klein, which ends
     up as a total takedown. Brooks admits Obama does have a plan, but
     takes refuge in the claim that the Congressional Budget Office
     didn't score it. Klein informs him that the CBO doesn't score
     informal negotiating offers, but did score the elements as they
     appeared in Obama's budget. The best part is when Brooks asserts
     that a centrist Democrat like Robert Rubin would be proposing
     something way more moderate than what Obama is offering:

     Brooks: In my ideal world, the Obama administration would do
     something Clintonesque: They'd govern from the center; they'd have a
     budget policy that looked a lot more like what Robert Rubin would
     describe, and if the Republicans rejected that, moderates like me
     would say that's awful, the White House really did come out with a
     centrist plan.

     Klein: But I've read Robert Rubin's tax plan. He wants $1.8 trillion
     in new revenues.

     That is a brutal bluff-calling.

   Robert Rubin et. al. tax plan David Brooks didn't have time to read:

   Ezra's interview with Brooks is [35]here. It took place at [36]the
   salad bar at Applebee's.
   [37][bb56yqs3gn9j6vndelwf_normal.png] What did David Brooks think the
   upside was in doing that dialogue with @EzraKlein?
   -- [38]@mattyglesias via [39]Tweetbot for Mac
   [40]David Brooks' postscript:

     The above column was written in a mood of justified frustration over
     the fiscal idiocy that is about to envelop the nation. But in at
     least one respect I let my frustration get the better of me. It is
     true, as the director of the Congressional Budget Office has
     testified, that the administration has not proposed a specific
     anti-sequester proposal that can be scored or passed into law. It is
     not fair to suggest, as I did, that tax hikes for the rich is the
     sole content of the president's approach. The White House has
     proposed various constructive changes to spending levels and
     entitlement programs. These changes are not nearly adequate in my
     view, but they do exist, and I should have acknowledged the balanced
     and tough-minded elements in the president's approach.

   Many of his columns aren't fair for similar reasons, but this time he
   got called on it. Good for the pundit community for doing so.

   More below the fold.

   [41]Dana Milbank:

     "It is not a white flag of surrender," Florida Gov. Rick Scott said.

     This was technically true: Scott did not wave a banner of any color
     when he announced Wednesday that he wants Florida to expand
     Medicaid, a key piece of Obamacare.

     But make no mistake: Scott, a tea party Republican and outspoken
     critic of the law, was laying down arms in defeat.

   Of course he was. There is no substance to tea party opposition to
   Obama's policies, and faced with reality, reality wins eventually.

   [48]Jonathan Bernstein:

     As we get closer to the sequestration deadline, followed a few weeks
     later by the appropriations deadline that could cause a government
     shutdown, new polling by Pew reminds everyone why the Republican
     position is so hard to maintain: people really don't like spending
     cuts. In fact, most Americans want to increase spending on most
     government programs.

     That is, people like the idea of spending cuts when they're
     discussed generally, in terms of the overall cost of government. But
     when it gets down to specific programs, suddenly things change.

   Understand that the GOP is addressing their base alone, because they've
   lost the argument with everyone else, who thinks they are insane.

   [49]Michael Gerson:

     The Republican Party needs a reality check

     The Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, lost by 5 million votes to a
     beatable incumbent presiding over an anemic economy. The explanation
     is not purely technical or personality oriented. At the national
     level, Republicans have a winning message for a nation that no
     longer exists.

   For starters. Of course, Obama won because of the economy, not despite
   it.

    [50]Keith Naughton (Republican):

     For years the NRA has outworked, outspent and, most importantly,
     outfoxed the gun-control lobby. The NRA plays politics better and
     smarter than just about anyone else in Washington. The gun-control
     lobby plays politics worse than just about anyone.

     The crux of the problem is that the gun-control lobby has chosen to
     be wholly dependent on the Democratic Party, while the NRA -
     although primarily supporting Republicans - actively and
     aggressively seeks out Democrats to support. The last thing the NRA
     wants is to be completely reliant on one party. By supporting a key
     group of Democrats, the NRA not only has a voice in the Democratic
     caucus but also forces the Republicans to support them right down
     the line - after all, GOP leaders have nowhere else to go.
     The NRA has shown it can and will support a Democrat over a
     Republican - and win. Thus, the NRA is both courted and feared.
     After the 2006 Democratic takeover of Congress, no less a figure
     than Rahm Emanuel, then chairman of the Democratic Congressional
     Campaign Committee, crowed about how key NRA support was to the
     Democrats' victory.

     Where is the gun-control lobby in all this? Nowhere.

   Article should be past tense: while the article may once have been
   accurate, the world has changed.

   [51]Politico:

     They stormed into office two years ago willing to knock heads and
     make enemies. But now several Republican governors are suddenly in a
     fix - up for reelection next year in states that Barack Obama
     carried in November, and with dangerously low approval ratings.

     So the GOP executives -- including well-known figures like Scott
     Walker and John Kasich --are swearing off polarizing battles over
     union power and budget cuts and presenting a softer side to voters.
     Instead of red-meat conservative causes, they're emphasizing the
     pocketbook issues that got them elected in the first place -- a
     shift that will likely be on display this weekend at the National
     Governors Association's winter meeting in Washington.

   That's the republicans. Then there's a Democrat.

   [52]Colin McEnroe on CT's D Governor:

     Watch Dan Malloy closely right now, and you might see that rare
     thing: A politician who has ditched politics in favor of moral
     seriousness.

     That, at least, is my current working theory of Malloy. I believe
     what he saw and heard in the early hours at Sandy Hook changed him
     irreversibly. I believe his moment at the open casket of Noah
     Posner, where the missing lower part of the little boy's face was
     covered with a cloth, both wounded and electrified the governor.

     To understand him right now, you might be better off reading Tolstoy
     or Dostoyevsky than political commentary. He has seen a terrible,
     undeniable reality and now searches for a moral response to it.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [67]Civil
   Rights, [68]Community, [69]Congress, [70]Culture, [71]Economy,
   [72]Education, [73]Elections, [74]Energy, [75]Environment, [76]Health

   [82]National Security, [83]Science, [84]Transportation, or [85]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([86]California, [87]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       the "Sequester" is driving americans to be more and more agitated
       and anxious.
       I have clients in my groups terrified that the government is going
       to shut off their checks. They'll be evicted. They'll be homeless.
       They are terrified.
       Then we have the possibility or appearance that a major league
       dumbass in Florida [140]shot his family and killed himself over
       sequester-related propaganda bullshit.

     A depressed Florida man shot his wife and two children before
     killing himself after closing his hot air balloon business and
     facing losing his job as a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
     inspector because of automatic budget cuts known as "sequestration."
       It is just irresponsible of Republicans (and to the extent dems
       allow this to go on by being weak and inneffectual) are keeping
       this horseshit at a fever pitch, threatening Americans with a
       wholly-needless disaster.
       At some point it is my hope that Americans figure it out and
       Republicans wake up to a reality that they are not safe in public.
       Nothing else is working to stop their bullshit.

   It's Democratic horseshit because the sequester itself will not be a
   disaster.  It might even be the best thing that's happened to the
   country in years. Compared to TARP, it is A number 1 deliciousness.

   The real horseshit is the parade of terribles being trotted out about
   the aftermath of the sequester, and that seems to be coming from
   Democrats -- or branches of the government that are under
   administration control.

   The total size of the non-defense sequester is only 2/3 the size of the
   original Sandy Hook relief bill.  Many things -- including Social
   Security -- are exempted from cuts.

   We can survive the sequester.
   On the other hand, Republicans, their bluffs called and Defense cuts in
   place, will have to negotiate to get any of that money back in the
   budget. Unfortunately for them, the sequester hits defense harder than
   civilian programs so they'll be negotiating from behind the eight ball.

       Don't know what brutal ass-rape you refer to, given that we've been
       subjected to a steady stream of it for years, but I agree that our
       leaders don't fear the people.
       I'm more optimistic than you are, however.
       First, it's not four years between votes.  It's two years.
       Yes, four years for the President (and most Governors), but two
       years for Congress and Congress holds the purse strings.
       Second, people have become more willing to vote out incumbents.
       Not willing enough, but more willing.
       That will make a difference, but not instantly.
       Finally -- remember SOPA?
       I don't recall that getting passed.
       See stories in the news about Republicans governors expanding
       Medicaid? That comes from sticking their fingers out to see which
       way the wind is blowing.
       At some point, something vaguely resembling reason will prevail.
       Won't last long and won't make anybody especially happy, but it

       low-income families will suffer damage that is most certainly
       unnecessary and may very well be irreversible by cuts mandated in
       the sequester.
       The only reason we're having this ludicrous debate in the first
       place is because Republicans in congress refuse to accept tax
       increases for the portion of the population that has garnered the
       most substantial proportion of the tax cuts and benefits of
       increased productivity for the past 30+ years.
       The system has been arranged so that the poor have no more left to
       give, the middle class is staggering under the weight of the fiscal
       burden, and the moneyed interests, already flush, continue to rack
       up the fruits of any economic growth.

       In the old days (pre-Reagan), the tax dollars of WE the PEOPLE

       Sequestration cuts to the military-industrial complex (13% -

       a few years - both parties will see to that, even if it takes

   Recommended by:

   The sequester is going to hit workers in the discretionary spending
   part of the federal budget hard.  500,000 civil servants on the
   discretionary budget represent a marketplace of households that have
   already started belt tightening, and that will propagate through the
   economy. Effects of that are already observable.

   On the other side of the budget, hundreds of thousands of DOD
   contractor households will be doing the same.  Many of those households
   are deep in red states, and those contractors vote goop. Go figure. But
   in combination the sequester cuts have the potential of contracting the
   national economy to the point of causing a second dip to the GOP's
   Great Recession.

   Dinotrac, you are just plain wrong, but it's nice you can whistle past
   the graveyard.

   If the cuts could be focused on reducing funding of our machine of
   empire, I'd be fine with them too. But I disagree that it's the only
   way to "put a dent in Defense". Defense cuts were coming anyway. And I
   DO NOT advocate cutting services to our returning vets.

       Will avoiding the "disaster" of a sequester have the same effect as
       avoiding a depression by shoveling out TARP money and ladling out
       the lard contained in the so-called stimulus bill at the beginning

       Pointing out the so-called "parade of terribles" spouted by the
       "pundits and politicians"  is all the rage over at free republic
       and redstate today. I wasn't willing to let all the sequestration
       cheerleading go unanswered in this dKos comment thread. It won't
       take long for the site to lose its progressive credibility if we
       don't call to account posters espousing conservative talking
       points, isn't that right?
       Bush's TARP was probably necessary but evil, while Obama's stimulus
       was certainly necessary though probably too small. (Together, they
       saved millions of peoples' retirement accounts, at the cost of
       lining the nests of the onepers).  I'm sure you disagree (your
       attitude about those programs also seems to me to be more closely
       aligned to views expressed at free republic and redstate).
       I think that the move toward austerity has real potential to drive
       the US into a double dip of the recession that many worldwide are
       still immersed in.
       Whistling past the graveyard is a figure of speech, sorry that it
       confused you.
       The benefits for long-term unemployed workers will be reduced after
       the sequester kicks in. Just saying, since you are clearly very
       concerned about those folks. The underemployed will likely remain
       underemployed if not more so, as the job situation worsens under
       the sequester (worsening of employment conditions under the
       sequester is likely, according to economists).
       But if sequestration is making you and the goopbaggers happy,
       that's something anyway.

   bully pulpit to hammer Republicans and point out the fact that they
   don't give a shit if your food is toxic or your plane never gets off

   It looks to me like the Administration has a strategy to hype up how
   catastrophic the sequester would be -- both by targeting the cuts where
   they will be most visible (like air traffic controllers and TSA
   screeners), and by a steady stream of press releases on how bad it's
   gonna be. That's designed, I assume, to pressure the House GOP to do
   something reasonable. (Fat chance.) In the process, however, it is
   scaring the bejeesus out of the rest of us.

   IMO, this is getting so old. We've already fallen off a gazillion
   invented cliffs that turned out to be a 2-inch curb, and I expect this
   to be another such. That's the trouble with governing-by-crisis -- it
   gets less and less effective as people realize that it's all posturing
   and gamesmanship, and in a few days they'll resolve this one and move
   on to the next one (Mar. 27, when the entire government will shut down,
   for those keeping score at home).

       Grab the narrative now and keep hold of it. The bully pulpit is the
       cheapest and most effective way for the Democratic Party to put out
       its message. If you keep your eyes on the President, you are not
       keeping them on John Boehner. All Boehner has right now is bad
       snark. Every time he says he didn't like the sequester, the video
       of him saying "I got 98% of what I wanted." rolls out. (It doesn't
       on Fox News, but that's beside the point.)
       I think Ray LaHood's news conference on what could happen was
       great. First of all, I am sad to see him go. He pushed for bike
       lanes and hybrids and public transportation while in office, and
       all of this while still being a Republican. His warnings about what
       will happen on March 1 were telling. The effect might be seen that
       day with a lot of frustration at airports all over this country. If
       what he says will happen happens, people will be pissed. What's
       worse? It comes just a few weeks before Spring Break. Future voters
       might get caught up in this if the sequester persists and if the
       Republicans shut down the government (again) on March 27th,
       Democrats will be able to say "I told you so." 2014 will not come
       fast enough for a lot of people.

       Obama can request a press conference.  He can say: we've tried it
       their way (and play the by now famous "I've got 98% of what I
       wanted" footage).  And now we are going to try it the Democrats'
       way. If we reach the point where government workers have to be
       furloughed and your safety, jobs and travel are about to take a
       nose dive, I will order departments to continue working at previous
       levels  and will do whatever is necessary to see that they get
       paid.  The President does have that authority.
       No soldier (or government contractor) has ever failed to be paid in

   Beyond all the budget numbers and legislative doublespeak there are
   real people that will be directly affected by any budget proposal. We
   need to have a broad simulation done against these proposals to
   demonstrate how the public will be affected by these changes?

   How many people will likely end up on unemployment?
   How many people will need food stamps?
   How will this affect those that rely on these entitlements?
   How many deaths could be attributed to people going homeless?
   It goes on and on...

   There are ways to simulate the real life affects that could occur based
   on these very direct changes to the American People. But are the simple
   CBO numbers really capturing what it means for those living paycheck to
   paycheck?

   My fave part of the APR this AM was the piece by Chiat and his use of
   the words "by-partisan think." This idea that both sides must be
   blamed, no matter that one side is grossly more responsible for the
   disfunction is the most putrid thing about way too much of today's
   punditry.

   The "No-labels" thing translates to me as "Not going to take a stand on
   anything." This country was set up as a perpetual debate between two
   parties, and that's exactly what should happen. Compromise is a
   necessary and inevitable outcome, but it is a result that's only
   valuable when Americans have heard the full premises of the arguments.

   When we are partisan we are standing up for what we believe in, or
   least for the party we think gives us the best chances to achieve that.
    I don't remember all this talk about partisanship when the GOP was
   leading this country off the cliff in so many ways. Interesting and not
   a coinky dinky that the whole "No labels" thing sprung up under
   President Obama.

   IMO, it is just another disenfranchisement of his presidency---the idea
   that there's no place for "Obama Democrats," the way there was for
   Regan Republicans and all the rah rah rah that came with that.

   This country would shrivel up and die without partisanship, and I'm
   sick to puke of the word being demonized and misunderstood.

   anything real on real issues." Theodore Roosevelt.

   I feel that many at the state level are fed up with the GOP governors
   and the Tea Party wrecking their statehouses. All the anti-union,
   vagina invading, anti-abortion, parental right  craziness has totally
   wrecked the state level GOP.

   The Republicans thought that they were setting up a new base through
   gerrymandering and legislative coups using canned ALEC legislation. But
   in the end I feel strongly that it is backfiring on them.

   Give it another year or at the most two and the GOP will be back on
   their heels again at the state level. They just never learn that you
   can't fool people all the time.

       Currently on the rec list: [742]Kansas Town Hall goes Wrong for
       Senators, House Members, where our two senators and a House member
       were being harassed about getting Obama impeached:

     But they should have expected it.   The crowd turned quickly to the
     kind of questions that the senators didn't want to go on the record
     with and Representative Yoder had to feel a bit uncomfortable.

     Asked repeatedly:   Why can't we impeach Obama?    The dismissive
     response as given by the members resulted in furious facebook posts
     to their pages:

     I attended and was disappointed as well. Congressman Yoder keeps
     talking about upholding the Constitution but when pushed about
     impeaching Obama he is very noncommittal. If the president is
     refusing to uphold laws of the United States then that is
     malfeasance of office which is impeachable!

       Too many people out there that seem to have forgotten all about the
       Bush years and all the laws his administration broke in the fight
       for "freedom".
       But the bottom line for these legislators is simple. Do they want
       to go into the land of "crazy town" and live there permanently? Or
       do they want to make a stand on principles and stay grounded in
       reality. The fringe groups are loud and boisterous, but in the end
       that is all they are. Common sense, while hard to come by, is
       essential at this time. Giving in to the crazies will just neuter
       any and all future chances the legislator has for putting forth any
       good work.

   here's a perfect place to start cutting the DOD budget, as reported in
   the [763]New York Times.

     The Pentagon said on Friday that it had grounded all of its stealthy
     new F-35 fighter jets after an inspection found a crack in a turbine
     blade in the engine of one of the planes.

     The suspension of flights comes at an awkward time for the military,
     which is facing automatic budget cuts that could slow its purchases
     of the planes. The Pentagon grounded all three versions of the jets
     -- for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines -- on Thursday while
     it investigated the problem.

     Lockheed Martin, which makes the high-tech plane, said 64 of the
     jets would be affected. The Pentagon estimates that it could spend
     as much as $396 billion to buy 2,456 of the jets by the late 2030s.
     But the program, the most expensive in military history, has been
     plagued by cost overruns and delays, and it could easily become a
     target for budget cutters.

   The F-15 has been at the center of controversy since the program was
   approved, first because of its cost and finally by the repeated failure
   of the planes to meet deadlines and specification requirements.

   Considering perhaps as many as 5000 people are employed directly or
   indirectly by the gun industry in a small state of Connecticut this is
   a fairly strong cartoon. ("Colt" are based in Connecticut and not that
   far from Newtown.)

   Here's Colin McEnroe on Governor Dan Malloy:

     Watch Dan Malloy closely right now, and you might see that rare
     thing: A politician who has ditched politics in favor of moral
     seriousness.

     That, at least, is my current working theory of Malloy. I believe
     what he saw and heard in the early hours at Sandy Hook changed him
     irreversibly. I believe his moment at the open casket of Noah
     Posner, where the missing lower part of the little boy's face was
     covered with a cloth, both wounded and electrified the governor.

     To understand him right now, you might be better off reading Tolstoy
     or Dostoyevsky than political commentary. He has seen a terrible,
     undeniable reality and now searches for a moral response to it.
     ...
     The reason his budget address was such a discordant mess is that he
     isn't going to be any good at anything until his moral rock slide
     reaches an angle of repose. And the reason that, last week, he blew
     up the process he had helped to start -- the work of two Newtown
     task forces -- is that he couldn't stand it anymore. He's currently
     a politician who can't do politics. My guess is, he isn't sleeping
     well. My guess is, he has a sickness of the soul that won't go away
     until he believes he has done the right thing. And maybe not even
     then.

   Move beyond Reagan-era nostalgia?

   I can't detect any Reagan-era nostalgia in the current GOP.

   They invoke his name, that's for sure, but nostalgia requires some
   memory, and these folks seem to have no clue as to what Reagan was
   actually like in his Presidency.

   For one thing, the most conservative President ever was actually able
   to work with Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Congress.

   The most conservative President ever was able to recognize an
   opportunity and go against stereotype to initiate negotiations on START
   1.

   The man who was once Governor of California and would soon be the most
   conservative President ever not only opposed the Briggs initiative to
   fire homosexual teachers, but wrote an editorial to that effect in a
   major California newspaper.

   The most conservative President ever agreed to a significant tax
   increase when it appeared that his earlier tax cuts had gone too far.

   And -- about those earlier tax cuts -- they were real and substantial,
   but they also included elimination of a number of deductions.

   In short, the most conservative President ever would not be where
   Republicans are today.  The most conservative President ever would have
   made a deal and worked to get the country back on track.

   To badly paraphrase Lloyd Bentson's famous line:

   GOP, I remember Ronald Reagan, and you are no Ronald Reagan.

       and a decent case can be made (which, of course, I have for a few
       years now ;-P)...
       the GOP is only interested in power, not governance. Assume they
       don't see the two as being related (i.e doing a good job with
       governance gets you elected) the way Democrats do.
       Accept that as a thought experiment, and everything they do (and,
       as importantly, don't do) becomes clear.

       then why would you work it make it better?
       Tea Partiers are using this to push the ideology down everyone
       else's throats, screw the opposition.
       Brownback is out here pushing the far right's tax agenda (slash
       spending, eliminate business income taxes, make poor and middle
       class people pay more through removal of mortgage and property tax
       deductions), and even elected Republicans (well, one at least) are
       becoming alarmed:

     Brian Jones has been an admirer of Republican Sam Brownback's fiscal
     conservatism going back to Brownback's days as an anti-tax
     congressman in the 1990s. But now the real estate company owner from
     southeast Kansas finds himself in the odd position of fighting hard
     against the governor's plan for phasing out the state income tax.

     Brownback has been lionized by the GOP right for trying to end the
     personal income tax, something not accomplished by any state in more
     than 30 years. In his two years in office, he has aimed to make
     Kansas a national testing ground for conservative theories about
     economic prosperity.
     But the push, which he began with a 24 percent cut in the top rate,
     now depends on wiping out deductions claimed by more than 300,000
     homeowners. He suddenly confronts the conundrum that just because
     taxpayers want to get rid of taxes doesn't mean they're ready to
     give up favorite tax breaks.

   also passed a bill as governor of California that legalized abortion.
   And don't forget his "amnesty bill":

     In 1986, Reagan signed an immigration reform bill, the first in 20
     years, that legalized the status for 1.7-million people.

     Some defenders of the law dispute the term "amnesty."

     But here's how Edwin Meese, Reagan's former attorney general,
     characterizes what his boss did: "President Reagan called this what
     it was: amnesty. Indeed, look up the term 'amnesty' in Black's Law
     Dictionary, and you'll find it says, 'the 1986 Immigration Reform
     and Control Act provided amnesty for undocumented aliens already in
     the country.' "

     Reagan signed the bill after Republicans and Democrats cobbled
     together an amnesty program in response to concerns from farmers
     worried about harvesting profits. The official record of
     congressional debates shows that lawmakers intended the program to
     provide a steady supply of labor for growers of perishable crops,
     such as cherries, grapes, peaches, etc. At the time the bill was
     written, however, "perishable" was defined so loosely that more
     durable crops such as potted plants, tobacco and seedlings were
     lumped in as well.

   Brooks' attempt at playing to centrism is ridiculous mostly because he
   isn't a centristr nor can he even lay claim to consistent "High

   claimed to be above partisanship. Brooks obviously is a partisan and
   was hired to be a "reasonable conservative". Unfortunately, he quickly
   became a pretty hacky, knee jerk conservative. Friedman has the pox on
   both your houses niche at the Times and Brooks can't even come close to

   Truth telling gets you fired (Dan Froomkin) or banned from chat shows

   morning, Greg!

   Lots to mull over.  I am desolate over what the loss of income is going
   to do to families.  With one-fifth of their paychecks gone, how are
   they going to manage?  Hope they've been trying to save a bit of money
   or stock up on canned food or something.

   Wish someone would sequester the Republicans in Congress.

       most public settings. Sweet tea (but "Glory me! No beer!) was
       served with unlimited refills in quart sized glasses. When I
       watched kids, grade school kids, whose massive thighs pushed their

       Yeah, a problem all over, even overseas, but there I found
       overweight almost a point of pride, being "American" and was told
       as much. I've known of people moving into the D.C. metro area,
       where slim is a goal, being told by friends visiting from down
       there that they needed to fatten up and that this slim thing was
       "elite" and "un American" no less.

   There is no gun-control lobby, rather citizen advocacy groups (like the
   Brady Campaign) to reduce the carnage - none of them is doing it to
   enrich themselves as the NRA is.

   As far as the NRA being an equal opportunity briber/terrorizer, anyone
   that looks into how over half of all current House members have taken
   money from the NRA should be horrified, not bragging.  Yet, just like
   with abortion, birtherism and racism, the NRA is fast becoming one with
   the Republican Party.

   How can this idiot be bragging about the NRA's ownership of Congress
   while one American gets shot every 5 minutes?

   I'm reading a book (Grand Pursuit by Sylvia Nasar) right now that
   discusses how in late 19th century Victorian England the same sort of
   debate was going on, between laissez-faire classical liberals like
   Herbert Spencer (he of Social Darwinism and "survival of the fittest",
   a 19th century precursor to Ayn Rand), who were absolutely against
   government spending on the poor and public works projects, believing
   that the "free market" would best handle these, and radical liberals
   like Joseph Chamberlain (father of Neville), who believed that
   government must do these things, for moral AND economic reasons.

   Guess who was right? Guess who won?

   Guess who's baaaaack?

       generations gut level history conveying lessons learned the hard
       way. That "greatest generation" that knew in their guts the lessons
       of the Great Depression and WW II tried to shield their offspring
       (I know because I was a tad older and watched) from the gut searing
       pain. Those children grew up and had children further shielded from
       pain by an ascendent nation riding on recovery from that pain. Then
       masses of those young turned to the siren song of "government bad,
       private good" and kill the New Deal of front man RR.
       C. J. Cherryh in Hammerfall, a story about a planet subjected to
       civilization smashing meteor rain at long intervals, put it quite
       well:

     One needs not erase history. One needs only fail to teach one
     generation of children. Fail with two, and the destruction widens.
       We, and other civilizations before, have miserably failed to pass
       hard learned wisdom down generation to generation. Our teaching of
       history, itself too often a disparaged subject, has focused on
       dates, events and personalities rather than the lessons historical
       populations learned,  why and how it applies now. Of course any
       attempt to do so would raise the opposition of those that prefer a
       docile, sheep like society.

       Jonathon Chait is definitely becoming a favorite writer, he really

     He's trying to be fair-minded and reasonable. But his admission that
     he misstated Obama's alleged lack of a fiscal plan out of
     "frustration," rather than ignorance is damning. Everybody gets
     things wrong but you can't just print false factual claims to make a

     conceives of politics in grand ideological archetypes, rather than
     building his beliefs on the basis of facts and evidence. He's
     inadvertently displaying how a generalized belief in moderation

 Oliver Willis on "centrists" ([1352]4+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1353]Greg Dworkin, [1354]Ohkwai, [1355]belle1, [1356]codairem

     Fournier has been filing reports from his magical world, berating
     President Obama for acting like a Muggle and getting convenient
     links from Matt Drudge and company. He wonders why oh why President
     Obama doesn't just solve the problem of Republican stubbornness.

     Like most independent voters, I just want it fixed. I want my
     leaders to lead.

     Of course, here in the Muggle world, most of us understand that
     despite his considerable political skills, President Obama is a
     mortal and doesn't have access to Dumbledore, the Ministry of Magic,
     or a magical spell of "obstructum removo" to dissipate Republican
     obstruction to his presidency.

     There's no way Obama can cast a spell to get Republicans to accept a
     deal that includes numerous concessions to them. There's no magical
     way Obama could get the Republican party to accept stimulus that
     included many of their tax cut ideas, or health care reform based on
     work done at one of the top conservative think tanks. Obama simply
     doesn't have a spell in a book somewhere that will magically force
     the Republican party to stop obstructing his judicial nominees or
     from filibustering the nomination for his Secretary of Defense.

     Fournier (and David Brooks) exist in a world where you just type the
     word "compromise" into a column seven hundred times and expect it to
     work in the real world.

   All of the GOP's "new" image is merely a superficial "Etch-A-Sketch"
   tactic to mask their core philosophy of no to anything. Apply it to
   Kasich, Jindal, Christie, Rubio, et. al.
   Only the meganuts like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh,
   Steve King, etc.. remain true to their steadfast absurdities!

   While the GOP may well need a reality check, what they need before that
   is a reality map, I don't think they can even FIND reality, but less
   check it.

   Words can sometimes, in moments of grace, attain the quality of deeds.
