Two teens facing murder, robbery charges in WWII vet's beating death

   By Michael Pearson, CNN
   updated 11:04 PM EDT, Mon August 26, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * The two 16-year-olds are charged as adults, a spokeswoman says
     * Several others with suspect accused of "rendering criminal
       assistance"
     * WWII vet Delbert Belton tried to fight off his teenage attackers,
       police chief says
     * Police say the incident was a botched robbery and race was not a
       motive

   (CNN) -- [41]Delbert Belton fought to the end.

   Police said Monday that the 88-year-old World War II vet, who died last
   week after a brutal beating in a parking lot in Spokane, Washington,
   tried to fend off his attackers. Two teenagers are in custody,
   including one arrested early Monday.

   [42]Belton's death on Thursday came 68 years after he survived being
   shot in the leg during the World War II battle of Okinawa.

   "He came close to losing his life in service to this country on
   Okinawa, and then he gets killed needlessly on the parking lot while he
   was waiting for a friend," Spokane police Chief Frank Straub Jr. said.

   Belton's efforts to defend himself may have worsened the attack, Straub
   said. The Spokane County Medical Examiner's Office said Belton died of
   blunt facial and head injuries.

   Straub said information provided by church leaders and family members
   led investigators to a Spokane apartment where they found 16-year-old
   Kenan Adams-Kinard early Monday morning.

   Police arrested him in connection with Belton's killing and arrested
   three others who were with him on charges of rendering criminal
   assistance, a felony. Straub did not identify the other three, and it
   was not immediately clear if they were adults or juveniles.

   He described them as friends of Adams-Kinard, one of two teenagers
   accused of trying to rob Belton in the parking lot of Spokane's Eagles
   Lodge.

   Straub called it a botched robbery, and said race did not appear to
   play a role in the attack, despite public speculation to the contrary.

   Authorities named Adams-Kinard during the search for him even though he
   is a juvenile, saying "he represents ... an actual danger to the
   community."

   Authorities have not released the name of the first suspect, who was
   taken into custody last week. But his lawyer identified him as
   Demetrius Glenn, also 16.

   Glenn had his initial appearance in district court on Monday and was
   advised of the charges, said attorney Christian Phelps.

   "We didn't argue bond and it was previously set at $2 million," he
   said.

   It was unclear when Adams-Kinard would make his first court appearance.

   Both suspects were charged with first-degree murder and first-degree
   robbery, Straub said in a statement.

   [43]Random killings spark laments, but reality shows long slide in
   crime rate

   Monique Cotton, a spokeswoman with Spokane police, said the teens were
   charged as adults.

   Coming just days after an Australian baseball player died in a shooting
   that police said was conceived by three teenagers out of boredom,
   Belton's death shocked with its apparent brutality and random nature,
   and left friends and family wondering why it happened.

   "He didn't drive a big fancy car. He didn't didn't dress in expensive
   clothes. He didn't have a lot of money," Belton's daughter-in-law,
   Barbara Belton, told CNN's Alina Machado last week. "What did they
   think they were going to get from this man?"

   Belton, a retired aluminum company worker, was wounded during a battle
   on the Pacific island of Okinawa while fighting in World War II.

   He was affectionately known to friends as "Shorty" because of his
   diminutive height.

   "He was awesome," Lillian Duncan [44]told The Spokesman-Review
   newspaper. "Anybody that didn't get to know him missed out on a
   wonderful angel in their life."

   CNN's Amanda Watts, Chuck Johnston and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this
   report.
