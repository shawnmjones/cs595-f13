[22]Open thread for night owls: UK suppression of NSA/Snowden reporting
should cause a shiver

   Ryan Chittum, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, is deputy editor
   of The Audit, the business section of the Columbia Journalism Review.
   At CJR, he writes [29]Guardian bombshells in an escalating battle
   against journalism. (This article is reprinted in its entirety by
   permission.)

     Guardian Editor Alan Rusbridger filed an astonishing column tonight
    that shows just how far the British authorities are going to suppress
                     the paper's NSA/Snowden reporting:

     A little over two months ago I was contacted by a very senior
     government official claiming to represent the views of the prime
     minister. There followed two meetings in which he demanded the
     return or destruction of all the material we were working on. The
     tone was steely, if cordial, but there was an implicit threat that
     others within government and Whitehall favoured a far more draconian
     approach.

     The mood toughened just over a month ago, when I received a phone
     call from the centre of government telling me: "You've had your fun.
     Now we want the stuff back." There followed further meetings with
     shadowy Whitehall figures. The demand was the same: hand the Snowden
     material back or destroy it. I explained that we could not research
     and report on this subject if we complied with this request. The man
     from Whitehall looked mystified. "You've had your debate. There's no
     need to write any more."

      The man was unmoved. And so one of the more bizarre moments in the
      Guardian's long history occurred - with two GCHQ security experts
     overseeing the destruction of hard drives in the Guardian's basement
       just to make sure there was nothing in the mangled bits of metal
      which could possibly be of any interest to passing Chinese agents.
      "We can call off the black helicopters," joked one as we swept up
                        the remains of a MacBook Pro.

   Prior restraint is the nuclear option in government relations with the
   press and unfortunately, the British don't have a First Amendment. But
    Rusbridger, having gone through the fire with Wikileaks, was prepared
    for that. The paper's journalism is mostly being done in New York and
           the Snowden documents are dispersed in other countries.
       Combine Rusbridger's revelations with news of the detention of
     Greenwald's partner David Miranda by UK authorities and you have a
                         DEFCON 2 journalism event.

    Miranda was serving as a human passenger pigeon, shuttling encrypted
      files on USB drives between filmmaker Laura Poitras and Greenwald
   because, as the whole world now knows, the Internet is fully bugged by
   the US and UK governments. So the UK, using an anti-terrorism statute,
   arrested Miranda on arrival at Heathrow, interrogated him for 9 hours,
   threatened to arrest him, and took his stuff. The war on whistleblowers
        has now escalated to disrupting journalists' communications.

      In light of Rusbridger's disclosures, it's even clearer that the
      detention of Miranda is part of an attack on American journalists
   authorized at the highest levels of the British government, and it's an
       attack that is at the very least implicitly backed by the Obama
                               administration.

        We have the spectacle of communications between two American
      journalists-in-exile--reduced to passing information via courier
   because their government is spying on everything they do online--busted
     up by the US's top ally, apparently with no protest from the Obama
                 administration, which was given a heads-up.

      On top of that, Greenwald's paper has been threatened by its own
   government with prior restraint and had its hard drives smashed in its
                     basement to make a (stupid) point.
    This is police-state stuff. We need to know the American government's
   role in these events--and its stance on them--sooner rather than later.

   And now that you've read that, I highly recommend reading Armando's
   diary: [30]Why The UK Detention of Miranda Was Unlawful.
            _____________________________________________________

   [31]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in
   2002--Chickenhawks push war:

   But the fools in our country's governing junta see things differently.
    For them, war is a political tool, to be wielded when expedient. It's
    no surprise that almost none of the "invade Iraq" cabal have served:
       Bush, Cheney, DeLay, Wolfowitz, Perle, Fleischer, Rice, Barnes,
    Hannity, Kristol, Lieberman, and the master tactician himself -- Rove
                        (Rumsfeld is the exception).

   On the other hand, the veteran contingent in both parties have led the
    anti-war effort -- Powell, Hagel, Kerry (MA), Scowcraft, Schwarzkopf,
     Clark, and the entire uniformed cadre at the Joint Chiefs of Staff
               (Armey is the exception). This is significant.
    As Perle has said, this war is no longer about achieving any notable
    strategic considerations. It's no longer a military campaign. It's a
                  political effort, all about saving face.
     "The failure to take on Saddam after what the president said would
    produce such a collapse of confidence in the president that it would
                       set back the war on terrorism.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       The flood does indeed appear to have subsided.
       Must've blocked the IPs. Or perhaps something in the last update
       regarding the registration process did the trick.
       Whatever it was, that's a significant reduction in bullshit, for
       sure.

       at how well dailykos handles its spammers. Occasional bursts sure,
       but that's unavoidable. Considering the size of the site and that
       its almost entirely based around community discussions, everyone
       does a really great job at making sure this stuff doesn't get out
       of hand.

                US doesn't know what Snowden took, sources say

     By Michael Isikoff, Matthew Cole, and Richard Esposito
     NBC News

     More than two months after documents leaked by former contractor
     Edward Snowden first began appearing in the news media, the National
     Security Agency still doesn't know the full extent of what he took,
     according to intelligence community sources, and is "overwhelmed"
     trying to assess the damage.

     Officials, including NSA Director Keith Alexander, have assured the
     public that the government knows the scope of the damage, but two
     separate sources briefed on the matter told NBC News that the NSA
     has been unable to determine how many documents he took and what
     they are.

     Sources said authorities believe the trove of unreleased materials
     includes details of data collection by U.S. allies, including the
     U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. These English-speaking
     allies, known along with the U.S. as the "Five Eyes," are critical
     to U.S. intelligence efforts.

       this for the NSA or for themselves.

       It's a dodgy way to avoid US laws. Perhaps we let them use our nets
       to catch our intended prey, thus avoiding the prohibitions against
       us doing it directly. Then they hand off their catch off to us. One
       hand washes the other, and the legal niceties are skirted.
       This is just a conjecture without anything to support it. Honest.

     Dad Sticks Up for Guns on Facebook Hours After Toddler Shoots
     Himself:

     Just hours after Brian Holbrook's 3-year-old son fatally shot
     himself with a gun that was improperly stored inside a bedroom
     closet, the Michigan dad took to his Facebook page to affirm his
     continued support for guns.

     Police in Dundee say the toddler was wandering around his own home
     when he stumbled upon the gun inside a case on the floor of an
     unlocked bedroom closet.

     The weapon, which belongs to Joshua Michael Greenhill, a family
     friend who had been living at Holbrook's two-story residence, was
     reportedly loaded, and had a bullet in the chamber.

   But not for the [539]reasons you might think.  It's not that they found
   Paul LePage or the GOP had gone too far.  It's that they hadn't gone
   far enough for their liking.  See, these are part of the "Ron Paul
   Revolution" crowd that took over part of the state party apparatus last
   year.

     This is an uprising by the followers of Crazy Uncle Liberty (!) in
     the state party apparatus. (And, to be fair to them, they did get
     rather coffeehoused out of some delegates by the devotees of the
     Romneybot at the convention.) But, if you're keeping score at home,
     these people bailed on the Maine Republican party because its Tea
     Party governor was insufficiently conservative in the correct ways.

     Hasn't the snake eaten most of its own tail by now?

   Haven't authenticated this quote, but I do find it quite apropos.

     Beyond the obvious, what do a far-right Italian politician, the

     have in common?

     In early September, the men are all scheduled to speak - along with
     a lengthy list of archconservative clergy, lawyers and academics -
     at a conference in Canada sponsored by the Fatima Center, part of

     The National Rifle Association has rallied gun-owners -- and raised
     tens of millions of dollars -- campaigning against the threat of a
     national database of firearms or their owners.

     But in fact, the sort of vast, secret database the NRA often warns
     of already exists, despite having been assembled largely without the
     knowledge or consent of gun owners. It is housed in the Virginia
     offices of the NRA itself. The country's largest privately held
     database of current, former, and prospective gun owners is one of
     the powerful lobby's secret weapons, expanding its influence well
     beyond its estimated 3 million members and bolstering its political
     supremacy.

     That database has been built through years of acquiring gun permit
     registration lists from state and county offices, gathering names of
     new owners from the thousands of gun-safety classes taught by
     NRA-certified instructors and by buying lists of attendees of gun
     shows, subscribers to gun magazines and more, BuzzFeed has learned.

   but the coroner's report has been [705]released on Michael Hastings.
   The story is what his own family is saying.

     Hastings had arrived in Los Angeles from New York the day before the
     accident, with his brother scheduled to arrive later the day of the
     crash "as his family was attempting to get [Hastings] to go to
     detox," the report stated.

     Hastings was believed sober for 14 years, but had recently begun
     using drugs again in the past month or so, according to the
     coroner's office, based on  interviews with family members.

     A medical marijuana card was found in Hastings wallet and had been
     prescribed for treatment of post-traumatic stress resulting from his
     time as a war journalist in Iraq and Afghanistan.

     Hours before the crash, Hastings had last been seen by one witness
     "passed out" sometime between 12:30 a.m. and 1 a.m. The crash
     occurred just before 5 a.m.

   Drug addiction is a motherfucker.  Doesn't matter how many years you're
   clean, all it takes is one relapse.

     According to the LA Times' Andrew Blankstein, Hastings' death was
     ruled as caused by "traumatic injuries" as a result of his fiery car
     crash, and was found to have small amounts of THC and
     methamphetamine in his blood, but the coroner doesn't believe it
     contributed to the crash.

   State Rep. Joe Carr (R) has announced he'll primary Sen. Lamar
   Alexander (R).  And Carr's website promptly [788]misspelled the seat
   he's running for as the U.S. Sentate.  LOL.

   What's more interesting is this nugget:

     Soon after the announcement, Carr's top campaign aide, Chip
     Saltsman, handed in his resignation and said he would join
     Alexander's re-election campaign. "It is because of Lamar Alexander
     that people like you have the honor of serving in the majority of
     the state legislature," Saltsman wrote in his resignation letter.
     "It is because of Lamar Alexander that our children and
     grandchildren go to better schools, and are able to compete for
     better jobs. It is because of Lamar Alexander that we live in a
     state people want to move to, start a family in, start a business
     in, and even retire to. I am honored to support Lamar Alexander for
     re-election."

   Damn, that is some burn.  And [789]Saltsman isn't just some no-name
   aide.  He was the former chair of the Tennessee GOP, was a senior
   advisor to Bill First, and managed Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential
   campaign.

   [863]BuzzFeed article

     Michigan Republican Rep. Kerry Bentivolio said Monday it would be a
     "dream come true" to submit a bill to impeach President Obama.
     Bentivolio also said he had meetings with lawyers asking them to
     "tell me how I can impeach" the President of the United States.
     Bentivolio was speaking at the August 2013 Birmingham Bloomfield
     Republican Club Meeting.

     "If I could write that bill and submit it, it would be a dream come
     true," Bentivolio said. "I stood twelve feet away from the guy and
     listened to him. I couldn't stand being there, but because he is
     president I have to respect the office. That's my job, as a
     Congressman, I respect the office."

     "I went back to my office and I've had lawyers come in" the
     Congressman continued. "These are lawyers, Ph.Ds in history, and I
     said `tell me how I can impeach the President of the United
     States.'"

     The Michigan Congressman then explained to the audience that someone
     couldn't impeach the president without evidence.

     "Until we have evidence, you're going to become a laughing stock if
     you've submitted the bill to impeach the president because number
     one you've got to convince the press," he said. "There are some
     people out there no matter what Obama does he's still the greatest
     president they've ever had. That's what you're fighting."

   Yep, first have lawyers explain to you how to go about impeaching the
   President, then try to go and find any evidence of a crime worthy of
   impeachment.

     Chris Christie Endorses Koch Brothers Operative For Senate

     New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) endorsed Steve Lonegan (R), the
     former New Jersey head for the Koch Brothers' Americans for
     Prosperity, for U.S. Senate on Tuesday. Though Christie ran in 2009
     promising a middle-of-the-road "common-sense approach," this move
     puts him squarely behind a far-right Tea Party candidate best known
     for his attacks on immigration and Spanish-language ads -- and his
     own record of hiring undocumented immigrants.

       Under Christie's watch, NJ has one of the highest unemployment
       rates and worst job creation records in the country.

     The Jersey Comeback." The once prevalent slogan of Chris Christie
     has faded from use as its contrast with reality has sharpened. Under
     the failed economic leadership of Governor Christie, New Jersey has
     not enjoyed the fruits of recovery as the rest of the nation climbs
     back from the economic crisis. The unemployment rate has remained
     one of the highest in the nation, while the state experienced
     economic growth worse than all but three states in 2011. Those jobs
     that have been created have come from below-average paying
     industries. Despite the overwhelming evidence, Gov. Christie has
     been ignorant of the state's economic troubles, complacent in his
     policies that are leaving the New Jersey families behind.

     Citing current and former NSA officials, the newspaper said the 75
     percent coverage is more of Americans' Internet communications than
     officials have publicly disclosed.  The Journal said the agency
     keeps the content of some emails sent between U.S. citizens and also
     filters domestic phone calls made over the Internet.  But officials
     told the Journal the system's broad reach makes it more likely that
     purely domestic communications will be incidentally intercepted and
     collected in the hunt for foreign ones.

     The Journal said that these surveillance programs show the NSA can
     track almost anything that happens online, so long as it is covered
     by a broad court order, the Journal said.

   [1049]http://www.reuters.com/...

   Access without court oversight means "track almost anything."  Can we
   trust NSA awaits court orders, given what we know: that spy agencies
   will lie to our representatives?

       the system is set up to be used much more harshly than it is now.
       The checks and balances have been eroded.
       All it takes is the right sociopath or group of sociopaths to get
       control of the machinery/ the state apparatus that has been built
       and you ain't seen nothing yet.
       'Homeland Security' indeed.
       Sounds a little too close to the motherland or fatherland of Nazi
       Germany or Soviet Russia.
       I never heard ANYONE refer to America as the 'homeland'
       pre 9-11.

   far more valuable then many a closed one.

     We have the spectacle of communications between two American
     journalists-in-exile--reduced to passing information via courier
     because their government is spying on everything they do
     online--busted up by the US's top ally, apparently with no protest
     from the Obama administration, which was given a heads-up.

   Watching these events unfold does cause a shiver. Part of that
   shivering, perhaps most of it, is caused by recognizing the complacency
   of so many about these events...as though each event were isolated and
   explainable as random "errors" undeserving of much attention. While we
   can trace the historical origins of the trajectory agianst an open
   society, where (and how soon it will get there) it will end up exactly
   is unknown. The signs though are not good. The analogies that fit are
   even worse.

   I'm still optimistic though in a humorous pessimistic way.

   Seeing more and more people rallying to the monster because of its

 And you didn't see this coming? Really? ([1222]0+ / 0-)

   Snowden made some whopper level mistakes in this whole mess. The major
   one was threatening to reveal his encrypted treasure trove of
   information that he says was distributed to various sources in case of
   his demise. That is probably one of the main reasons for the draconian
   measures being taken. You drop an open threat of exposure on a
   government covering unknown documents and you have the makings of a box
   office spy movie on steroids.

   Of course, they are going to great measures, even unlawful ones, to
   capture and prevent any and all communications to and from Snowden.
   When he pulled that line out of his hat he might have well publicly
   declared himself a "terrorist". It would have had the same effect.

   The issue of the NSA program of eavesdropping and the secret FISA court
   decisions are one thing which needs to be revised or stopped. But
   Snowden's threat is the real reason for the firestorm we are seeing.
