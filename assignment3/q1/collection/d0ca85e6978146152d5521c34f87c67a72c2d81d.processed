[90]Tea Party looks to fight over every step of Medicaid expansion

   It's Just Politics with Zoe Clark and Rick Pluta

   "War." That was the [98]headline on the conservative blog "Right
   Michigan" following the state Senate's vote this week to approve the
   Medicaid expansion. The GOP right, the Tea Party, say this is a vote
   that will not be forgotten - political collusion with the loathed and
   dreaded Obamacare by eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to get
   it passed.
   Make that nine Tea Party targets if you count Lieutenant Governor Brian
   Calley, who was not forced to but stood ready to cast a tie-breaking
   vote if it was needed to get the expansion passed.
   Last week, we [99]outlined the political challenges facing Calley and,
   since then, a Tea Party opponent emerged. [100]Wes Nakagiri says he is
   putting together a campaign to oust and replace Calley next year at a
   Republican state convention.
   Calley, meanwhile, has gone on counter-offense, adopting the vernacular
   of the Tea Party, and sending out communications heavily laden with
   words like "freedom," "liberty," and "conservative." He is also touting
   the endorsement of Congressman Justin Amash, a favorite of the
   "liberty" wing of the Republican coalition.

   All of this is an effort to begin to re-set the conversation after the
   Senate vote. But there is still more road to travel before the Medicaid
   expansion is complete. The state House must adopt the Senate version to
   get it to Governor Rick Snyder's desk.  The governor is actually
   delaying a trade-building mission to China and Japan to be on hand.
   (Remember, he [101]rushed back from Israel after the Medicaid expansion
   stalled in the Senate earlier this summer.) It's a good bet he'd like
   to sign the bill before joining the trade trip later in the week.

[103]Michigan Court of Appeals rejects House Dems bid to stop 'immediate
effect'

   The Michigan Court of Appeals has sided with House Republicans in the
   dispute over the "immediate effect" rule in that chamber.

   "Immediate effect" allows bills to become effective right after the
   Governor signs them. The Michigan Constitution requires that bills go
   into effect 90 days after the end of a legislative session unless
   two-thirds of the legislature supports the bill.

   Democrats in the House say Republican leaders have not been allowing
   these immediate effect votes to go forward. They took the issue to
   court last March.

   Today's ruling is another blow to their effort to stop the practice.

   From the [109]Detroit Free Press:

     In an opinion released today, a three-member panel of the appeals
     court sent the lawsuit back to Ingham County Circuit Court with
     instructions that it be dismissed.

     The court said taking a voice vote is in compliance with the House
     rules, which the courts do not oversee.

   [110]We asked political analysts Susan Demas and Ken Sikkema about the
   hullabaloo last April. Here's what they had to say:

     According to Sikkema, more than 90% of bills passed in the last 25
     or 30 years got immediate effect. "I was elected in 1986, and the
     first 6 years I was in the House I was in the minority...the same
     thing occurred to me that House Democrats are complaining about
     today."

     So, could there be backlash for Republicans? "That's certainly what
     House Democrats are aiming for here," Demas says. "This is part of
     their ongoing, Republican corruption theme, and their assertion that
     they [Republicans] are not doing a good job.

   Every Thursday we speak with Susan Demas, political analyst for
   Michigan Information and Research Service, and Ken Sikkema, former
   Senate Majority Leader and Senior Policy Fellow at Public Sector
   Consultants.

   This week it's all about the politics and policy behind immediate
   effect, and why it's gotten some national attention.

   Hundred of bills have passed in the Michigan legislature with immediate
   effect tacked on. Democrats have cried foul, and issued a court
   challenge accusing Republicans of not taking required roll call votes.

   This gets into a lot of procedural specifics and we've been
   [120]reporting on this for a couple of weeks. Then suddenly, it hits
   the national stage when Rachel Maddow, a MSNBC host, [121]picked up the
   story. Maddow called it "revolutionary and radical beyond radical."

   Demas says, "I think Maddow needs to calm down and maybe spend a little
   time in Michigan before she starts reporting on the intricacies of
   legislative procedure here."

[123]State commission puts GSRA decision on hold after court ruling

   University of Michigan graduate student research assistants (GSRAs)
   have wanted to hold a vote asking other GSRAs whether or not a union
   should be formed for decades.

   In the past, they've been prevented from holding a vote because the
   Michigan Employment Relations Commission has not allowed a vote to go
   forward.

   Most recently they were prevented from doing so because of a new state
   law banning GSRAs from forming unions at public universities in
   Michigan.

   But the timing of when that new law goes into effect has been hotly
   contested in the courts.

   It's [129]a long, sordid tale that involves parliamentary rules in the
   State House.

   An Ingham County judge had ruled the law cannot go into effect
   immediately, so the Commission scheduled a vote on the UM GSRA
   unionization vote.

   But the Court of Appeals stayed the Ingham County judge's ruling on
   Monday, restoring the immediate effect of the GSRA unionization ban.

   So today, the Michigan Employment Relations Commission decided to table
   a vote on whether to allow the UM GSRAs to go forward with a
   unionization vote.

   In a 2-1 vote, the Commission said any action they take on the issue
   would be moot because of the latest court ruling.

   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The Michigan Court of Appeals has stayed a
   temporary restraining order that favored Democrats in a procedural spat
   with House Republicans.

   Ingham County Circuit Judge Clinton Canady III last week issued the
   order aimed at ensuring Republicans follow certain procedures when
   granting what is called "immediate effect" to bills approved by
   lawmakers.

   That status determines how quickly a new law kicks in once signed by
   the governor.

   The Michigan Court of Appeals may rule today in a dispute about how
   State House Republicans are passing bills.

   House Republicans have tacked on "immediate effect" provisions on more
   than 500 bills this year.  That means the bills will become law as soon
   as Governor Snyder signs them. But Democrats complain the "immediate
   effect" provisions are being added without the constitutionally
   required two-thirds vote.

   No clear path forward in Detroit

   Detroit City Council met yesterday afternoon and did not vote on a
   proposed financial stability agreement with the state. Instead, as
   [150]Michigan Radio's Sarah Cwiek reports, the meeting "started out
   with a contentious public hearing about union contracts, and ended in a
   confusing mess of court challenges--with no clear answer about how the
   whole process will go forward."

   Council is expected to meet again today starting at 10 a.m.

   Gov. Snyder has said his deadline for deciding whether or not to
   appoint an emergency manager is this Thursday (April 5).

   And today at 2 p.m., according to the [151]Detroit Free Press, a
   federal court will hear arguments about whether Gov. Snyder's "pressure
   on the city to scrap ratified [union] contracts violates federal
   due-process rights and contract clauses in the federal and state
   constitutions."

   A separate court hearing on potential violations of the state's open
   meetings act is set to take place next week (April 11). As Sarah Cwiek
   reports:

     Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Joyce Draganchuck has [152]ordered
     the review team not to approve or even discuss a consent agreement
     before an April 11 hearing.

   The court order was called "disturbing" by officials in Gov. Snyder's
   office. They say they will appeal.

   Judge blocks legislative maneuvers by State House Republicans

   Republicans in the State House have passed 500 bills with "immediate
   effect" provisions. With this provision, laws go into effect
   immediately after the Governor signs them, rather than waiting 90 days
   after the legislative session ends.

   To pass an "immediate effect" bill, the legislative body needs a
   super-majority, which it does not have.

   Democrats in the State House sued, saying the Republican majority in
   the State House refuses to hold recorded votes on "immediate effect"
   bills.

   As [153]Michigan Radio's Steve Carmody reported, Ingham County Circuit
   Court Judge Clinton Canady granted a temporary injunction against the
   legislative maneuver. Her order blocks the implementation of three
   bills already signed into law.

   An emergency manager for Muskegon Heights schools?

   With a projected deficit of more than $9 million, a state financial
   review team is recommending that Gov. Snyder appoint an emergency
   manager for the school system.

   Unlike Detroit, an EM appointment here is not likely to be
   controversial. The school board took the unusual step of [154]asking
   for an emergency manager appointment last December.

   Gov. Snyder has ten days to act on the review team's recommendation. If
   one is appointed, the Muskegon Heights schools emergency manager would
   be the seventh emergency manager operating in the state.

   The state House has passed more than 500 bills this year with a
   provision that the bills take effect as soon as the governor signs
   them.    State House Democrats sued, claiming the Republican leadership
   ignored their requests for votes to delay implementation of the bills.

   Attorney Michael Hodge represents the House Democrats.  He says the
   House Republican leadership has been shutting out the minority party.

[172]Court to take up hearing on GOP votes

   A political fight between Republicans and Democrats at the state
   Capitol has landed in court. Democrats in the state House say
   Republicans in the majority are violating the Michigan Constitution.
   The lawsuit says the House GOP majority refuses to hold recorded votes
   on a procedure that requires super-majorities to pass. It allows bills
   to become effective upon being signed by the governor.

   Otherwise, bills cannot become law until 90 days after the end of a
   legislative session. The minority party often uses that to slow down
   controversial measures.

   "We feel the constitution's been violated over the past year plus and
   we have not been allowed to have immediate effect votes," says House
   Democratic Leader Rick Hammell.

   A judge has ordered Republicans to show up in court on Monday to
   explain why they won't hold recorded votes on the procedure. Democrats
   will ask the judge to order record roll call votes.

   Republican leaders say they have complied with the constitution.

   For the last fifteen months, Republicans have controlled everything in
   sight in Lansing -- the House, the Senate, the governor's office and
   the Supreme Court.

   They have the majorities to pass essentially anything they want, and
   even if something is constitutionally controversial, they are secure in
   the knowledge that it's almost certain that the disgracefully partisan
   Michigan Supreme Court will rule in their favor.
