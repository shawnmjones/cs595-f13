[22]Open thread for night owls: Ways the austerity obsession in Washington
could cost you your job

   night owl
   Bob Borosage of the Campaign for America's future writes [29]Ways the
   austerity obsession in Washington could cost you your job:

   The U.S. economy shrank unexpectedly in the last three months of 2012,
      ending over 30 months of economic growth. Exports lagged, in part
      because of declining markets in Europe, now suffering a continued
    recession inflicted by misguided austerity policies. But the greatest
    cause of decline was unexpectedly large cuts in government spending,
       particularly in the military. Yes, Virginia, cutting government
     spending in a weak economy costs jobs. A three-month downturn is a
     caution, not a catastrophe. But Washington seems too wrapped in its
      deficit delusions to pay attention to the flashing yellow lights.
                         Here's a cautionary guide.

                           1. Austerity costs jobs

   This economy is still sputtering. Over 20 million people are in need of
     full-time work. While corporate profits are at record heights as a
     percentage of the economy, wages are at record lows and falling. An
   alarmed Federal Reserve has kept interest rates close to zero. Housing
    prices have started to come back. But companies are cautious, looking
                for customers before they do much expansion.

   In these circumstances, cuts in government spending and hikes in taxes
     on working people cost jobs. Government workers and contractors get
     laid off. Small businesses feel the pinch as the afflicted tighten
    their belts. Interest rates can't go lower; business doesn't get any
    more confident. And as the last three months showed, it doesn't take
              much to push a slow growth economy into decline.

                2. More austerity is already being inflicted

     Last quarter's decline took place before the tax hikes agreed to in
   December's "fiscal cliff" deal. The increase of tax rates on the top 1
    percent will have little effect on demand, since someone making over
     $400,000 can afford the hit. But the end of the payroll tax holiday
     cost the typical family 2 percent of their income, with the change
   visible in their January paychecks. For a family earning $50,000, that
            represents a $1,000 loss of income--and will be felt.

                     3. Even more austerity soon to come

   House Republicans devoted their retreat to reordering the serial fiscal
    hostage taking they have planned for the next five months. The proper
   etiquette of hostage taking, they determined, begins with the threat of
         deep automatic cuts of military and domestic spending--the
      sequester--on March 1, then moves to the threat to shut down the
   government by the end of March, and finally to the threat to default on
   the national debts and shudder the global financial system in mid May.
    This reordering, they believe, gives them greater leverage to extort
    deep and unpopular cuts in spending, particularly Medicare, Medicaid
     and Social Security. The mainstream media hailed this as a sign of
                             their new maturity.

                  4. The deficit hawks are delusional [...]

   Read the rest of Borosage's article to see details of the harm that
   austerity is now causing and will cause in the future if it isn't
   halted.

   [30]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2010--It's the
   Stupid Sex, Stupid:

   After years of warning the Bush administration and social conservatives
   that abstinence-only education does not stop teens from having sex, nor
   does it prevent teen pregnancy, a new study by the Guttmacher Institute
    confirms what many have feared: that deliberately misinforming teens
     about sex can have serious consequences and that comprehensive sex
     education, in addition to the availability of contraception, is the
                  best way to reduce teen pregnancy rates.

   On today's [36]Kagro in the Morning show, we had Greg Dworkin on
   yesterday's Senate hearing and Newtown's town hall, plus the
   "controversy" over whether or not 12/14 parents were heckled. The crazy
   stories keep pouring in, too. Did you know dropping your gun in the
   bathroom is the new hotness? Also: state nullification of federal gun
   laws, and how to build better gun policy. Then, spending cuts vs.
   growth, and the looming sequestration.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       We've added [97]2,731 more users in the last three days.  This is a
       continuation going back to May where we've been absolutely flooded
       with new users.  I'm pretty sure almost all of these new users are
       spammers or bots.  While the rate had been getting faster, it seems
       they suddenly started slowing down right when Hurricane Sandy hit.
        It slowed down to under 1,000 new users in a 24-hour period, and
       we were back down to somewhat over 100 new users every 24 hours or
       so, until yesterday when it exploded again.  What are they
       [98]planning?

       But I'm guessing you're not a [139]Questionable Content fan. The
       author has a gag about YOLO being "You Obviously Like Owls". It
       makes about as much sense as the other meaning without being as
       deadly.

   we can possibly be doing now. Any little bit of smart spending the
   President is proposing is more than cancelled out by spending cuts, the
   now permanent tax cuts for the rich, and the tax increases on the poor
   and middle class that just kicked in.

   from UCLA wrote a tweet that was [444]picked up by Michelle Malkin,
   causing the goons that make up her fanbase to attack my friend on
   Twitter by basically saying/hoping she gets raped.

     So yesterday I tweeted about Gayle Trotter, who testified at the
     Senate hearing on gun control that women need guns to protect
     themselves (presumably because we suck), and today I've had three
     people tweet at me that I'll make a "fine victim", that I'll "just
     be raped" if I don't have a gun because no cop will come (?) and
     that the rapists who "need some lovin tonight" hopefully aren't
     "hunting you easy pieces down." I'm happy for people to disagree
     with me on twitter, but I do wish people would do it without the
     rape fantasies. Grim as fuck.

   So [445]fuck you, Michelle Malkin.  And a Tea Partier I know on
   Facebook responded that because my friend used the word "twat" to
   describe Trotter, that somehow justifies these fuckwads and their rape
   fantasies.

   Part of McCain's problem is probably jealousy. I looked him up on wiki
   and he was elected to Congress in 1982, then the Senate in 1986.

   He's been watching people get nominated for positions all of these
   years, and it is never him (and never will be). Now he has to watch two
   fellow Vietnam vets get State and Defense.

   Chuck Hagel was a Senator for a much shorter time (1997-2009) and he's
   even a Republican nominated by a Democratic president. Bet it chaps
   McCain's already resentful, frustrated and small self.

   That could be why it was so important for McCain to try to get Hagel to
   say McCain was right about the surge. "You may be sitting there as the
   nominee, but I was right and you were wrong. It should be me sitting
   there." That, and because he's a jerk.

       about voting to go to war with Iraq in the first place. And the
       only differnce between the two of them is that Hagel is willing to
       admit he was wrong about Iraq now, McCain still won't do that.

     It took the next questioner, Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of
     Florida, to draw Mr. Hagel out on the subject. "I did question a
     surge," Mr. Hagel said. "I always ask the question, is this going to
     be worth the sacrifice?"

     He said that nearly 1,200 American men and women had lost their
     lives in the surge and that thousands more were wounded. "I'm not
     that certain that it was required," Mr. Hagel said. "Now, it doesn't
     mean I'm right, doesn't mean I didn't make wrong votes."

   These people are not stupid. They know what happens when money is

   by `austerity'). And it ain't jobs for little people, the little people
   will barely be able to afford food and shelter.
   If there ever was a conservative `green' agenda, this is it. Reduce

       Sorry. I don't buy it. Dude knows he's got the ability to
       dramatically shift the political situation when he wants to. Nobody
       living outside the Beltway gives a crap about the debt. Nobody

       Republican voters could easily be made to redirect their anger
       toward their own Party. They hate the idea of cutting earned
       benefits. They complain vigorously when government doesn't provide
       what they expect (aka: is underfunded). They'll never stand for the
       erasure of the tax expenditures workers rely on to make ends meet.
       For all his professed love of Reagan's transformation of the
       American conversation, the President has done nothing to shift the
       political paradigm and redirect the frustration felt across the
       country. His entire strategy for grabbing Republican votes has been

       the numbers the Repukes are shooting for and the Democrats are
       willing to settle for. That's a problem with messaging. The GOP and
       the village idiots have decided the cuts have to be between "X and
       Y billion" where X and Y are different large, positive numbers. We
       don't need cuts we need stimulus. Even that halfhearted stimulus
       from 2009 helped the economy. Why can't anyone, especially from our
       side, get up and scream that from the rafters?
       What's wrong with America? I'll tell you. Everything Romney said
       was pre-chewed wads of cud from Republicans from the last 30 years
       and yet he managed thru a combination of racism and selling the
       (false) hope of riches to get 47% of the national vote.

 The GOP does not have the leverage they threaten ([775]6+ / 0-)

          [780]grover, [781]OLinda

     This reordering, they believe, gives them greater leverage to extort
     deep and unpopular cuts in spending, particularly Medicare, Medicaid
     and Social Security.

   Ezra Klein has written that sequester favors Democrats in negotiations
   more that republicans:
   [782]Republicans think the sequester gives them leverage. They're
   wrong.

     The problem with the GOP's plan to use the sequester as leverage is
     evident as soon as you stop using the vague term "sequester" and
     instead call the policy what it is: A bunch of very dumb -- but
     extremely Democrat-friendly -- spending cuts.

     [snip]
     And so the sequester doesn't touch Medicaid, Social Security or Pell
     grants. It exempts most programs for low-income Americans, like food
     stamps. Veteran's benefits are home free, as are federal retirement
     benefits. Medicare providers see cuts, but Medicare beneficiaries
     don't. And fully half of the cuts come from the military -- a huge
     reduction in defense spending that Democrats couldn't dream about
     achieving any other way.

     That's not to say Democrats will love the sequester. It slashes deep
     into everything from the National Institutes of Health to the Office
     of Vocational and Adult Education to the Environmental Protection
     Agency. Worse, the cuts are done with a cleaver rather than a
     scalpel. Rather than giving agencies control over how to apportion
     the spending cuts, every affected program simply sees the same
     reduction. Democrats don't much like that, but given the sequester's
     disproportionate focus on the military, it's even worse for
     Republicans.

     "Both parties dislike the sequester and they should," says Bob
     Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
     "It's a terrible way to cut budgets. But it's not clear to me why
     Democrats would hate it more and back down first relative to
     Republicans."

     [snip]
     ..they're [GOP] threatening to cut the spending they care most
     deeply about using an unreliable mechanism that was designed to be
     so objectionable that they'd never let it become law.
     But this is the corner they've backed themselves into. Having lost
     an election, and having tied themselves to a no-tax pledge, they're
     so desperate for leverage, so desperate for a hostage they can
     actually shoot, that they're willing to point the gun at their own
     head and threaten to pull the trigger.

   Democrats shouldn't buy into the false meme republicans are putting out
   that they (republicans) have another weapon against Dems - they don't
   and Dems have an opportunity to negotiate accordingly from this
   stronger position.

   Iow's there is zero room or reason for Dems to accept the predictable
   call from the GOP for austerty in any negotiations imo

   Hold as tough as nails against McConnell/Boehner and the teabags - it
   will cost the them when they are forced to advocate for the only cuts
   they really care about - alone

     Islamist insurgents retreating from the ancient Saharan city of
     Timbuktu have set fire to a library containing thousands of
     priceless ancient manuscripts, some dating back to the 13th century,
     in what the town's mayor described as a "devastating blow" to world

   via [855]Examiner.com:

     Conservatives fed up with what they see as a deliberate effort by
     Facebook to censor their content are set to officially launch the
     Tea Party Community, a conservative alternative to Facebook

     Co-founder Ken Crow described the site as a "safe haven" where
     conservatives can share ideas and connect with like-minded people
     who are tired of Facebook's constant badgering and warnings.

   Can you say echo chamber? I love this, let them harrumph to their
   hearts' content. Assuming they have hearts and could ever be content.

   One more gem from the article:

     Worse yet, Facebook allows sites like "I hate it when I wake up and
     Sarah Palin is still alive" while blocking or banning conservative
     sites, causing many to believe the social media site has a double
     standard with regard to political content.

   Of course, a simple web search for "facebook" and "conservative" puts
   lie to the notion that facebook discourages conservative views.

   What they are really peeved about is being called out on their idiocy
   by reasonable folks so they're taking their football and going "home".

   Cool.

   folks buy into the cult of growth?

   I mean, I understand that more growth now means less deprivation now,
   and I understand it in a visceral way.  But every one of these dollars
   we raise in growth now is another inch of sea level rise and resource
   depletion in the future.

   Even people who know that growth is bad for the future tout growth as a
   good thing.

       says next to nothing about whether the quality of life has
       improved.
       If your neighbor the carpenter burns down your uninsured shed and
       you unwittingly hire him to build you a new place to stash your
       lawn mower, that's growth.
       Ditto when your Dell performs to its specifications and
       self-destructs ten days after the warranty expires. Dude, You're
       Getting a Dell! More growth.
       Buying electricity generated by coal? Double growth! Once for your
       electric bill, of course, but don't forget how much you're
       contributing to economic growth when your kid needs an inhaler!

 Comprehensive Sex Education at church! ([889]0+ / 0-)

   My UU church offers a comprehensive sex ed course for 4 age groups and
   also one for adults. The program is called "Our whole Lives", or "OWL"
   and my teen is taking the late middle school-early high school course,
   which is 44 hours.

   [890]http://en.wikipedia.org/...

   The UU and UCC churches developed this program to counter the lack of
   ed kids get in school. The schools offer just biological reproduction
   with a dose of abstinence.

   The program is available in both secular and religious versions. My kid
   is taking the secular version (at church), which is still heavy on
   information and values.

   This is one great program!
