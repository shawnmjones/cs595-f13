   Thomas Perez delivers remarks after President Barack Obama announced
   Perez as his nominee for Labor Secretary, in the East Room of the White
   House, March 18, 2013.
   President Obama and Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez
   "America is what it is today because workers began to organize--to
   demand fair pay, decent hours, safe working conditions, and the dignity
   of a secure retirement," President Obama said in a Labor Day
   proclamation (the full text of which is below the fold). "Through
   decades upon decades of struggle, they won many of the rights and
   benefits we too often take for granted today, from the 40-hour work
   week and minimum wage to safety standards, workers' compensation, and
   health insurance. These basic protections allowed the middle class to
   flourish. They formed the basis of the American dream and offered a
   better life to anyone willing to work for it."

   Yet despite that invocation of organizing and struggle, the president's
   proclamation nowhere uses the word "union," a word also missing from
   his [30]weekly address celebrating working Americans. It's an important
   step--a hugely important step--to, as Obama did in this proclamation,
   say that "I will continue to support collective bargaining rights that
   strengthen the middle class and give voice to workers across our
   Nation." And to call for an increase in the minimum wage.

   But let's just say it: Unions fought for the 40-hour week, safety
   standards, and the rest of it. And they still fight today.

   (Full proclamation text below the fold.)

                               THE WHITE HOUSE
                        Office of the Press Secretary
                    For Immediate Release August 30, 2013
                               LABOR DAY, 2013
                                - - - - - - -
              BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
                               A PROCLAMATION

   On September 5, 1882, in what is thought to be the first Labor Day
   event, thousands of working Americans gathered to march in a New York
   City parade. In the 131 years since, America has called on our workers
   time and again -- to raise and connect our cities; to feed, heal, and
   educate our Nation; to forge the latest technological revolution. On
   Labor Day, we celebrate these enduring contributions and honor all the
   men and women who make up the world's greatest workforce.

   America is what it is today because workers began to organize -- to
   demand fair pay, decent hours, safe working conditions, and the dignity
   of a secure retirement. Through decades upon decades of struggle, they
   won many of the rights and benefits we too often take for granted
   today, from the 40-hour work week and minimum wage to safety standards,
   workers' compensation, and health insurance. These basic protections
   allowed the middle class to flourish. They formed the basis of the
   American dream and offered a better life to anyone willing to work for
   it.

   Yet over the past decades, that promise began to erode. People were
   working harder for less, and good jobs became more difficult to find.
   My Administration remains committed to restoring the basic bargain at
   the heart of the American story. We are bringing good jobs back to the
   United States. We are expanding programs that train workers in
   tomorrow's industries, and we eliminated tax breaks that benefited the
   wealthiest Americans at the expense of the middle class. In the years
   to come, I will continue to support collective bargaining rights that
   strengthen the middle class and give voice to workers across our
   Nation. And I will keep pushing for a higher minimum wage -- because in
   America, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty.

   Thanks to the grit and resilience of the American worker, we have
   cleared away the rubble of the worst recession since the Great
   Depression. Now is the time to reward that hard work. Today, as America
   celebrates working people everywhere, we unite behind good jobs in
   growing industries, and we strengthen our resolve to rebuild our
   economy on a stronger foundation.

   NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of
   America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
   and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2,
   2013, as Labor Day. I call upon all public officials and people of the
   United States to observe this day with appropriate programs,
   ceremonies, and activities that honor the contributions and resilience
   of working Americans.

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this
   thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand thirteen,
   and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
   and thirty-eighth.
   BARACK OBAMA

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       any holiday to bring thoughts of the Haymarket Massacre to mind.
       Even then, the scary Commies were in the minds of the 1%ers.
       "Wouldn't be prudent" to celebrate a holiday that might make
       martyrs out of workers who were standing up for their rights and
       got killed for it.
       Should be May 1.

       make up your mind, Sec'ty Perez.
       Once upon a time, Labor was what it was all about; the core of the
       Democratic Party.  Kossaks, with a few exceptions,  are shockingly,
       and stupidly, mostly indifferent to Labor issues.
       The Oligarch chuckles,  on his way to the bank.  He instructs his
       Minions to toss the Serfs a few social issue successes while
       stirring the pot to keep us all fighting over which is Teh Most

       Obama deep sixed the Employee Free Choice Act in 2009 and did not
       propose any increases in the minimum wage during the 2 years the
       Dems held both houses of Congress. He continues supporting trade
       agreements that ship jobs overseas and never bothered to confront
       China about their currency manipulations. Obama is not a friend of
       working Americans by his own actions.

       Most Americans are very ignorant of the labor movement--of labor
       heroes--of union fights and victories.  If "our" president refuses
       to boast about the accomplishments of unions--I'm not to be
       included in calling him "our."  Unions are not only not feared,
       they're not even respected by the politician they worked so hard to
       elect.

       the conversation is changed to "union thugs" and stories begin with
       "I remember when these union bosses tried to tell me where and when
       I could build thus and so".  Whether or not the anecdotes are true
       (and they might have been when they happened 50, 80 or 100 years
       ago) nothing positive is allowed to be said about Unions or labor
       rights.  If something commendable is said, the subject is changed
       yet again and the volume of the anecdote teller gets louder and
       louder.  That's how cons and pubs battle facts:  with anecdotes and
       stories from long ago.  The end result is the narrative that the
       labor movement is run by thugs and the mob, which is reinforced by
       the media and thus becomes the truth to most people.

       What I have seen is, except in rare cases (SB 5 in OH), unions

       if they do anymore than token resistance, then the right/media

       I haven't been happy with my union (UAW) since they allowed the
       execrable tiered wage scale in the early 2000's. Backed right down
       on that one and threw new hires under the bus. They barely put up
       any fight to snyder and his ilk, either.  I don't know the answer,
       but they're still better than the forces they're up against, who
       manage to thrive and get wealthy in spite of the recession they
       caused (and are still given more honor as a profession than
       workers).
       I hope more of them grow spines for the sake of the workforce.
       Trumka should be up on a soapbox about the non use of the word
       Union in this speech, for example.  All Union leaders and member
       should let the President know they noticed this slight in a loud
       tone of voice.  That would be a start.  Words are important.

 But the President did boast. ([374]0+ / 0-)

   I'm not sure what you mean about Obama refusing to "boast about the
   accomplishments of unions." Did you not read the statement? I'll paste
   it here so you can see his boasting about organized labor (which
   everyone knows is a synonym for unions):

   "America is what it is today because workers began to organize -- to
   demand fair pay, decent hours, safe working conditions, and the dignity
   of a secure retirement. Through decades upon decades of struggle, they
   won many of the rights and benefits we too often take for granted
   today, from the 40-hour work week and minimum wage to safety standards,
   workers' compensation, and health insurance. These basic protections
   allowed the middle class to flourish. They formed the basis of the
   American dream and offered a better life to anyone willing to work for
   it."

   Great boasting! It's good to have an ally in the White House who
   recognizes how much has been won by unions like he did right there in
   that statement. Maybe you're too eager to be disappointed?

       extinction. Obama only listens to the 1%. (Yeah, for the record he

       You realize this thread is full of people attacking him over
       nothing but his word choice? I guess we agree that it's silly
       nitpicking and actions are what count.
       The big disappointment of Obama's first term was the failure to
       pass a good bill to protect the right to organize. But, I think you
       have to blame Reid and conservative Senate Democrats.
       Health care is the biggest advancement for workers in a generation.
       I remember people around here complaining when Obama made a deal to
       extend unemployment benefits but that was important to a lot of
       people. The stimulus bill was full of benefits for the middle
       class. He appointed pro-labor people with support from the AFL-CIO
       to the labor relations board, which makes a big difference.
       Yeah, you can rattle off all the usual gripes about who got
       appointed to what and tax cuts in the stimulus. But, he has still
       done a lot for the middle class. The gripes don't make the good
       things disappear. Yeah, actions matter and a bad Congress is the
       only reason his good actions aren't even better.

       I believe you are right that the failure of EFCA should not be
       pinned on Obama, but on weak-kneed Senate Democrats.
       I've studied the press reports from 2009-2010 and it is clear
       Democrats never had the necessary 60 votes to pass even the
       watered-down EFCA promoted by Arlen Spector. In fact, it not at all
       clear that they ever had a firm 51 votes to pass it, had Reid be
       willing to force a showdown on the Republican filibustering.
       The terrible Blanche Lincoln has already paid a price for
       collapsing on the EFCA issues. Others -- Feinstein, Landreiu,
       Warner, Pryor, etc. -- need to be punished as well.

          But once it looked like EFCA had a real chance to pass, a
       handful of "Democrats" began to waver in their support of the
       legislation.
          It was safe to be all for EFCA as long as it had no chance of
       passing. If anything exposed the blue dogs for the craven phonies
       they are, it was the EFCA saga.
          But, of course, as Blanche Lincoln will tell you, withdrawing
       support from EFCA was critical to get her re-elected in a red

   Don't be distracted by what people say.
   Look at what they do.

   I just don't see working conditions on the front burner with this
   administration.

   The economy won't be fixed by more education. The problem is with the
   increasing concentration of wealth at the top and the resulting lack of
   demand from the rest of us who are facing increasingly precarious
   futures.

   A strong labor movement -- a prevailing force against the concentration
   of wealth at the top -- is an important part of a healthy economy.

   History tells us this. Economics tells us the same thing.

   I don't see this administration doing much about it, though, other than
   the occasional speech.

       it's OK to bring up unions on Labor Day and that it's also
       acceptable to note when a Democratic President doesn't mention them
       at all in his proclamation. As someone else pointed out here, while
       the current strikes by non-unionized minimum wage food service
       employees is awesome and vitally important to the future of the
       labor movement, organized labor must continue to play a central
       part in keeping workers safe, happy, and well-compensated. Mr.
       Obama's not mentioning unions- by name- is noteworthy.

       matters is that we debate about what's more or less "noteworthy".
       It's Labor Day, an authentically historical momentous day to
       celebrate and honor the heroic and tangible fruits of American
       labor and organizing. Not Obama's WH weekly press release.

   I don't give a fuck about the past or what the President says or
   doesn't say. He's not important here.

   The sooner workers and intellectuals stop caring so much about the
   President and the distractions du jour the people can organize around
   people's self interests today and tomorrow.

   That's not going to look anything like unions or any other industrial
   era anachronistic action or movement.

   You want strikes and a thousand different contract renewal dates and
   union organizations, and a little higher fucking minimum wage?

   Wake up and forget about Obama and the next President and the next. The
   Millenials size is one of the last assets to leverage to architect a
   modern national benefit structure and have time to make it happen.

   I was in Germany Sept. 2009 and was talking with a guy in a restaurant.
   He asked me what I thought of Obama. I said, "Well, I think he is a
   cautious politician." I brought up his handling of health insurance
   reform, where I thought he was deferring to Congress. The German guy
   had been in the States, but we did not go further on the topic of
   health insurance, so I suppose he had not kept up with it.

   I'm listening to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation right now where
   they have been talking about the formation of a NEW labor union. The
   union's first President is talking- without interruption by the
   newsperson- about how the union will fight to prevent the "continued
   race to the bottom in the private sector."

   This, incidentally, is on the national news broadcast at the top of the
   hour, not a specialized Commie show. That means everyone listening to
   the news, including in the right-wing prairie provinces, is being
   educated about the continued presence of labor unions in their country.
