[71]Polls give edge to backers of gay marriage

The majority of Mainers favor the Nov. 6 ballot initiative, but the number of
undecided voters points to 'a very close race,' one pollster says.

   By SUSAN M. COVER MaineToday Media

   AUGUSTA - New polls indicate that the majority of Maine voters support
   the proposal on November's ballot to legalize same-sex marriage, but
   the gap is narrow enough for one of the pollsters to predict "a very
   close race."

   [73]Will Mainers pass the November ballot inititiative legalizing
   same-sex marriage?
   ([74]polls)

   Public Policy Polling released results Thursday that show 52 percent of
   likely voters support the proposal, 44 percent oppose it and 4 percent
   are undecided.

   Also Thursday, the Maine People's Resource Center released a poll that
   shows 53 percent support, 43 percent oppose and 4 percent are undecided
   on Question 1 on the Nov. 6 ballot.

   "Our experience in polling gay marriage is that if people say they're
   undecided, it usually means they're opposed to it," said Dean Debnam,
   president of Public Policy Polling, in a prepared statement. "Despite
   the 8-point lead for passage, this should be seen as a very close
   race."

   Jim Melcher, a political science professor at the University of Maine
   at Farmington, agreed with Debnam.

   "There's a lot of 'I'm kind of for it but I'm a little uneasy too,'" he
   said.

   Mainers United for Marriage, the leading advocate for legalizing gay
   marriage, said it is pleased to see a majority of Mainers continuing to
   support gay marriage.

   "There's no question this is going to be a highly contested election,"
   said David Farmer, spokesman for Mainers United for Marriage. "All the
   polling shows a clear majority of folks supporting marriage, which is
   good news."

   Opponents also are heartened by the results.

   "We are encouraged by this, but it's still going to take a tremendous
   effort," said Carroll Conley of Protect Marriage Maine, the leading
   opponent of the ballot proposal. "The other side has been thorough."

   A poll commissioned by the Portland Press Herald in June showed 57
   percent of respondents supported gay marriage, 35 percent opposed it
   and 8 percent were undecided.

   Both sides said they expect to see the numbers vary from poll to poll.
   Farmer said differing methodologies, particularly in the way the
   question is worded, affect the results from one poll to the next.

   Also, both sides noted that polls are snapshots in time and don't
   predict the outcome on Election Day.

   Historically, poll results on same-sex marriage have varied, even just
   before the election.

   One week before Mainers voted to repeal the state's same-sex marriage
   law in 2009, Pan Atlantic SMS Group of Portland released poll results
   that showed 53 percent supported gay marriage, 42 percent opposed it
   and 6 percent were undecided.

   However, Public Policy Polling results released a week earlier had
   shown a dead heat -- 48 percent to 48 percent, with 4 percent
   undecided.

   Ultimately, voters rejected gay marriage, 53 percent to 47 percent.

   Public Policy Polling, a firm in Raleigh, N.C., is used frequently by
   Democrats. It surveyed 804 likely Maine voters on Sept. 17 and 18,
   asking: "Question 1 would allow the state of Maine to issue marriage
   licenses to same-sex couples. If the election was today, would you vote
   yes or no on Question 1?"

   As a follow-up, respondents were asked if same-sex marriage should be
   legal or illegal. Fifty-two percent said legal, 40 percent said illegal
   and 8 percent were unsure.

   The poll's margin of error was 3.5 percentage points.

   The Maine People's Resource Center, affiliated with the liberal
   advocacy group the Maine People's Alliance, conducted its poll Sept. 15
   through Sept. 17.

   It became the first pollster to ask Mainers the question that will
   appear on the ballot: "If there were a referendum held today that asked
   'Do you want to allow the state of Maine to issue marriage licenses to
   same-sex couples,' how would you vote?"
