Utah Democrats call for more protected public land, slowly

   Jeff C/Sierra Club

   One of the more sublime locations on the planet is the 1.4 million acre
   [3]Greater Canyonlands in southern Utah, a place that inspires fierce
   protective feelings amongst those who don't want gas, oil, tar sands,
   or uranium companies to set up shop there.

   [4]Environmental groups like the [5]Sierra Club and outdoor related
   [6]businesses would like President Obama to invoke [7]the Antiquities
   Act of 1906 and, with one [8]Teddy Roosevelt-like stroke of the pen,
   proclaim Greater Canyonlands a national monument  This group includes
   [9]Aron Ralston of [10]127 Hours fame, the adventurer who amputated his
   own arm after being trapped for six days in one of those canyons. He
   [11]writes:

     In doing so, [President Obama] will save the region from imminent
     degradation and allow others the chance to hoot, yell, and holler --
     feeling most alive -- as they create stories among the sensual
     orange canyons, frog-lined pools, and split-crack spires of the
     red-rock.

   A more measured approach is being proposed by Utah Democrats who
   [12]gathered on the steps of the capitol in Salt Lake City yesterday.
   They have drafted a joint [13]resolution calling for the protection of
   Greater Canyonlands, but rather than calling for the [14]Antiquities
   Act, they want lots of public input, plus facts and statistics.

     __________________________________________________________________


   According to the Salt Lake City [15]Tribune, their resolution "seems
   tailored to avoid the kind of political blowback that arose with
   President Bill Clinton's 1996 designation of the Grand
   Staircase-Escalante National Monument."

   And boy, was there blowback. President Clinton's decision, made at a
   [16]ceremony at the rim of the Grand Canyon, enraged [17]mining
   interests and conservatives and led Utah's Republican Senator Orin
   Hatch to [18]call it the "mother of all land grabs."

   Acknowledging the deep-red conservatism of Utah, and hoping to head off
   a similar firestorm for President Obama over Canyonlands, resolution
   sponsor Senator Jim Dabakis said:

     "We hope to bring a calm, rational, productive and civil discussion
     full of facts and figures about what should be protected as the
     premier recreational lands in the United States. It's a great
     treasure we have been given stewardship over. We are open to what
     kind protections should be built."

   A calm, rational discussion over unspoiled Western lands? Here's
   hoping.

   I expect the same response that we get when Warren Buffet calls for
   increased taxes on billionaires:

   "There's nothing to stop you from buying it yourself and setting up a
   foundation to keep it the way you like it."

   And the opil, gas and uranium industries are going to just go along
   without problems, right?

   The big problem with the West (said as one who grew up there) is
   Westerners, who can't see beyond the end of their noses and would
   happily kill grandma if there was a penny's profit in the act.

   Seems like most of those bankers were similarly motivated to those
   extremes that caused the collapse in 2008 were on the east coast.
   Profiteers are the same no matter where they are from.

   it is the objective of all such repuber PRIVATEERS to get onb board
   with bankster thieves to implement debt cash flow in return for placing
   public property in hock so that they can foreclose on it to steal it.
   This path is clear.

     The game of loan-pricejack-loan-biggerdebt-foreclose is a very
     predictable and obvious game.

   Cap'n Mitt was their Cayman ship raider who tried to get elected to
   steal lands and homes for certain thieves outside the U.S. Even though
   he did not win, his operation and crew of thieves are still in place
   and running a FORM vs SUSBSTANCE tax swindle against the people of the
   U.S. Their ambition to steal will never never end until such law that
   makes the attempts to destroy democracy and take public lands a capital
   crime.

   Hey Utah, while you're at it, how about giving back Indian treaty land
   that's been stolen!

   The Ute will be happy to give you a map. Free!

   It's already a hopeless cause...Calm, rational, productive along with
   facts & figures - are not something the GOTP does.....

   Calm, rational, productive, with the Utah Republicans? I have to say I
   have always something mentally deficient in a Democrat who was willing
   to live in Utah of all places.

   Strictly an accident of birth, I assure you, and it took me forty years
   to get past the Republican brainwashing that is epidemic here...

   "Radical environmentalists" is one of Orrin Hatch's favorite ways of
   swearing...

   I know and love the canyons of Southern Utah having returned to them
   again and again my entire adult life. While it is an unutterably
   beautiful landscape, it is incredibly fragile as well. A single hiker,
   cutting across the land can leave bootprints in some places that will
   last for months, or even years.

   In the coming months, we will not only hear about "land grabs," jobs,
   and State's rights, but we will hear the apparent softer sounds of
   "environmentally sensitive mining techniques" and "low-impact
   drilling." They are all lies. You cannot have a mine, or well or road
   in this land without having a huge impact on the ecosystem. The water
   that is the lifeblood of the land is so easy to pollute. The air that
   is the cleanest in the lower 48 will lose its unbelievable blue
   brightness. The plants and animals that live in one of the harshest
   environments in the Country will disappear. And the jobs that the
   Utahns will hear about will rob them of their ways of living and will
   leave when the coal and oil and uranium are gone, leaving nothing but
   wreckage behind.

   I have much the same fears about western North Dakota. I moved away a
   long time ago, and was back there last summer. It was deeply disturbing
   about just how much Williston had changed, from being a sleepy little
   farming town to a stinking, crowded, rude town. Reminded me of Texas,
   really. The pollution is just awful and you can't get away from it. And
   these were promised to be clean extraction wells. Yeah, right!

   >A calm, rational discussion over unspoiled Western lands...

   That won't happen here, alas, but I salute you, Kent, for bringing some
   publicity to this subject. Lord knows how many of us have burned
   ourselves out with righteous indignation trying to help set aside as
   much wilderness as possible while the developers in the Legislature
   work to thwart every move; besides the extensive red rock areas south
   of here, the High Unitas Primitive Area to the east--which is connected
   by a "land corridor" to Yellowstone and the Jackson Hole area--remains
   essentially unspoiled, but exists as a sore spot among the "anti
   gubm'nt" crowd. They are angry at any restrictions being placed on
   their "right" to take SUV's and ATV's wherever they want. Their
   attitudes on that subject are identical with their views on firearms.

   It's a magnificent area that needs protection, and it already belongs
   to the people of the United States because it's federal land. I first
   went there in 1963 to work on a range research project. The state
   legislators have a good idea, but they're going to need a lot of help
   to overcome the opposition of county commissioners who act as if they
   own it. We can all help by signing the petition.
