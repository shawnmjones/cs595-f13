[68]Bon Jovi to NJ: I'll be there for you

   (CNN) - Rock star and New Jersey native Jon Bon Jovi made an appearance
   Monday to announce his $1 million contribution to New Jersey's Sandy
   Relief Fund.

   "My being here is not political. It's emotional because I grew up here.
   I went to school here. I met my wife here," he said at an event held to
   announce the donation. "And in the days following the storm, when I
   visited these streets and spoke to the residents, one thought that came
   to me time and time again was what can I do?"
   Beaming with pride, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Bon Jovi and
   his wife are people "who never take New Jersey away from themselves."

   "They always have New Jersey as part of who they are and in their
   heart," the Republican governor said.

   Before the announcement, Bon Jovi walked through his hometown of
   Sayreville with Christie to meet with residents affected by the October
   storm that wreaked havoc on the New Jersey shoreline.

   "I know that this million dollars sounds like a lot but it's really
   just a drop in the bucket," Bon Jovi said. "What I like to call the
   'power of we,' the coming together-that means you, me, us-we are taking
   a step today to rebuild lives."

   He presented the check to Christie's wife, Mary Pat, who heads up the
   relief fund where Bon Jovi and fellow rock legends Bruce Springsteen
   and Bono serve as honorary board members.

   Since the hurricane, the fund has raised more than $38 million from
   29,000 people, Mary Pat Christie said at the event.

   Christie, the face of the Superstorm Sandy recovery effort in New
   Jersey, has teamed up with Bon Jovi in the past. The musician
   [70]appeared at the governor's bill signing in April for a law that
   encourages people to report drug overdoses without fear of being
   arrested.

       The GOP always talks about the entertainment industry and the
       people in it as somehow "evil".........but when the chips are down,
       many people from that industry step up big time to help. Bon Jovi
       is just the latest one to do it. Good for him!

    2. Government waste rules
       They should have gotten Bon Jovi to write a song for NJ. That awful
       "Stronger than the Storm" tune is on TV non stop and it SUCKS
       BEYOND ALL COMPREHENSION.

       Didn't they kick Christie out of the GOP for his man love of Obama?
       Rush said he wasn't a real republican and gay.

       Did Springsteen kick in a few million? Where are all those rich New
       Yorkers. Time to shake them down as well.

       "They should have gotten Bon Jovi to write a song for NJ"
       It would be really cool if he wrote a whole album.
       And called it "New Jersey"

       It's the least he can do. He owns a mansion in NJ and pays no
       property tax. None. I have a modest home and pay 11,000 a year in
       taxes and I am far from rich. The middle class are the ones that
       pay the burden in this country. It's sad!

       Kudos to Bon Jovi. He is more dedicated to NJ than the POTUS.

       Let the right wing, hate mongers start their banter now. The
       fastest and the loudest among us to judge. And the weakest among us
       to agree with their tirades. There's always going to be three dogs,
       and one with a bone the other two are trying to get. So let the
       squabble begin. The start will more than likely come from one of
       the great AM radio parrots, with the flock close behind.

       Small drop in the bucket considering all the money he saved in mega
       rich man tax loopholes. He should donate a lot more than that. It's
       rather disgusting what that man gets away with.

       Lohan and Bynes are poor examples for anyone but Bon Jovi has the
       right attitute. Good for him indeed. You realize your 1st sentence
       is a blanket statement and blanket statements are hardly ever true!

       The treatment of Christie by SOME in the GOP is pathetic, he is
       doing the job folks in Jersey elected him to do and that is to take
       care of his state. He expressed his appreciation to the president
       for federal support after Sandy! I like the guy!

       Bon Jovi said this was not poltical, so why are you trying to
       making as such? His time, His effort, His money, His state. NOTHING
       political about that!

       It's easy to say "we are stronger than the storm" when the tax
       payers from all over the country paid for the cleanup

       Exactly, there are GOPers who complain every time Obama is in a
       photo op with a celebrity and says hes "too hollywood" yet they
       seem to forget one thing. Their most prized President, Ronald
       Reagan was in movies, radio, television shows, etc. GOP the party
       of contradiction
       _________________________________________
       The only problem with your statement is Reagan was not president
       when he made movies!

       Alright CNN (or Ashley), you reported on Bon Jovi's $1M largesse to
       NJ and his emotional ties to the state. You reported on other
       celebrities with similar NJ ties and their donations to the Sandy
       Relief Fund. Is it really necessary to end the report with Bon
       Jovi's daughter's drug overdose? What has that got to do with
       anything in your report? It just reflects so badly on media reports
       unnecessary penchange for controversy.
       July 8, 2013 02:12 pm at 2:12 pm |
   24. Ron
       I meant penchant, not penchange
