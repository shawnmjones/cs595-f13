[22]Public still divided, uninformed about Affordable Care Act

   This week marks the [29]third anniversary of the Affordable Care Act
   being signed into law, and the latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll
   shows that the majority of Americans [30]still don't know what in the
   hell it does, and still think it does things it doesn't. And a
   plurality still doesn't like it.
   Chart showing favorability of ACA over time since 2010.
   The law hasn't gained in popularity, with 37 percent of respondents
   viewing it favorably and 40 percent unfavorably. They don't like it,
   even though they don't know what it does: 57 percent say they don't
   know enough about it to understand how it might affect their own health
   insurance. This is the ongoing challenge of the Obama administration:
   providing public education and, yes, public relations, to help ensure
   the success of the exchanges. Fully two-thirds of the group the law is
   intended to help the most--the uninsured and those making less than
   $40,000 a year are the ones who say they are least knowledgable about
   the law
   Chart showing percentages of various groups' understanding of what's in
   the ACA
   Finally, there's the large numbers of people who think the law does
   exactly what it doesn't. Almost 60 percent think the law has a public
   option; nearly half (47 percent) think it will provide government
   subsidies to undocumented immigrants to buy insurance; and, yes, 40
   percent (and 35 percent of seniors) think it sets up government death
   panels (21 percent aren't sure on that one).

   The bright side of this is that there are some very popular provisions
   of the bill that people don't yet know are in it. For example, tax
   credits to small businesses that offer health insurance, which 88
   percent of respondents think is a great idea, but only 52 percent knew
   was in the law. Eighty-one percent of people think the Medicare donut
   hole should be closed, and only 46 percent knew it's in the law. The
   idea of a health insurance exchange is popular with 80 percent of
   respondents, but only 58 percent know they are coming. As these things
   come on line, the law will become more popular. But it won't happen
   without an organized, effective and well-publicized campaign by the
   administration.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,

   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these

       It's really the job of the Administration and the democrats to
       inform everyone of the ACA provisions if for no other reason than
       to counteract the very visible GOP public relations against ACA.
       It's almost as if Obama and the Democrats are taking the public and
       the possibility that they'll eventually "get it" for granted.

       A messy compromise, yes.
       Still better than the previous status quo, by light-years.
       Among other things, they have turned health insurance into a
       tightly control utility market, with rather modest limits on profit
       margins.
       Oh yeah, and its major funding? [127]taxes on the rich:

     PPACA's provisions are funded by a variety of taxes and offsets.
     Major sources of new revenue include a much-broadened Medicare tax
     on incomes over $200,000 and $250,000, for individual and joint
     filers respectively, an annual fee on insurance providers, and a 40%
     excise tax on "Cadillac" insurance policies.

       bargained the so-called Cadillac plans in lieu of their actual
       wages.  So, it is definitely a 'pay cut,' in a collective
       bargaining situation.
       I'd say that it's not being touted by the Administration because
       they understand that while it may provide some degree of health
       care, it will also put a tremendous financial hardship on millions
       of low income Americans.
       As one 34-page policy analysis says:

     What this means is that those Americans with the least or no
     disposable income are faced in effect with a substantial pay cut.

     The author provides an example of a 35 year-old with a MAGI of
     $27,925. The out-of- pocket cost to this person of a Silver level
     plan (second least expensive) is $187.33 per month.  The coverage
     under the less expensive Sliver plan is only 70/30 coverage.
     This cost [of the health exchange premiums] is based on pre-tax
     income, that is, before income is reduced by payroll and income
     taxes.
     There goes the car payment or utility bill.
     The lives of millions of Americans will change drastically as they
     struggle with a new, large expense - particularly in an era of no
     jobs, low-paying jobs and rising cost of living.
       In the several years since the ACA passed, I've always expressed
       concern about the puny subsidies.
       They aren't near large enough, and they should extend to folks
       considerably higher up the income scale than they do.  The cut off
       is definitely in 'working class'  territory.
       I would prefer a public option plan, but would have less of a
       problem with the ACA, if it were to be appropriately and
       sufficiently subsidized.
       Oh, and there's ANOTHER glitch.

     Obamacare 'Glitch' Allows Some Families To Be Priced Out Of Health
     Insurance

     By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR 01/30/13 09:55 PM ET EST AP
     WASHINGTON -- Some families could get priced out of health insurance
     due to what's being called a glitch in President Barack Obama's
     overhaul law. IRS regulations issued Wednesday failed to fix the
     problem as liberal backers of the president's plan had hoped.
     As a result, some families that can't afford the employer coverage
     that they are offered on the job will not be able to get financial
     assistance from the government to buy private health insurance on
     their own. How many people will be affected is unclear.
       And last, but not least, there are the millions who will be fined,
       because they simply cannot afford the premiums, period (subsidized
       or not).  Let's not forget that millions and millions of Americans
       (a third is what I often see quoted) are 'underwater' in mortgages,
       and barely hanging on.
       Then there's the millions already foreclosed upon, who certainly
       are in no position due to job loss, etc., to carry an insurance
       premium.
       And it's some of these poor folks, who will be fined in order to
       help pay [along with other funding sources] for those folks who can
       just manage to eke out a monthly health insurance premium payment.
       We need to demand that our lawmakers get rid of the above "glitch,"
       and properly subsidize the program.
       It's a shame that progressive advocates were not able to persuade
       the PtB to take care of this before its implementation.

       I warned about this while the health insurance debate was going on
       and I kept getting replies that "it will be fixed later".
       Fat chance on having a Republican House fix it later.
       Meanwhile, you're going to hear a lot of middle class people howl
       to holy hell as they react to the sticker shock. I really believe
       that we'll see a rerun of the 1989 fight to kill Medicare

       that's a possibility.
       I would imagine that if enough middle class folks' coverage is
       adversely affected, it could happen.
       Hopefully, the PtB will make needed adjustments.  They could, you
       know.
       Or better yet, if there is serious blowback, maybe they'll just
       relent, and go with Medicare-For-All.
       Won't hold my breath, on that one, though. ;-)

     Among other things, they have turned health insurance into a tightly
     control utility market, with rather modest limits on profit margins.

   Not at all so.

   There is a limit on gross margin from premium income, but that is all,
   overall profit margins aren't addressed. (This may or may not apply
   only to those participating in exchanges, I can no longer recall.)

   Certain base plans must be offered by those participating in exchanges
   (and only those), but other stuff can be offered too, and the premiums
   for said plans is not set.

   In general not so tightly regulated, even for those participating in
   exchanges.

 No, read the whole sentence slowly, it consists ([177]0+ / 0-)
       of more than two words. Insurance companies make very little of
       their net profit from direct insurance, some even lose money from
       insurance operations and are enormously profitable all the same.
       The medical loss ratio might not even apply to income from
       reinsurance, but it definitely doesn't apply to investment and
       other income.

   I don't think there's any conspiracy or plan, they've just moved on to
   other projects.

   The best thing they can do is work hard to stop letting it grow more
   complicated.  There have been too many changes since its passage that
   make it more complex and cause it to provide less coverage to fewer
   people.

   The Medicaid Expansion has become very problematic, hopefully they'll
   take a strong stance against letting red states dismember it.  Sure,
   they're probably sick and tired of dealing with the implementation, but
   it's their job and they need to do it well.

   In the ACA bill, the low income Fed contributions are dependent on

   days to say we don't have available funds.

   Today, kids can stay on parents insurance until 26.

   Pre-existing conditions can't be used as excuse to refuse payment by

   Insurers are limited to their profits, and have to return excess to

   It is the job of the administration to explain in detail how this will
   effect the average American.

   I don't understand why the administration has failed to do this.  At
   this point, the public should be looking forward to 2014, if for no
   other reason, they can get some form of healthcare insurance.

   For example, how many people know they can get a colonoscopy and their
   insurance company will pay 100% NOW?  That includes any procedures that
   need to be done to remove growth/polyps.

   How many women know their current insurance will pay 100% NOW for their
   mammograms?

   How may people know a doctors visit and blood tests done for well care
   is paid 100% NOW by their current insurance?

   And those are just a few of the highlights.

       My point here is the administration can "get it in gear" when it

       The people who came up with this purely political solution didn't
       understand the underlying problem. They thought they could take
       some point between the left and the right and just implement that.
       They don't seem to understand that there's an actual problem that
       needs to be solved, and only a SOLUTION is going to work, not just
       some odd political compromise.
       Only some form of universal, public system is going to be able to
       deliver universal, affordable healthcare. If you push millions of
       people into the for-profit system, all you do is run up costs. But
       this whole thing became a political issue when costs soared over
       15% of GDP. Unless you get the costs down below that (and more
       reasonably down to about 12% or less) the political problem doesn't
       go away because the economic problem doesn't go away.
       This excess cost is eating into the other sectors--food, clothing,
       transportation, housing--and holding back the recovery. And, it's
       an excess burden on our exports. So, of course, people still want
       single-payer--because they want an actual, working solution.

   Pardon me, I know that sounds like the endless loud exaggerations about

   But I caught a couple minutes of Melissa Harris-Perry this AM and they
   were discussing the implementation of the exchanges.
   MHP held up and asked about the 23 page application. She said she knew
   he'd said only parts of it applied to any particular person but wasn't
   there a better way to get this out?
   The guy (evidently a spokesman for program) said most people would just
   apply on-line and that was a lot simpler.

   MHP said this could all be avoided with Medicare for all or single
   payer

   Then I had to leave.

   I assume it is easier on line because the paper app would ask a
   question and then "If yes, continue" and "If no go to page 17" or
   whatever
   But my heart sank at the thought of that 23 page application. It will

       Many people give up even trying to register just our of sheer

       Yet you can't get people in our headquarters and their

       And it sure is funny that when Medicare was implemented in 1966,
       all people had to do was sign a card if they didn't want to be
       enrolled. A single card. Not a 23 page form that no matter how out

     Great post John. Its simple to get universal coverage through
     reconciliation, just expand the eligibility of Medicare. It could be
     paid for by uncapping FICA caps on Social Security (Medicare taxes
     are already uncapped) and raising the FICA rate enough to make the
     deal revenue neutral.
     I've read that there's Senate parliamentarian precedent that
     changing the age requirements is "incidental to the budget" so can
     be kicked out of Reconciliation via the Byrd Rule. However, there's
     another to expand eligibility, and that's to change the Code section
     that Nixon signed into law granting coverage to the permanently
     disabled, 42 US Code 7 §1395c(2)- It currently reads:
     individuals under age 65 who have been entitled for not less than 24
     months to benefits under subchapter II of this chapter (or would
     have been so entitled to such benefits if certain government
     employment were covered employment under such subchapter) or under
     the railroad retirement system on the basis of a disability...
     But this Code section would cover every citizen and permanent
     resident if amended to:
     individuals under age 65 entitled to a Social Security Account
     Number under subchapter II of this chapter.

     The amended code section could read more simply as, "individuals
     under 65 entitled to a Social Security Account Number". The
     reference to "subchapter ii" is unnecessary (see 42 US Code 7
     §405c(2) "wage records").

     Feel free to steal any or all of this, if you wish. I'm a government
     contractor, so its not something I can really blog about openly ) -

       This is an idea that seems to cut through all the parliamentary
       stuff going straight to single payer

   We pay over 17% of GDP for our broken system. Sensible countries in
   Europe pay between 10 and 12%, and get better outcomes. We have to
   compete with these people, but our healthcare system is undermining us
   with ridiculous costs.

   Instead, we took a step backward, one guaranteed to increase the amount
   of money going to the healthcare sector without any better quality.

   The Administration simply gave up on getting an actual solution to the
   problem. They expanded the failed system. Bravo.

       If you decide to do so as well, just read down the section headings
       and maybe the "Sense of the Senate" sections.
       Most of the details read like this kind of crap: "In article 2b,
       section 7, subsection 3a, paragraph 6f, replace semicolon (;) with
       comma (,)."
       And God said, "Let there be light"; and with a Big Bang, there was
       light. And God said "Ow! Ow My eyes!" and in a flash God separated
       light from darkness. "Whew! Now that's better. Now where was I. Oh

       there are bullet points that can be extracted and explained in a
       readable and sensible way. Which could be expostulated on, if the
       Admin had any interest in doing anything other than intensifying
       the process of Inward and Upward Wealth Transfer, and putting in
       place a global set of mechanisms of surveillance and control. In a
       world that you have to wonder, given the other emphasis on stuff
       like "all of the above energy 'policy' (sic)" that will leave a
       planet that even the Elite will find it hard to live on, and
       dumping a quarter of the world's wealth (and steadily increasing)
       into the MIC thing.

        Okay, explained like you're a five year-old (well, okay, maybe a
     bit older), without too much oversimplification, and (hopefully)
     without sounding too biased:

         What people call "Obamacare" is actually the Patient Protection
     and Affordable Care Act. However, people were calling it "Obamacare"
     before everyone even hammered out what it would be. It's a term
     mostly used by people who don't like the PPACA, and it's become
     popularized in part because PPACA is a really long and awkward name,
     even when you turn it into an acronym like that.
         Anyway, the PPACA made a bunch of new rules regarding health
     care, with the purpose of making health care more affordable for
     everyone. Opponents of the PPACA, on the other hand, feel that the
     rules it makes take away too many freedoms and force people (both
     individuals and businesses) to do things they shouldn't have to.
         So what does it do? Well, here is everything, in the order of
     when it goes into effect (because some of it happens later than
     other parts of it):
         (Note: Page numbers listed in citations are the page numbers
     within the actual document, not the page numbers of the PDF file)
         Already in effect:
             It allows the Food and Drug Administration to approve more
     generic drugs (making for more competition in the market to drive
     down prices) ( Citation: An entire section of the bill, called Title
     VII, is devoted to this, starting on page 747 )
             It increases the rebates on drugs people get through
     Medicare (so drugs cost less) ( Citation: Page 216, sec. 2501 )
             It establishes a non-profit group, that the government
     doesn't directly control, PCORI, to study different kinds of
     treatments to see what works better and is the best use of money. (
     Citation: Page 665, sec. 1181)
             It makes chain restaurants like McDonalds display how many
     calories are in all of their foods, so people can have an easier
     time making choices to eat healthy. ( Citation: Page 499, sec. 4205
     )
             It makes a "high-risk pool" for people with pre-existing
     conditions. Basically, this is a way to slowly ease into getting rid
     of "pre-existing conditions" altogether. For now, people who already
     have health issues that would be considered "pre-existing
     conditions" can still get insurance, but at different rates than
     people without them. ( Citation: Page 30, sec. 1101, Page 45, sec.
     2704, and Page 46, sec. 2702 )
             It forbids insurance companies from discriminating based on
     a disability, or because they were the victim of domestic abuse in
     the past (yes, insurers really did deny coverage for that) (
     Citation: Page 47, sec. 2705 )
             It renews some old policies, and calls for the appointment
     of various positions.
             It creates a new 10% tax on indoor tanning booths. (
     Citation: Page 923, sec. 5000B )
             It says that health insurance companies can no longer tell
     customers that they won't get any more coverage because they have
     hit a "lifetime limit". Basically, if someone has paid for health
     insurance, that company can't tell that person that he's used that
     insurance too much throughout his life so they won't cover him any
     more. They can't do this for lifetime spending, and they're limited
     in how much they can do this for yearly spending. ( Citation: Page
     14, sec. 2711 )
             Kids can continue to be covered by their parents' health
     insurance until they're 26. ( Citation: Page 15, sec. 2714 )
             No more "pre-existing conditions" for kids under the age of
     19. ( Citation: Page 45, sec. 2704 and Page 57, sec. 1255 )
             Insurers have less ability to change the amount customers
     have to pay for their plans.
             People in a "Medicare Gap" get a rebate to make up for the
     extra money they would otherwise have to spend. ( Citation: Page
     379, sec. 3301 )
             Insurers can't just drop customers once they get sick. (
     Citation: Page 14, sec. 2712 )
             Insurers have to tell customers what they're spending money
     on. (Instead of just "administrative fee", they have to be more
     specific).
             Insurers need to have an appeals process for when they turn
     down a claim, so customers have some manner of recourse other than a
     lawsuit when they're turned down. ( Citation: Page 42, sec. 2719 )
             Anti-fraud funding is increased and new ways to stop fraud
     are created. ( Citation: Page 699, sec. 6402 )
             Medicare extends to smaller hospitals. ( Citation: Starting
     on page 344, the entire section "Part II" seems to deal with this )
             Medicare patients with chronic illnesses must be monitored
     more thoroughly.
             Reduces the costs for some companies that handle benefits
     for the elderly. ( Citation: Page 492, sec. 4202)
             A new website is made to give people insurance and health
     information. (I think this is it:[494]http://www.healthcare.gov/ ).
     ( Citation: Page 36, sec. 1103 )
             A credit program is made that will make it easier for
     business to invest in new ways to treat illness by paying half the
     cost of the investment. (Note - this program was temporary. It
     already ended) ( Citation: Page 830, sec. 9023 )
             A limit is placed on just how much of a percentage of the
     money an insurer makes can be profit, to make sure they're not
     price-gouging customers. ( Citation: Page 22, sec. 1101 )
             A limit is placed on what type of insurance accounts can be
     used to pay for over-the-counter drugs without a prescription.
     Basically, your insurer isn't paying for the Aspirin you bought for
     that hangover. ( Citation: Page 800, sec. 9003 )
             Employers need to list the benefits they provided to
     employees on their tax forms. ( Citation: Page 800, sec. 9002 )
             Any new health plans must provide preventative care
     (mammograms, colonoscopies, etc.) without requiring any sort of
     co-pay or charge. ( Citation: Page 14, sec. 2713 )
         1/1/2013
             If you make over $200,000 a year, your taxes go up a tiny
     bit (0.9%). Edit: To address those who take issue with the word
     "tiny", a change of 0.9% is relatively tiny. Any look at how taxes
     have fluctuated over the years will reveal that a change of less
     than one percent is miniscule, especially when we're talking about
     people in the top 5% of earners. ( Citation: Page 818, sec. 9015 )
         1/1/2014
         This is when a lot of the really big changes happen.
             No more "pre-existing conditions". At all. People will be
     charged the same regardless of their medical history. ( Citation:
     Page 45, sec. 2704, Page 46, sec. 2701, and Page 57, sec. 1255 )
             If you can afford insurance but do not get it, you will be
     charged a fee. This is the "mandate" that people are talking about.
     Basically, it's a trade-off for the "pre-existing conditions" bit,
     saying that since insurers now have to cover you regardless of what
     you have, you can't just wait to buy insurance until you get sick.
     Otherwise no one would buy insurance until they needed it. You can
     opt not to get insurance, but you'll have to pay the fee instead,
     unless of course you're not buying insurance because you just can't
     afford it. (Note: On 6/28/12, the Supreme Court ruled that this is
     Constitutional, as long as it's considered a tax on the uninsured
     and not a penalty for not buying insurance... nitpicking about
     wording, mostly, but the long and short of it is, it looks like this
     is accepted by the courts) ( Citation: Page 145, sec. 5000A, and
     here is the actual court ruling for those who wish to read it. )
         Question: What determines whether or not I can afford the
     mandate? Will I be forced to pay for insurance I can't afford?
         Answer: There are all kinds of checks in place to keep you from
     getting screwed. Kaiser actually has a webpage with a pretty good
     rundown on it, if you're worried about it. You can see it here.
         Okay, have we got that settled? Okay, moving on...
             Small businesses get some tax credits for two years. (It
     looks like this is specifically for businesses with 25 or fewer
     employees) ( Citation: Page 138, sec. 1421 )
             Businesses with over 50 employees must offer health
     insurance to full-time employees, or pay a penalty.
             Insurers now can't do annual spending caps. Their customers
     can get as much health care in a given year as they need. (
     Citation: Page 14, sec. 2711 )
             Limits how high of an annual deductible insurers can charge
     customers. ( Citation: Page 62, sec. 1302 )
             Cut some Medicare spending
             Place a $2500 limit on tax-free spending on FSAs (accounts
     for medical spending). Basically, people using these accounts now
     have to pay taxes on any money over $2500 they put into them. (
     Citation: Page 801, sec. 9005 )
             Establish health insurance exchanges and rebates for the
     lower and middle-class, basically making it so they have an easier
     time getting affordable medical coverage.
             Congress and Congressional staff will only be offered the
     same insurance offered to people in the insurance exchanges, rather
     than Federal Insurance. Basically, we won't be footing their health
     care bills any more than any other American citizen. ( Citation:
     Page 81, sec. 1312 )
             A new tax on pharmaceutical companies.
             A new tax on the purchase of medical devices.
             A new tax on insurance companies based on their market
     share. Basically, the more of the market they control, the more
     they'll get taxed.
             The amount you can deduct from your taxes for medical
     expenses increases.
         1/1/2015
             Doctors' pay will be determined by the quality of their
     care, not how many people they treat. Edit: a_real_MD addresses
     questions regarding this one in far more detail and with far more
     expertise than I can offer in this post. If you're looking for a
     more in-depth explanation of this one (as many of you are), I highly
     recommend you give his post a read.
         1/1/2017
             If any state can come up with their own plan, one which
     gives citizens the same level of care at the same price as the
     PPACA, they can ask the Secretary of Health and Human Resources for
     permission to do their plan instead of the PPACA. So if they can get
     the same results without, say, the mandate, they can be allowed to
     do so. Vermont, for example, has expressed a desire to just go
     straight to single-payer (in simple terms, everyone is covered, and
     medical expenses are paid by taxpayers). ( Citation: Page 98, sec.
     1332 )
         2018
             All health care plans must now cover preventative care (not
     just the new ones).
             A new tax on "Cadillac" health care plans (more expensive
     plans for rich people who want fancier coverage).
         2020
             The elimination of the "Medicare gap"
         Aaaaand that's it right there.
         The biggest thing opponents of the bill have against it is the
     mandate. They claim that it forces people to buy insurance, and
     forcing people to buy something is unconstitutional. Personally, I
     take the opposite view, as it's not telling people to buy a specific
     thing, just to have a specific type of thing, just like a part of
     the money we pay in taxes pays for the police and firemen who
     protect us, this would have us paying to ensure doctors can treat us
     for illness and injury.
         Plus, as previously mentioned, it's necessary if you're doing
     away with "pre-existing conditions" because otherwise no one would
     get insurance until they needed to use it, which defeats the purpose
     of insurance.
         Whew! Hope that answers the question!
         Edits: Fixing typos.
         Edit 2: Wow... people have a lot of questions. I'm afraid I
     can't get to them now (got to go to work), but I'll try to later.
         Edit 3: Okay, I'm at work, so I can't go really in-depth for
     some of the more complex questions just now, but I'll try and
     address the simpler ones. Also, a few I'm seeing repeatedly:
             For those looking for a source... well, here is the text of
     the bill, all 974 pages of it (as it sits currently after being
     amended multiple times). I can't point out page numbers just now,
     but they're there if you want them.
             The website that was to be established, I think, is
     [495]http://www.healthcare.gov/.
             A lot of people are concerned about the 1/1/2015 bit that
     says that doctors' pay will be tied to quality, not quantity.
     Because so many people want to know more about this, I've sought out
     what I believe to be the pertinent sections (From Page 307, section
     3007). It looks like this part alters a part of another bill,
     theSocial Security Act, passed a long while ago. That bill already
     regulates how doctors' pay is determined. The PPACA just changes the
     criteria. Judging by how professionals are writing about it, it
     looks like this is just referring to Medicaid and Medicare.
     Basically, this is changing how much the government pays to doctors
     and medical groups, in situations where they are already responsible
     for pay.
         Edit 4: Numerous people are pointing out I said "Medicare" when
     I meant "Medicaid". Whoops. Fixed (I think).
         Edit 5: Apparently I messed up the acronym (initialism?). Fixed.
         Edit 6: Fixed a few more places where I mixed up terms (it was
     late, I was tired). Also, for everyone asking if they can post this
     elsewhere, feel free to.
         Edit 7: Okay, I need to get to work. Thanks to everyone for the
     kind comments, and I hope I've addressed the questions most of you
     have (that I can actually answer). I just want to be sure to say,
     I'm just a guy. I'm no expert, and everything I posted here I
     attribute mostly to Wikipedia or the actual bill itself, with an
     occasional Google search to clarify stuff. I am absolutely not a
     difinitive source or expert. I was just trying to simplify things as
     best I can without dumbing them down. I'm glad that many of you
     found this helpful.
         Edit 8: Wow, this has spread all over the internet... and I'm
     kinda' embarrassed because what spread included all of my 2AM typos
     and mistakes. Well, it's too late to undo my mistakes now that the
     floodgates have opened. I only hope that people aren't too harsh on
     me for the stuff I've tried to go back and correct.
         Edit 9: Added a few citations (easy-to-find stuff). But I gotta'
     run, so the rest will have to wait.
         Edit 10: Adding a few more citations (it'll probably take me a
     while to get to all of them) and a few more additional entries as
     well.
         Edit 11: Tons more citations!
         Edit 12: I updated this with a reference to the recent court
     ruling on the mandate, and address the question everyone seems to be
     asking about it ("What if I can't afford to buy insurance?")
       [496]http://jessicadickinsongoodman.com/...
       It's complicated, it's opaque, and it's full of opportunities for
       the greedheads to profit from. With a tiny bit of "medical
       UN-Surance," not "health care," thrown in. But then that was the
       whole point, wasn't it?
       My personal gripe: In the "negotiation," at that "table" there were

       Right now, I pay $59.79 every two weeks for my health insurance
       under Kaiser Permanente in Southern California.
       California's Health Inusrance exchange is telling me that if I have
       to buy a policy in the exchange with my age (57) and gross salary
       (89,000) that my monthly premium for a single person is $635. And
       I'll have a maximum out of pocket cost of $6400.
       Right now, my maximum out of pocket cost is $1500.
       And the "silver" policy covers a lot less than my current Kaiser
       coverage.
       There is a very big difference between paying $119.58 a month
       against $635. Being forced to spend an additional $515.42 that will
       wind up in the pocket of a Wall Street CEO so he can buy another

        Recommended by:
                [647]kareylou, [648]Carol in San Antonio

       Because your insurance certainly doesn't cost $119.58 a month --
       that's just the portion that your employer passes on to you.
       For way of comparison, for me (age 50) that calculator gives a
       monthly premium of $530.  My insurance through my employer costs
       the $150/month that I pay, plus another $450 that my employer kicks
       in for a total of $600 per month.
       Yes, for many people who get insurance through work, the sticker
       shock comes because they don't realize how much the insurance
       actually costs.  Those who have priced individual policies are
       probably not particularly surprised.

 OK, here's the total breakdown for me ([652]0+ / 0-)
       Every 2 weeks for Kaiser Permanente:
       Employer pays $179.38
       I pay $59.79
       Total is $239.17
       And since the California Exchange is going to stick me with a bill
       of $635 every month that's still a jump of $395.83 for me.
       And add in the high copays with a Silver plan.
       And the next factor to consider is that the ACA allows the
       racketeers to charge up to 3 times the base amount because of my
       age and preexisting condition. So that $635 for a healthy 57 year
       old could conceivably go to $1,905 a month for me.
       And every penny of that extortion will go the pimps running the

 Your math is off... ([656]0+ / 0-)
       ...because you're comparing a premium for two weeks ($239.17) with
       one that is for every month ($635).  If you factor for the
       different time periods, the difference shrinks to $115/month ($520
       vs $635).
       And the reason that difference exists is because your employer
       charges the same amount to every employee, regardless of age -- in
       other words, the cost is the same for a 25 year old coworker as it
       is for you.  So the premium through the exchange would be lower for
       everyone who is under age 45, the same for someone who is between
       45 and 55, and slightly higher for someone who is between 55 and
       65.
       You're also misunderstanding the provision for charging 3x -- that
       based on age, not preexisting conditions, and is already factored
       into that $635 (which is 3x what someone in his/her early twenties
       would pay).  The only way that they could charge you more than that
       $635 is if you're a smoker.
       You may want to try understanding what you're criticizing before
       you go ballistic.

       very big apple.
       One of the easiest RW lies to debunk is that ACA is "socialized
       medicine".  The term is uniquely American invented by the AMA to
       undermine President Truman's efforts to improve health care
       coverage...nothing changes.
       No country in the world which enjoys universal coverage calls it
       "socialized medicine".
       When told that the federal government will NOT be administering the
       exchanges but that it will be done by private, for profit
       companies, RWingers usually stop and take at least a moment to
       re-group.  It doesn't mean that they understand or accept the

 at the time the ACA was being debated... ([760]0+ / 0-)

   even before it was enacted, it was apparent to me that, once enacted,
   the President and his allies needed a permanent, ongoing, sustainted
   public relations educational campaign to ensure all of its benefits
   were accurately conveyed to the American people and to rebut the likely
   disinformation. After waiting for a couple of years and seeing the
   results of the 2010 election which hinged, in large part, on the
   success of that disinformation campaign against the Affordable Care
   Act, it occurred to me that the President and his staff apparently had
   no intention of defending it until the 2012 campaign. And during the
   2012 campaign they did defend it...sort of.

   There is still a need for a permanent, ongoing, sustained
   educational/public relations campaign to accurately convey what the
   Affordable Care Act is...and what it isn't. It would be great if the
   Democrats could finally get around to...starting one.

   The Democratic Party's handling of the the ACA after it's passage is
   emblemmatic of the Democratic Party as a whole...all too willing
   to...at least sometimes...do the right thing...and then hope for the
   best. They have no backbone...even when they win and even when they're
   right. No wonder the Republicans are always trying to yank their
   chain...over virtually everything...it's because Republican'ts know
   that Democrats will always allow them to get away with the crap they
   do. And Democrats never fail to live up to Republicans' expectations to
   help to do the Republicans' own dirty work.

   Even when Democrats win...they still cower.

   Explaining to doubter acquaintances in person, and to friends of FB
   friends online, about how the ACA has already saved me a bundle. Here's
   what I tell them:

   I am self-employed ( and under-employed), so I have HDLP insurance.
   This is, for now, the only way I can swing health insurance.

   Since the ACA went into effect, my premiums stopped increasing as
   dramatically from year to year as they had in the past. This is great.

   But a more concrete example of how the ACA saves me money occurred in
   the last few months, when I had my very first screening colonoscopy.

   Thanks to the ACA, I did not have to pay a sizable co-pay or deductible
   that I would otherwise would have had to pay.

   I also successfully challenged the physician's effort to charge me a
   sizable co-pay for his having removed a polyp during the procedure*.

   All together I saved over a thousand dollars.

   I have a basic knowledge of what the thing is and what it's supposed to
   do. But I have no idea what I'm supposed to do to get in on it. And
   believe me I've been trying to find out for two years. I'm not even
   sure when this is going to kick in.

   A large part of that is because of the tediously ongoing efforts by the
   reptiles to repeal it and/or at least screw it up so badly that it's
   worthless. Another part is an almost complete lack of useful
   information that isn't in vague, convoluted gov-speak.

   Much to my surprise I'm officially a senior with "special
   circumstances" that were beyond my control. I'm on food stamps,
   although no cash assistance. My small savings has been depleted over
   the last two years. In a few weeks I'll start getting a itty bitty
   Social Security check. Hell I'm not even going to sign up for Part B
   Medicare in three years because it costs too much.

   So I'm supposed to buy health insurance from a corporation? I hear no.
   I hear that there will be "options" available for low income people
   like me.

   SWELL! Talk to me about them! And they'd better be awesome because $500
   a month only goes so far and I have needs too.

       if your income is below 133% of the poverty level in your state.
       This assumes that your state will be accepting Medicaid expansion.
       Much of what's going to happen in 2014 is unclear because it
       depends on each state's participation in expanded Medicaid and an
       exchange. The feds are still ironing out the details. Some states
       have not done the work that needs to be done. Some states are
       deliberately dragging their feet, and some are flat out refusing to
       participate (so far).

   I've spent hours researching, and gotten nowhere, so I've given up
   until October. The bottom line is that until the exchanges are up and
   running, there is no information on what will be available at what
   cost. The regs on the bronze, silver, whatever plans haven't been
   completed yet, and the pricing will depend on whatever the insurance
   companies think they can extract, and there will be hundreds of options
   to choose from (like Medicare Part D only worse).

   It is a nightmare even for highly educated and incurably curious
   people. It is impossible for anyone else.

   which I thought was one of its biggest flaws: not giving some benefit
   to the majority (for example, a public option available to everyone.)

   Since most people still get insurance through their employer, ACA
   doesn't affect them directly.

   Yes, there's a large minority that it does help (under-26, pre-existing
   conditions, uninsured, donut-hole, etc.), but it's reasonable for a
   majority to wonder how it helps them, because it doesn't directly.

       Seems to me highly likely that coverage through employers is likely

       Administration wants, but I think they've badly misjudged what will
       actually happen on the ground.
       It actually would probably make more sense financially for
       employers to bump up salaries a bit and let employees shop on their
       own for coverage.
       And the manipulation of terms of employment to take people out of
       the "mandatory coverage" category will be a whole new growth
       industry.

   I still see articles claiming "Price Shock Coming!!" as young people

   when we all know premiums never, ever rose before health care reform .
   . . and what's more, if the insurance companies tried to jack up young
   folks' premiums in order to keep old folks' premiums high (they are
   limited to a 3x age rating under the ACA), they would run into the
   "medical loss ratio" and have to issue refunds.

   I agree that the administration and the Democrats probably haven't done
   enough to sell the ACA, but I also recognize that it is a very tough
   task to do so.  Most people are appallingly ignorant about health
   insurance in general, to say nothing about a major change like this.

   I talk to people all the time, educated professional types, who know
   little or nothing about what is or isn't in their health insurance.
   They don't know about deductibles or co-pays or out-of-pocket limits or
   lifetime maximums or any of that stuff.

   It's hard to sell the improvements of Obamacare when people don't know
   where they are now.  For example, under Obamacare there will no more
   yearly or lifetime maximums.  This is great news for everybody, but I
   bet many people don't even know that their current coverage is subject
   to a maximum.    Under Obamacare, out-of-pocket limits will be fixed at
   reasonable levels, but its hard to explain this when people don't even
   know what and out-of-pocket limit is.

   I guess the basic problem is that people don't like to think about the
   implications of getting sick or injured, so they don't.

   I also think the advantages will become much clearer once the law is
   implemented.  It's easy to demagogue an unknown.   Once a benefit
   exists, it will become and entitlement and a political sacred cow.
   That is why the right is so terrified of universal health care, since
   they know that in the long run it will be a huge political winner for
   Democrats.

   yet they refuse to tell people that their kids can stay on their

   The Obama administration has always been up against it from not only
   Republicans but the reticence of the media to inform the public of the
   plan's benefits.

   The good news is the ACA will not be repealed and, despite ignorance
   and propaganda, the public will come to learn more and more about it in

   Hell, my wife and I have been arguing about this for over a year, and
   we're both pretty liberal Dems: my employer-provided coverage told us a
   year and a half ago that they weren't offering our "Cadillac" plan to
   anyone anymore, and we now have $30 copays for ordinary doctor visits,
   $50 for specialists. We used to have no copays at all for office
   visits. She blames Obama and says it can't be a coincidence, the timing
   of all this. I say they're using it as an excuse to cut their own
   costs, and that it has nothing to do with the affordable care act.
   Bottom line, though, is that this happened to us in a year where one of
   our kids needed surgery and then physical therapy for a broken leg, and
   at $50 an ortho followup visit and $30 a PT visit, we paid WAY more out
   of pocket for health care in 2012 than we ever did before.

   And we're relatively smart, well-educated people who pay attention to
   the news and generally trust that Obama is trying to do the right thing
   -- take our exact situation and apply it to the millions of people who
   don't already have that outlook.

 There is an ongoing theme ([1097]0+ / 0-)

   that is captured here and in today's NYT piece on Obama losing ground
   on economic leadership.  The 'splainers in this admin. have been shitty
   from the get-go, preferring obliqueness to directness, and assuming
   their adversaries were not complete obstructionists.

   Obama has repeated lain down with the dogs, and the fleas now plague
   him.  If its in his nature to be a forceful leader on these issues, its
   time he sets it free.  After all, he's done with elected office, and
   legacy as it currently stands, will be rather milquetoasty if the
   status quo remains unchanged.

   The congress and r/w noise machine require that the Admin step up
   communications, and take no prisoners when dealing with the bullshit
   'budget' and 'debt' issues.  If they will make it clear they're playing
   in a different game than the Republicans and Wall St., then the
   'people' may discover that the 'understand' things better.  As it
   stands now, without forceful leadership, the next two years will be a
   positioning battle, with little or nothing getting done, and that only
   helps the R's, since O will be blamed one way or the other.

   estimated even a year ago. [[1103]http://cbo.gov/...]
   I'm learning that there is great skepticism that these exchanges will
   exist when they are supposed to. I'm finding out that the Obama
   administration is now cautioning not to expect private healthcare
   premiums to go down, but more likely to continue to rise.

     "After extensive research, the administration said it was unwise to
     tell consumers that they could get "health insurance that fits your
     budget." That message, it said, is "seen as highly motivational, but
     not as believable."

   [1104]http://www.nytimes.com/...
   I'm discovering that there will be various yet-unpublicized fees and
   taxes that will contribute to making my insurance more expensive. I'm
   hearing that my mother's Medicare Advantage will be notably more
   pricey. I'm reading that businesses are putting plans to hire on hold,
   or are planning to reduce staff, in the face of both uncertainty and
   projected added costs.
    In fact, if there is much good news in this setup for me and my wife,
   I'm having a really hard time finding out what that is, beyond possibly
   a free pap smear and a "free" colonoscopy (actual cost dependent on

   It has some nice provisions, but the truth is that it delayed a
   solution to the problem, probably by decades. We still have for-profit
   health insurance. That's always going to be too costly, and it sucks
   money out of the parts of the economy where we need it. It's therefore
   delayed the recovery.

   By changing things to force more people into the for-profit system we
   just delayed fixing the problem and added to costs. The only feasible
   solution, in an economic sense, is a universal publicly-funded system.
   Instead, what we got was Democrats and Republicans combining to give us
   an expansion of the system that doesn't work.

   How is this system going to get the healthcare segment of the economy
   back down under 15% of GDP? It ain't.

   If you've seen the news about "Obamacare will kill Americans" in

   don't know how it will benefit them, Republicans are working hard to
   discredit it before the provisions kick in. They want people to hear
   the lies - because in the absence of any pushback from Democrats, the
   lies will become the 'truth' everyone knows.

   This is how they have everyone thinking Social Security will have to be
   cut, Medicare will have to be dismantled. Repeat a lie often enough,
   loudly enough, drown out any opposing voices - and people will accept
   it as the truth.

   Democrats have to get over the idea that calling out lying liars is
   somehow impolite and counter productive. We need more Alan Graysons.

   Recommended by:
          [1131]Bailey2001, [1132]kareylou, [1133]Carol in San Antonio

   and I read a lot about it and am generally good at crunching numbers,
   fine print, and all that.
   Why? There's just way too much uncertainty about what will actually
   happen.

   1. There's a lot of spam coming through and appearing as ads on
   websites that claims to be doing things because of the ACA, but it's
   malarky -- hard to sort out.
   2. There are a lot of anti-ACA people deliberately putting out false
   propaganda ("premiums skyrocketing due to ACA," "death panels,"
   "emergency rooms will be forced to close," "no doctor will take
   Medicare or Medicaid" etc. etc.) that intentionally muddies the waters.
   3. Until I see actual insurance available and subsidies spelled out, I
   keep being told there will be some better options and I'll be able to
   afford them -- but I frankly don't believe it. I am especially
   skeptical about "affordability" for the 50-64-year-olds (that would be
   me), since the law allows them to charge me 3x what they charge my
   children. So if they're paying $250, I'm going to pay $750. That is NOT
   "affordable."
        Another example: The definition of "full-time" employee is based
   on hours worked. As an adjunct college professor, if they just look at
   classroom hours, no one will count as full-time (not even the salaried
   full professors) -- we just don't spend 40 hours a week in class, or
   even 31. (If you teach 3 3-credit courses, you are in the classroom 9
   hours a week.) But I've been told they are NOT going to include the
   hours preparing, meeting with students, department meetings, and
   grading papers. So the employer mandate is going to be an absolute
   nightmare and lawyers' full employment act, and my prediction is that
   fewer people will end up covered through their jobs than are at
   present.
   4. The insurance companies are going to do their best to provide a lot
   less coverage, with higher deductibles and co-pays, for much higher
   premiums; I anticipate that the issues around actually getting your
   bills covered will get exponentially worse.
   5. Congress is doing its best to repeal the law, or at least defund it,
   so everything could change between now and 2014.

   In short, I'll believe it when I see it. Until then, if anyone asks me
   whether I understand what it will do, I will say "not really."

   it's deeply flawed, pro-corporate, pro-profit legislation that does
   little to address the fundamental problems of health care in this
   country.

   It's Rahm Emmanuel/DLC-inspired legislation.

   It's not reform of any sort.  It  protects and reinforces the very
   systems that continue to rip people off.  It tinkers around the edges
   while running away from doing any sort of the heavy lifting of legit
   reform.

   It's indicative of President Obama's first term: Huge "grand bargains"
   masquerading as reform.  But in reality it's simply ongoing management
   of the existing, corrupt, power structures.  Not challenging, much less
   actually changing even slightly, those corrupt structures.

   And if he doesn't evidence different choices in his second term,
   protecting the powerful and wealthy from any sort of legit "Change."
   will be his true legacy.

 I bet most of that is because ([1147]0+ / 0-)

   For a large group of people nothing has changed.

   They are still doing without health care, with no idea if it will ever
   happen for them. It's been so long with no change for them, no expanded
   Medicaid, or anything.

   In fact, the costs have been going up for them, and they have been
   having to do without, when they can't find decent jobs to pay for
   health care.

   It's taken too long to kick in, and there is so much uncertainty
   because the Republicans in the states are fooling around, trying to
   appear as though they will be able to block it, and generally making
   everyone think it isn't going to help them. Look at what is happening
   in Arkansas and Florida, for instance.

   The working poor are seeing that, and figuring that, as with just about
   everything, they aren't gettin' any.

 about those tax credits to small businesses ([1150]0+ / 0-)

   little known fact is that the sequester has removed them, at least for
   now. Even the form that covered it was pulled back (after originally
   being released).

   [1151]http://www.irs.gov/...

   The sequester works in mysterious ways, and the Republicans are
   counting on that, I guess.

   It is unfortunate that the ACA is such a hard thing to grasp, but
   perhaps unavoidable due to the tack it took - basically throwing the
   kitchen sink, minus a single-payer (or even a public option, for that
   matter), at the problem. Hopefully the conversation will continue on to
   ACA 2.0, (Improved) Medicare For All!
