   Rescuers search through rubble after a tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma,
   May 20, 2013. A 2-mile-wide (3-km-wide) tornado tore through the
   Oklahoma City suburb of Moore on Monday, killing at least 51 people
   while destroying entire tracts of homes, piling cars atop one another,
   and trapping two dozen school children beneath rubble. REUTERS/Gene
   Blevins (UNITED STATES - Tags: ENVIRONMENT DISASTER) - RTXZUNL
   The [29]search for survivors of Monday's massive tornado continues in
   Oklahoma, with crews searching destroyed buildings and vehicles:

     The official death toll stood at 51 Tuesday morning, but it was sure
     to rise. A coroner's office official said some 40 bodies have yet to
     be processed by medical examiners--roughly half of them children.
     More bodies could be hidden under the vast debris field, authorities
     warned.

     Hundreds of people were injured.

   While most major news sources continue to report 51 dead, there are
   [30]conflicting reports, however. According to Reuters:

     Officials in Oklahoma City said on Tuesday that 24 bodies were
     recovered after a devastating tornado tore through Moore, Okla., a
     sharp decline from the 51 deaths they previously reported.

     "We have got good news. The number right now is 24," said Amy
     Elliott, chief administrative officer at the Oklahoma City Medical
     Examiner's Office. The prior figure of 51 dead may have included
     some double-reported casualties, Elliott said.

   Here's hoping.

   President Obama has declared a major disaster; he will speak about
   Oklahoma at 10 am Eastern.

   [31]6:35 AM PT: The AP follows Reuters:
   [32][APLogo_normal.jpg] BREAKING: Medical examiner's office revises
   death toll from Oklahoma tornado to at least 24.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       that are never found. Plus, there are all those people that went
       into shelters are were buried alive. They won't know the true death
       toll until they've had time to account for every person who lives
       in that area, which could take a while. I think the focus on trying
       to glean which number that is floating around is correct is at this
       point premature.

       They won't be able to come up with an accurate number for days,
       maybe weeks.
       Many towns in this area have people register their shelters so that
       the powers that be can locate those shelters in case of a storm of
       this magnitude. That alone speaks to the difficulty of search and
       rescue in these situations.
       Plus, as you accurately note, some people are carried away never to
       be seen again ... not just a compelling movie scenario, iow.

   They seem to be implying that the death toll is 91. So horrible. I went
   to college with a wonderful person from Midwest City OK and she told us
    about their storm cellar in the back yard. I still don't get why these
   schools  didn't at least have a "safe room."

       I didn't think such a thing existed at all WRT tornadoes, but was
       directed by a kossack to a company that builds them.
       The ones I saw were very small and expensive -- literally
       closet-sized safes bolted to the floor.  I can't imagine the cost
       of doing something like that for an entire school.
       On the other hand, schools are among the safest places to be in a
       tornado.  They are built much more solidly than surrounding homes,
       and tend to have a central hallway away from windows.
       In this case, a very powerful tornado scored a direct hit.  Very
       tough to protect against that.

       In tornado alley, you have to have a shelter for schools.  Areas in
       Missouri and Arkansas have them.

       anytime anyone mentions the "cost" when it comes to safety
       precautions that will save lives it bothers me....especially
       considering the outrageous costs of things we do not need and that
       do not save lives such as corporate welfare, tax breaks for the
       rich, pay raises for already overpaid Senators and Reps and so
       forth that happen continually.  The amount of money we "spend" as a
       country on offensively unnecessary things that bolster the
       fortunate is shameful, particularly when there's non-stop
       politically motivated cost-cutting that hurts people who actually
       do need help.
       We have more than enough money to do things in this country that
       need to be done, that should have been done decades ago...our
       priorities have been skewed and screwed for the last 30-some years
       (during the hard right turn in our politics, of course).
       Our nation's priorities should be infrastructure, public safety,
       health care, education, better economic equality, worker's rights
       and protections, jobs, medical research and scientific
       advancements...but we know what they have been instead. And it's
       disgusting.
       To be blunt, if you do not suffer from seriously diminished mental
       capacity or the personality disorder that is right wing extremism
       and still vote Republican...I'd double check on the two previously
       mentioned conditions.

 That's an easy "Nope", but what does it mean? ([201]0+ / 0-)
       Are those shelters built underground?
       That would seem like the best place to build one, but...
       We're talking Oklahoma and red clay dirt.
       That's a special problem when building basements. And a very
       expensive one.
       It's easy to sit back and cluck because somebody else has made a
       choice you don't like, but -- money doesn't grow on trees, and the
       decissions in Oklahoma may have been very rational.
       Question 1:
       How many children have been killed by tornadoes in schools in
       Oklahoma over the years?
       What would you have them give up to reduce that number by how much?
       Science education?
       Music?
       Math?

       the schools didn't have them, although there's conflicting info

       died.)
       those links indie posted are good. I hadn't seen them, and didn't
       know a large underground structure could be constructed in this
       fashion (although, if they can build bunkers at nuclear missile
       silos bigger than most homes, I guess they can do this too. But
       those bunkers were super expensive, still are, now that most are
       decommissioned and are up for sale to the private sector.)

   I am not clear which ME Office is reporting these figures, but I know

   confidence in their abilities to even count bodies correctly.

   Still, it's an awful mess, a desperate situation for many people.
   Normally, I would stay away from the politics in a situation like this
   by Coburn opened that can o' worms in less than 4 hours.
   Good to see that Obama spoke with Mary Fallin and Tom Cole (who
   represents OKC and lives in Moore) and that they are taking a realistic
   approach. To his credit, Cole voted FOR Sandy relief, so it's less
   annoying to support him in this.
   Coburn, OTOH.....

   If I ran this circus, things would be DIFFERENT!

 CNN is the one that reported 91 dead. ([314]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [315]FiredUpInCA

   Last night, around midnight central time, KFOR announced that CNN was
   reporting that 91 were dead, and that the source was the medical
   examiner's office.

   So, CNN false reporting, yet again.

   The 51 number had been reported for hours, started around 8pm central.

   What they have reported this morning is that were indeed duplicates
   reported, and the medical examiner's office is getting ready to provide
   a clear update.

   Some people may think it's too early, but I don't think it is, to talk
   about storm shelters.  I watched this live from the beginning of the
   tornado on KFOR.  As soon as the tornado roped-out, the chopper went
   back and started looking at damage.  Horrific.  As they showed the
   school, just minutes after the hit, I was thinking, "Surely those
   children are underground in a shelter."

   But no, there was no shelter.

   In some places, like Missouri, my research has shown that local bonds
   pay for shelters for schools.

   After this area was hit on May 3rd 1999, many that rebuilt here built
   shelters.  It was recommended.  Yesterday, the meteorologists were
   telling everyone live on air to evacuate and get underground.  They
   cited their experience in 1999 -- you must get underground.

   How in the world anyone could live in tornado alley, and have
   experienced the storms they have, especially in 1999, and not built
   shelters at schools -- I don't understand it.  I just don't understand
   it.

   As I posted above:

   Many towns in this area have people register their shelters so that the
   powers that be can locate those shelters in case of a storm of this
   magnitude. That alone speaks to the difficulty of search and rescue in
   these situations.

   Plus, some people are carried away never to be seen again ... it's not
   just a compelling movie scenario, iow.

   REGIONAL FOOD BANK OF OKLAHOMA

   The Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma, in partnership with Oklahoma
   Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, is asking that the public
   support all rescue, recovery and disaster relief efforts with donations
   of cash to your favorite responding charity.

   Donations of items such as clothing and supplies are strongly
   discouraged.

   Financial donations will allow disaster relief agencies to purchase
   whatever items are deemed necessary without resulting in the additional
   burden of securing warehouse space and volunteers to work donated
   product.

   To make a tax deductible donation to the Regional Food Bank of
   Oklahoma, go to www.regionalfoodbank.org or call 604-7111 or text FOOD
   to 32333 to give $10 to relief efforts.

   The elevation of appearance over substance, of celebrity over
   character, of short term gains over lasting achievement displays a
   poverty of ambition. It distracts you from what's truly important. -

   At a time of extreme tragedy and unimaginable sadness for the victims
   of such a disaster, the last thing they need is for heartless and
   grandstanding politicians in Washington to rush press releases touting
   their "fiscal responsibility" in denying even basic aid from the
   federal government. Oklahoma deserves our prayers and our tireless
   assistance, not lectures from Tea Party hacks juggling their artificial
   outrage over some IRS questionnaires that have their most unhinged
   supporters in a tizzy. Republicans need to stop blocking disaster aid,
   and to publicly promise to do so while bodies are still being recovered
   is despicable...  -  [340]progresspolitics
