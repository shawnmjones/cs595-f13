   Date: 01 January 2011

   The United Nations made history today as UN Women, the UN organization
   dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women, has
   officially begun its work. This ambitious new organization consolidates
   and scales up UN actions to achieve gender equality, offering the
   promise of accelerated progress in realizing the rights of women
   worldwide.

   Formally known as the [74]UN Entity for Gender Equality and the
   Empowerment of Women, UN Women emerged from agreement by UN Member
   States -- backed by strong advocacy from the global women's movement --
   that more must be done so women can claim equal rights and
   opportunities.

   "UN Women will significantly boost UN efforts to promote gender
   equality, expand opportunity and tackle discrimination around the
   globe, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.

   "This is a time of great promise, said UN Women Executive Director
   Michelle Bachelet, formerly President of Chile. "We have a historic
   opportunity to accelerate the achievement of what champions of gender
   equality have worked towards for years.

   UN Women was created by a UN General Assembly resolution in July 2010,
   becoming fully operational on 1 January 2011. It merges and builds on
   four parts of the UN system:
     * Division for the Advancement of Women
     * International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement
       of Women
     * Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of
       Women
     * United Nations Development Fund for Women

   As a global champion for women, UN Women will work with UN Member
   States to agree on international standards for gender equality, and
   help countries implement those standards. It will assist other UN
   agencies engaged with a broad spectrum of development issues to
   integrate gender equality priorities in their activities. Carrying out
   its programmes, UN Women will also work closely with civil society
   partners.

   Gender equality is a basic human right and has enormous socio-economic
   ramifications. Empowering women fuels thriving economies, for example,
   spurring productivity and growth.

   Many countries have made significant progress in advancing women's
   standing, but gender discrimination remains deeply entrenched in every
   society. Women continue to suffer extreme forms of violence, and are
   locked out of many economic opportunities. Only low numbers participate
   in politics.

   The United Nations has consistently supported progress in addressing
   these shortfalls but has faced hindrances including inadequate funding.
   A minimum of US$500 million has been set as the annual operating budget
   for UN Women.
