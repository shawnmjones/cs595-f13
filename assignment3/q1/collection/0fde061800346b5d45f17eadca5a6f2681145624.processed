   Depression-era black and white photo of big crowd waiting in a soup
   line.
   Just look at all those Depression-era people not starving.
   Last week, [29]John Stossel gave a master class in how Fox News keeps
   its viewers misled and misinformed on economic issues, concluding with
   the bombshell "fact" that "think about the Depression. That was before
   there was any welfare state at all. How many people starved? No one."

   Whoa, really? [30]No, actually.

     President Herbert Hoover declared, "Nobody is actually starving. The
     hoboes are better fed than they have ever been." But in New York
     City in 1931, there were 20 known cases of starvation; in 1934,
     there were 110 deaths caused by hunger. There were so many accounts
     of people starving in New York that the West African nation of
     Cameroon sent $3.77 in relief.

   Also, breadlines. Also, an [31]increase in the suicide rate. But before
   Stossel even got to that claim, he'd unleashed quite the load of
   right-wing economic messaging disguised as homespun folksy common
   sense.

   The starting problem was the national debt, of course. Stossel opened
   with a man-on-the-street segment asking "what would you cut?" The
   people (all women, coincidentally or not) he showed attempting to
   answer were stumped. But of course the question needed to be
   challenged. What would I cut? I'd cut [32]tax expenditures that favor
   the wealthy, but most people don't yet understand that exclusions from
   taxable income, itemized deductions, preferential tax rates on capital
   gains and dividends, and tax credits could be counted as government
   expenditures that could be cut as opposed to the dread "raising taxes."
   But even that aside, I'd also just plain raise revenue. That's not an
   option that exists in Stosselville. No, Stossel would start by cutting
   "whole departments. Why do we have a Commerce Department? Commerce.
   Just Happens. Agriculture, farmers do that, you don't need
   bureaucrats." One of the women on the street said don't cut education?
   Pshaw! "Almost all [education] has been done at the local level. Now
   they spend at the federal level almost $100 billion a year, scores
   haven't improved."

   Let's look at that. The Commerce Department includes the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. You like knowing there's a
   hurricane coming? That's the Commerce Department, not that John Stossel
   wants you to know that. Agriculture? Well, if you like to know that the
   meat you eat has been inspected, that's the USDA. Also, too, food
   stamps and nutritional assistance for low-income mothers and their
   children. Not that Stossel probably approves of poor children being
   fed. And education? That number includes things like [33]Head Start,
   school breakfast and lunch for low-income kids, Pell Grants, and more.
   Do you want to join Stossel in waving that all off as stuff that the
   federal government doesn't need to be doing because education can
   happen at the local level? Well, your answer doesn't really matter,
   because if you're getting your information from Stossel, you don't even
   know about all that.

   Wait, though! Before Stossel even got to those cuts, he unleashed a
   version of the [34]federal budget as family budget that we've all seen
   our conservative family and friends smugly post on Facebook. And oh,
   wow, the U.S. has debt and no family in the history of ever had any
   debt without it being because they were irresponsible deadbeats. There
   is absolutely no such thing as investing in your family's future
   through a mortgage or educational loan or small business loan, is
   there? Not according to John Stossel, there isn't.

   Then there are the government benefits. Astonishingly, John Stossel
   found out he is eligible for 55 government benefits for things like
   being a stutterer. Even though he has a job and health insurance and is
   "doing well in life." Except, sort of in a parenthetical aside he
   admits that "I don't know that I would get all of them ... but
   according to this website I could try and I'm in the game, I bet I
   could get some." Because people, those soft-hearted, soft-headed
   people, think the government should be helping people. And that brings
   us back around to the end, with the zero people who starved in the
   Depression, back when the government didn't help anyone and it made us
   all stronger or something. Except the people who actually did starve,
   or committed suicide, or survived only by standing on breadlines
   getting help from someone, even if it wasn't the federal government in
   the early days of the Depression, before Herbert Hoover and his view
   that the hoboes were really well fed were resoundingly kicked out of
   office.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       How are dying stars a metaphor the extremification of the GOP?
       -         they spend their lives feeding on and spewing hot gases;
       -         their structure and existence always represents a
       contradiction in that it consists of a balance between great
       opposing qualities or forces: one force's proclivity is to contract
       and pull in on itself and hoard energy and mass; the other force
       wants to expand outward and belch its gaseous contents all over
       creation, trespassing on others' realms;
       -         to maintain a steady output of energy, they must consume
       themselves from within;
       -         as they age they become unstable, violently blowing off
       their various lighter constituencies, setting up a series of
       catastrophic and future (and futile) self-defeating events for
       themselves;
       -         the great opposing forces can be sustained for a long
       time when held in balance, but they cannot tolerate this
       contradiction forever, especially if one of the forces becomes
       stronger than the other;
       -         at a critical point for the aging body the contracting
       force prevails over the expansive force and in one great shift
       enormous amounts of the mass collapses in towards the center,
       whilst
       -         another larger constituency is ejected away from the star
       forever, and will eventually create clumps of  mass elsewhere; the
       less-dense materials are flung out and form new coalitions of and
       by gravitational influence;
       -         only the core of the original body is left, consisting
       solely of its most dense constituents; in fact, the collapse itself
       produces new matter even more dense than had ever existed before;
       -         the final collapsed center of the dying star may reach
       temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees while at the same
       time gravitationally sucking down even much of its own light -
       which is a way of saying that it produces far more heat than light;
       -         cores of the greatest densities become black holes,
       exiting the visible universe and soon governing ing themselves
       under completely different and idiosyncratic laws of physics and
       gravitational phenomena; the extreme density of black holes warp
       both time and space, bending and distorting all light quanta that
       may stray near them; an accretion disk surrounds the dense core,
       pulling resources from smaller bodies in its sphere of influence,
       inexorably fattening as it gorges on lighter-weight bodies; their
       now infinitely dense qualities are unseen, though those bodies with
       the greatest resources still furtively affect important matter(s)
       from a distance.
       -         black holes and other ultra-dense bodies suck gas and
       other matter from lighter formerly-stable conservative bodies,
       gorging on them insatiably and inexorably and greedily feasting on
       their energy and matter for no other purpose than to expand
       endlessly, mindlessly...

 Even if private charity was adequate, ([139]3+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [140]417els, [141]a2nite, [142]JerryNA

       Stossel thinks that the  mere adequacy of private efforts were
       enough to condemn FDR for insturive intervention in the Great
       Depression.
       In 1929, the Gross National Product was $101.6 billion (Not
       adjusted for inflation). In 1933, the GNP had fallen to $53
       billion. That's a shortfall of $48 B. Using a multiplier of 3.5 (a
       standard economic assumption), Roosevelt would have needed new
       spending on the order of $13.9 annually to bring the economy back
       to what it was. Until World War II drove spending to new heights,
       FDR never spent more than $8.8 total for any year.
       Now, picture two scenarios. In the one, Roosevelt had done even
       less. In the other, FDR had spent that 13.9 on home front
       preparedness projects--the St. Lawrence Seaway, railroad
       rebuilding, highway and bridge construction, etc. Wouldn't most
       people prefer the second scenario?
       The furor over Friday's [10.5] job report revealed a political
       movement that is rooting for American failure, so obsessed with
       taking down Obama that good news drives its members into a blind
       rage. -Paul Krugman

       The ability of present day economic elitists to rise so far above
       humanity that they feel entitled to the resources of the country
       for themselves is stunningly portrayed by another 'I'll take my
       ball and go home' tycoon.
       Let's all pray that this country starts suspecting the motives of
       these point of view analysts that portray themselves as moderates;
       they've been running to the right for some time.

       I don't think there's a "Yonge Street" anywhere else. I've noticed
       this image being used in several DK diaries on this subject, and
       have been mildly amused.
       Not that the Great Depression was any better north of the border.
       And neither was the social safety net, at that time. It has
       improved since then, but there's still a lot of work to do.

       that anything not visible to frontier era illiterate herdsmen
       either doesn't exist or else is not qualified to be considered by
       government.
       Their so-called philosophy of agreeing to prevent nose-hitting from
       fist-swinging is a lie because in any given situation, at any given
       time in history, there have always been methods to demonstrate
       nose-injuring that the libertarians have always insisted on
       preventing being used.

     the state, but then they came into power and spent more. Consider
     George W. Bush's eight horrendous years: The budget grew 89
     percent--from $1.86 trillion to $3.52 trillion.

       This is from his "Correction" to his statement that no one died of
       starvation during the Depression.

     30 percent of American men belonged to mutual aid societies, groups
     of people with similar backgrounds who banded together to help
     members in trouble. They paid for doctors, built orphanages, cooked
     for the poor. Neighbors knew best what neighbors needed. They helped
     the helpless, but taught self-sufficiency to others.
       That is some straight up [272]commie pinko talk right there.

       "the most watched" network without all the attention they get for

       Fox plays to people's fears and prejudices and reinforces it by

       their fear mongering. I say, let them live alone in their crazy
       bubble.
       Plus, even as "the most watched" they only have an audience of
       about[375]two million and falling....that's less than one percent
       of Americans. NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams averages about
       [376]23.4 million viewers.

   use their megaphone in the media to try to get their followers to
   believe--that all people who receive "government benefits" are brown or
   foreign.  "Those people" are lazy, greedy, undeserving by definition.
   When ordinary (white) people meet with rough patches in their lives and
   need a hand, that's somehow different.  This fundamental lie makes it
   easy to demand that "government benefits" be slashed, which they then
   tout as good character training for those deadbeats.

   As for those departments which don't seem to do anything that these
   morons can perceive, they are all for giving them the chop.  That is
   until a function of one of those departments  affects them personally.
    Then, of course, they make an exception.

   What would I cut first?  Subsidies to large corporations.  Tax
   loopholes for those same companies and the megarich.  A huge chunk of
   "homeland security", including the outfitting of local police with high
   tech and/or deadly combat gear.  That would be a start.

       about this the other day:
       [517]Surprise! CBO report shows 50% of government tax expenditures
       go to top 20% of earners

     They're called tax "expenditures" to distinguish them from actual
     federal spending, say, to buy tanks or stationery. But they do have
     an impact on revenue that would otherwise be received, and they thus
     do contribute to the federal deficit when the budget is not in
     balance. By giving selected groups favorable treatment under the tax
     code, they affect individuals' and corporate economic behavior and
     have an impact on the distribution of income.

     The CBO reviewed the top 10 tax expenditures in four major
     categories. First, exclusions from taxable
     income--employer-sponsored health insurance, net pension
     contributions and earnings, capital gains on assets transferred at
     death, and a portion of Social Security and Railroad Retirement
     benefits. Second, itemized deductions--certain taxes paid to state
     and local governments, mortgage interest payments and charitable
     contributions. Third, preferential tax rates on capital gains and
     dividends; and, finally, tax credits--the earned income tax credit,
     and the child tax credit.
     All told, these tax expenditures amount to $900 billion, about 5.7
     percent of total U.S. economic output. As Derek Thompson points out,
     that's more than is spent on Medicare or Defense or Social Security.
     Whether any one of these expenditures is good or bad depends on
     ideology and personal preference as much as anything. They represent
     a wide array of interests that allows the federal government to
     promote everything from cheaper home ownership to oil drilling.

   His family share-cropped cotton west Texas. He told me stories of
   entire families walking down the highways looking for work, and
   starving women coming to their house begging for milk for their babies.
   It made a strong enough impression on him to make him vote a pro-union

   Through this one aspect of this one topic -- Fox daily messaging for
   eliminating the Federal government to turn the States into sovereign
   entities -- you deftly produced a thousand points of neurological
   insight.

   You also make the case that the Civil War never ended and is still
   raging. When the South flies the Confederate flag, they are at least
   being honest.

   We do not acknowledge this. The virus continues to spread and take root

   "For the banks of America, Hoover has prescribed oxygen. For the
   unemployed, chlorine."

   "We march on starvation, we march against death,
   we're ragged, we've nothing but body and breath;
   From north and from south, from east and from west
   the army of hunger is marching."

   It's not like there were census takers going across the dust bowl
   counting all the dead who suffered from malnutrition or its effects and
   had premature death as a result. Generations with stunted growth and
   poor brain development. Meanwhile, crops were being dumped to try to
   get crop prices up - even with the dustbowl we had enough food overall
   to feed ourselves, what we had was a severe maldistribution.

   very well. His father was able to find a job whenever the former
   employer went under. But his Dad was white, young, handsome, healthy,
   well educated, and extraordinarily charming. Even so, the family had to
   move very often to find employment. His mother filled in by giving
   bridge lessons. She talked about teaching a room-full of women while
   worrying that the furniture would be repossessed during the lesson.

   Wherever they lived during the Depression their rented house or
   apartment was likely to be burglarized whenever they were gone for the
   evening.  The thieves most often took only food.

   Is that sad or what?

   for work took me to Glasgow, a tiny city in the northeast corner of the

   I went thru it... most of the T-Rex fossils come from the area but they
   have a section about the dam.  I wouldn't call Montana a hot bed of
   democratic latte sipping BMW driving liberalism however:

   [891]http://www.fortpeckdam.com/...

   FDR is credited with providing 11,000  jobs to starving families and
   individuals in the depression to build the impressive Fort Peck dam
   which provides clean hydro electric power in the state and outside the
   state and they state their gratitude  to FDR for it.

   They were clear that these people were starving which is stated in the
   museum and it is likely many people who still live in the state  owe
   their existence and parents/grandparents survival on FDR.

   Stossel is just being evil so he can continue to pocket a big paycheck.

   Recommended by:

     American pollster and political scientist Samuel Popkin coined the
     term "low-information" in 1991 when he used the phrase
     "low-information signaling" in his book The Reasoning Voter:
     Communication and Persuasion in Presidential Campaigns.
     Low-information signaling referred to cues or heuristics used by
     voters, in lieu of substantial information, to determine who to vote
     for. Examples include voters liking Bill Clinton for eating at
     McDonald's, and perceiving John Kerry and Barack Obama as elitist
     for wind-surfing and golfing respectively...
     Also in September (2012), the NBC program Saturday Night Live ran a
     mock public service announcement featuring undecided low-information
     voters asking questions such as "When is the election?" and "Who is
     the president right now? Is he or she running?"

   In the Batman movie installment featuring Heath Ledger as the Joker,
   there is a scene where the Joker kills a local mobster, leaving the
   mobster's three henchmen alive.

   The Joker goes: "Now, our operation is small, but [grabs a pool stick]
   there's a lot of potential for aggressive expansion. So, which of our
   fine gentlemen would like to join our team? Oh! There's only one spot
   open right now, so we're gonna have tryouts. [breaks the stick in two,
   throws the pointy end on the floor in between three of Gambol's
   henchmen] Hm'make it fast."

   Conservatives, and particularly Fox, are enamored with this type of
   "jungle law situation", for it means lower wages for the former, and
   good ratings for the latter.

   For all their accusations of Obama pinning people against one another,
   the reality is: this is a conservative thing.

   It's a good picture of Great Depression breadlines, but the stories it
   often illustrates in DKos are always about American poverty. It's

   My Dad grew up during the depression and says that after my grandfather
   lost his job they often only had broth and a slice of bread for dinner.
    He said that was common among the families in his neighborhood.
   Things improved a little once my grandfather got a job with the WPA.

   When my dad graduated form high school in 1938 there were no jobs so he
   joined the navy and sent most of his pay to his parents to help them
   and his younger brothers get by.  He survived Pearl Harbor and spent
   most of the war on a destroyer in the Pacific.  When he got out he went
   to college on the GI Bill. That government program helped create the
   middle class that brought prosperity to many.

   Despite what the Republicans want to believe, the facts demonstrate
   that government programs play an important role in the creation of
   prosperity.
