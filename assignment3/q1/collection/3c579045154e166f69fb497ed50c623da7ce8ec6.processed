   President Obama took a victory lap--at long last--about the formation
   of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on his watch and, more
   specifically, the Senate confirmation last week of Richard Cordray to
   head the panel, an appointment that had long been obstructed by Senate
   Republicans who withheld a vote on Cordray for years in protest of the
   creation of the agency.

   Obama wasn't shy, either, in pointing out the authors of this delay to
   listeners this morning.

     Two years ago, I nominated a man named Rich Cordray, a former
     attorney general from Ohio, to run this consumer protection bureau.
     But Republicans in the Senate refused to give him a simple
     up-or-down vote, not because they didn't think he was the right
     person for the job, but because they didn't like the law that set up
     the consumer watchdog in the first place.

   After taking a bit of a long-awaited victory lap, the president talked
   about the influence the agency already is exerting on behalf of
   consumers:

     Because of the work that's been done at the CFPB over the past two
     years, today, mortgage lenders, student lenders, payday lenders, and
     credit reporting and debt collection agencies all face greater
     scrutiny. And if they don't play by the rules, you now have
     somewhere to go to get some measure of justice. In fact, the CFPB
     has already addressed more than 175,000 complaints from every state.

   He also outlined some of the areas in which the CFPB will exert its
   watchdog role from here on out:
     * Student loans will more transparency and fact sheets before young
       people and their parents sign onto them
     * Credit card forms have become simpler and more streamlined
     * Tools have been created for veterans to assess loans and mortgage
       brokers
     * Special protections have been put in place for seniors, guarding
       against "someone who sees their homes or retirement savings as an
       easy target"
     * Six million Americans have already recovered more than $400 million
       in refunds from companies that used "unscrupulous practices"

   The agency is just one step his administration has taken to protect
   Americans and to help guard them against a rough economy, he said. And
   the economy is where his focus was at the conclusion of the address:

     You know, we've come a long way over the past four and a half years.
      Our economy's growing. Our businesses have created 7.2 million new
     jobs in the past 40 months.  We've locked in new safeguards to
     protect against another crisis and end bailouts for good.  And even
     though more work remains, our financial system is more fair and much
     more sound than it was.

     We've still got a long way to go to restore the sense of security
     that too many middle-class families are still fighting to rebuild.
     But if we keep moving forward with our eyes fixed on that North Star
     of a growing middle class, then I'm confident we'll get to where we
     need to go.

                      Remarks of President Barack Obama
                               Weekly Address
                               The White House
                                July 20, 2013

     Hi, everybody. Three years ago this weekend, we put in place tough
     new rules of the road for the financial sector so that irresponsible
     behavior on the part of the few could never again cause a crisis
     that harms millions of middle-class families.

     As part of that reform, we set up the Consumer Financial Protection
     Bureau, the first-ever independent consumer watchdog with one job:
     to protect families from that sort of behavior.

     Two years ago, I nominated a man named Rich Cordray, a former
     attorney general from Ohio, to run this consumer protection bureau.
     But Republicans in the Senate refused to give him a simple
     up-or-down vote, not because they didn't think he was the right
     person for the job, but because they didn't like the law that set up
     the consumer watchdog in the first place.

     So last year, I acted on my own to put him in charge - because
     without a director, the CFPB couldn't use all the tools at its
     disposal to protect consumers from shady mortgage lenders, or
     unscrupulous credit reporting agencies, or predatory lenders who
     targeted veterans and seniors. And I'm pleased to say that he was
     finally confirmed this week by a bipartisan vote.

     Because of the work that's been done at the CFPB over the past two
     years, today, mortgage lenders, student lenders, payday lenders, and
     credit reporting and debt collection agencies all face greater
     scrutiny. And if they don't play by the rules, you now have
     somewhere to go to get some measure of justice. In fact, the CFPB
     has already addressed more than 175,000 complaints from every state.

     Today, as part of the CFPB's "Know Before You Owe" efforts, students
     and their parents can get a simple report with the information they
     need to make informed decisions before taking out student loans -
     and more than 700 colleges have stepped up to make this information
     clear and transparent.  And if you've noticed that some credit card
     forms are actually easier to understand than they used to be, that's
     because of the work that Rich's team and others in the
     Administration have done.

     Today, veterans have the tools they need to defend against dishonest
     lenders and mortgage brokers who try to prey on them when they come
     home. Seniors are better protected from someone who sees their homes
     or retirement savings as an easy target. And thanks to the hard work
     of folks at the CFPB, so far six million Americans have gotten more
     than $400 million in refunds from companies that engaged in
     unscrupulous practices. That's money we didn't have the power to
     recover before.

     You know, we've come a long way over the past four and a half years.
      Our economy's growing. Our businesses have created 7.2 million new
     jobs in the past 40 months.  We've locked in new safeguards to
     protect against another crisis and end bailouts for good.  And even
     though more work remains, our financial system is more fair and much
     more sound than it was.

     We've still got a long way to go to restore the sense of security
     that too many middle-class families are still fighting to rebuild.
     But if we keep moving forward with our eyes fixed on that North Star
     of a growing middle class, then I'm confident we'll get to where we
     need to go.

     Thanks, and have a great weekend.

                                     ###

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [42]Tagging tips - [43]Search For Tags - [44]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 CFPB a long time coming, NO THANKS to GOP ([85]0+ / 0-)

   The consumer financial protection bureau is a giant step forward for
   all of us Americans.
   The appointment was blocked for three years by the Republicans in
   Congress. It should have been Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but the GOP in the
   Senate would not even allow her a an up or down vote.
   I blogged it on Thursday.
