       Flashpoint Global Partners

   Could they give you a better mic so I can hear you. I dialed you on my
   computer and the little screen to 100% and I still can't hear you.
   Everyone needs vacation time.

   I think I"m going to get an external mic for these things. Part of why
   we switched cameras was because the iPhone has a better mic, but I
   agree, this is still too quiet.

   Ok- let's try this. Rachel is great. There. See if this gets deleted.
   Gotta love censorship. The Left does it best.

   It is polite that when you are a guest in someones house, you don't
   insult the host. Good manners ( etiquette ) rule 101, at your mothers
   knee.

   Don't you get it? The reason why the Republicans are refusing to pass
   any bills, or refusing to tax and spend, is that they are purposefully
   trying to destroy the Federal Government to give power to the very few
   privatizers. They can make the laws in the different States that are so
   outside the Constitution that they would never be able to pass them
   under Federal law(anti-women's right to reproductive freedom, stand
   your ground, etc.). In fact, most of these one-sided State laws are
   contrary to Constitutional due process/equal protection, and therefore
   are fraudulent.

   I believe that the U.S. Congress members and State Representatives who
   pass these one-sided discriminatory laws could be tried in Federal
   Court for selling out the U.S. Constitution, as a form of "Constitution
   prostitution", or treason? Many of the GOP laws discriminatorily
   support the very rich and powerful, but the Democratic members will
   have to deal with correcting some of their own one-sided Federal and
   State legislations. Congress has to remember that all of We the People
   are your bosses, acfording to the Constitution. For you to act agaisnt
   We the People is directly opposed to your job description.

   Ok- I guess disagreements aren't allowed on this site. Free speech is
   evidently over rated per msnbc.

   Where is Rachel? I fear the plummeting ratings since Chris Hayes took
   over

   the 8:00 slot is going to be the death knell of MSNBC at least prime
   time. And, it will

   take Rachel with it. Curious that there is no mention of where she is.
   It is vacation,

   other time off, or what. No one is enlightening us and seems to
   indicate there is

   something afoot. I have little interest in watching this channel if
   this mess continues.

   Why not bring back Ed or someone to replace Hayes. He is a nice guy but
   his show is awful.

   Oh for goodness sake. If one must know what RM is doing every moment of
   her free time, try applying for a job at the NSA.

   But remember, if they start to suspect you're snooping, breaking policy
   and public privacy laws, you damn well better steal a bunch of
   government documents to leak so you can turn the "perpetrator/victim"
   table on the prosecution.

   @[52]locknpost:

   Before you try to be funny, google Melissa Harris-Perry's shameful
   editorial on whistleblower Edward Snowden. She likes the things he
   uncovered, but - by god - she wants him back in the United States to
   face a life sentence. Because MLK, Mandela and Wendy Davis...?!?

   Thank god Rachel is back soon.

   @ZandersJorg, there is a reason Snowden doesn't qualify for
   [56]Whistleblower Protection. Indeed, intentional abuse of a position
   under the umbrella of "whistleblower" to leak for fame or profit rather
   than going through proper channels to reveal an illegal, mismanagement,
   or public endangerment makes whistleblower protection advocates' jobs
   more difficult.

   Whistleblowers take their responsibility, the information they have
   secured, protocol and proper channels, and "no national or public harm"
   seriously. It is often a long, dangerous, lonely, difficult proposition
   to be a true whistleblower.

   Snowden's intentions were suspect to begin with. He ignored privacy
   laws and policies to reveal a mismanagement of security vs privacy
   policies (?) (much of what we already knew from past true
   whistleblowers but either failed to listen or missed our cue to cheer).
   He took the lazy, easy road towards fame. Snowden is no whistleblower.
   For anyone who takes whistleblowers and the advancement of
   whistleblower protections seriously to say so, appear somewhat
   hypocritical to me.

   "It's not WHAT you said honey, it's your false motive, the context, and
   HOW you chose to say it."

   Bill showing the gunz. Seriously, it's nice seeing you guys in this
   informal format. It would be nice to have you put a lavalier on Bill
   and normalize the sound. Watching on the web you get blown out of your
   eardrums when it goes from the preview to the show.

   And, what is with the Cory pic? Was I right? Is his visage watching
   over the exec prods office because he made some decision that saved the
   show?

   BTW: I'll place this here and bookmark it so I can copy it again in the
   future:

   I was in the need of a throwaway account and I chose Yahoo in 1998. At
   a loss for some string of characters, I chose a song I was listening to
   at the time: "I need a Miracle" by the Grateful Dead from Breakdown
   Street. It served its purpose and more: It survived to 2005 and beyond.
   I still have it. (I had to append a 6 digit number so don't email
   Miracle(at)youknowwhat.com, you'll just annoy somebody else.)

   In December, 2005 I was a part of a private tech forum where the
   founder of NewsVine wanted alpha testers. I agreed, but, since I did
   not know him from Adam, I used the core of my address for my UserID.
   And this is why my sign on date is "Miracle" of January, 2006 instead
   of May, 2006 when Newsvine went public.

   I didn't choose it because I thought I was fantastic.

   It is not so. It is like XKCD for [60]Randall Munroe. Just a stupid
   decision made early in web history. So that's why Miracle vs. anything
   else. I'm just too stupid to think of anything more creative.
