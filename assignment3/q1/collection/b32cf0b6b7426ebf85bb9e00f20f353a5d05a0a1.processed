       The Benghazi production was excellent. I am at a loss for Erin
       Burnett finding culpability with the Republicans. Is it just SOP
       for CNN hosts? I don't blame the RNC for their stance against your
       network.

       That was an Awesome Special. The best I've seen. Straight in face,
       no BS and leaves you wondering about things. Getting Obama
       re-elected was way more important and the Clinton Brand is like the
       GM Brand is to the Kennedy Brand. Bless their hearts....

       Remind me when CNN looked into what happened on 9/11/01 and the
       amazing time when President George Bush caught the mastermind(Bin
       Laden) behind it. Oh wait, President Bush did not catch the
       mastermind the whole 8 years he was in office. Matter of fact, he
       said that he did not give the mastermind much thought. Where was
       the cover up then? Just how did Bin Laden get out of Afghanistan
       and into Pakistan before President Bush could catch him, I keep
       forgetting Bush did not catch him? Erin, where is the investigation
       into the cover up on Bin Laden quick get away? Just how did the Bin
       Laden family get out of the USA after 9/11? When will Erin's
       investigative team look into how President Bush got Bin Laden, oh
       sorry messed up again, how President Obama got Bin Laden? During
       Erin's look at Benghazi she interviewed Senator chaffetz, one of
       the biggest critics of this President. I am waiting for the RNC
       chair to protest this investigative look at Benghazi and not let
       CNN in on the republican's debates. Keeping Erin honest, you did
       not provide specific facts to show how you came to the conclusion
       that the President put the election ahead of Benghazi, where is the
       hard facts to back up your conclusion. You conjectured that the
       President put his election before Benghazi. Great job Erin, fair
       and balanced, oh wait this is CNN, I keep messing up, thought it
       was Fox entertainment.

       You want to know what happened in Benghazi? Read this. It's from
       one of 2 CIA agents that was with the Navy Seals when they captured
       (not killed) Bin Laden. 29 of those seals are dead. The other CIA
       agent? Ambassador Chris Stevens. THIS IS NOT A JOKE! IT IS VERY
       REAL AND WE ARE ALL LIVING IT!
       I have 'contact(s)' let's say, who is in the middle east right now.
       No... he/she is not Pakistani or any other middle easterner. No..
       she/he is not muslim... yes... she/he is American and yes fighting
       over there and yes... the name(s) shall remain anonymous. For the
       past 3 months we have been conversing and now we feel it is time
       for the US citizens to understand some things about what our
       Government is doing there... and here...from inside sources of
       those who are living it and of high ranking positions. All the
       quotation marks will be direct quotes from this person(s).
       This person(s) works for a company called DynCorp Int'l, who
       according to sources is a "shell company for a US Intelligence
       agency"... try guessing which one or ones. At one point, "We
       (DynCorp Int'l) received 97% of our contracts from the US
       Government. Obama has cut us back 48%. He (is) staging is plan to
       stay in power past 2016."
       DynCorp is not military but a 'contract' company which performs in
       many functions of military. 'Guns for hire' maybe? They basically
       do the REALLY dirty work for our country. Look them up and you will
       see all kinds of fuzzy, brilliantly put together information that
       covers up the reality of their underlying mission. Remember...
       Satan always gives you a little bit of truth so you will focus on
       that and not the lies that are the foundation of his plan. When
       attempting to find the US Intelligence agency that DynCorp is a
       shell company for I met with confusion. They actually work/develop
       for the DIA, CIA, NSA, NGIA,NRO and USOC. Did you even realize we
       had so many Agency that basically all do the same thing? That's our
       tax dollars being wasted! Ok.. back away from my personal opinion.
       At this point you could shrug this off as just another military
       person(s) who is dissatisfied with Obama and has joined the
       bandwagon to 'de-throne' the wanna-be king. But read on. This
       person(s) have contacts throughout the world... He was a friend of
       Ambassador Chris Stevens. More on that shortly. When asked if there
       was inside information on Obama's plan to stay in power the comment
       was "No. It's just what I see... and hear...and know. It scares me
       Elly. I love my Country." My response to that?
       "Scares me, too... and millions of people. But we, the people, feel
       at such a loss as to how to stop this stone from rolling. Our laws
       have become so complicated that it's not as easy as staging a coupe
       or impeaching him. Even if there were enough to impeach him (which
       there is), it would take years. So my thought is exactly what I
       placed on my FB. He sets an EMP over our country and then sits back
       while the weak die off and the strong fight and then he acts like
       God and comes in to 'save' us. If this were to happen, then every
       town, city, county, state would declare martial law and then all
       that would fall under Federal jurisdiction putting Obama at the
       head of it all. There's so much that could happen but something IS
       going to happen. We ALL feel it."
       Her/His response? "Domestic terrorism. That's how it happens. Can't
       blame it on another country. The Government will say it's domestic
       terror but in actuality it's the government. When I talk to friends
       they act like I'm paranoid." Paranoid? From a person(s) who is
       living, breathing, eating fighting every day, listening, watching
       and paying attention to who is controlling what? How many people
       does it take to cry wolf and have those who believe the sheep are
       safe finally realize the sheep are being needlessly slaughtered?
       So what have we been talking about? Many things so let's break them
       down.
       EMP - very real and our Government has already deployed them in 3rd
       world countries... at times for experimenting. Example. A year or
       so ago we had a friend who had family members in Africa. While
       there, the entire town they were in was hit with a 'solar flare' or
       so we thought. It completely fried all electronics in this 'no one
       cares about it' small village and so it went unnoticed. Now I come
       to find out that in 2012, the same year, month, etc... that this
       happened, a 'Ground based' EMP was deployed in the Sudan... This
       was the likely reason for this small village being fried.
       "We have certain ground based weapons that the Gov. will only
       deploy in 3rd world countries." "China and Russia have the
       technology too. And yes it can be used stateside."
       This person(s) went on to say that "If the general public knew what
       the government does REAL TIME we would freak."
       When asked if he thought the book One Second After by William R.
       Forstchen could become a reality the comment was "It could
       happen..."
       So during all this, I was kept informed of each trip this person(s)
       took. I found it interesting and wondered why. I have come to an
       understanding that should something... such as Benghazi happen and
       these people fell, I could tell their story and try to get the
       truth out in some way. So just real quick chronology of events:
       * July "had to do a medical escort today." later "leaving here in
       an hour for Kuwait City." A few days later... "Using a sat. uplink.
       Right now my crew and I are on the Syrian border waiting for
       instructions. Hoping and praying we won't be sent in to train the
       opposition..... most are Al Qauda...." When asked how he felt about
       having to be ordered to train the enemy... the same ones that
       killed Ambassador Stevens, his response: "This job pays
       $2700/day... but no amount of money is worth it. Ambassador Chris
       Stevens was a friend of mine. We worked together in Benghazi in
       2010."
       * Later.... "We were recalled back to Kuwait. So all is well. Then
       on July 30th, "Currently beefing up security at our Embassy in
       Kabul, Afghanistan." "Been busy trying to get the station chief
       (CIA) to listen to me for the past 24 hrs."
       * Then this past week, Thursday... before it hit the news: "All
       Embassies and Consulates' in the Middle East are on high alert.
       Here in Kabul we have moved everyone to the airbase. All that is
       left are myself and my crew. The State Dept. even pulled the Marine
       detail out of here. Be me and my guys are loaded for bear.
       Intelligence says Sunday may be a bad day." My concern was for the
       information he had just given me... was it okay, was he putting
       himself at risk? "It's fine that I tell you. The Obama Admin. has
       already release all t6his to the news outlets. (I looked... only
       one small internet paper had it out at that time. The following
       morning it was splattered all over the papers). "I've let all my
       guys use the sat. phone and call loved ones. Now we are holed up on
       the roof of the Embassy playing a waiting game."
       *Friday..."We had several firebombs thrown at us today. I think
       tonight will be bad. But we're ready." Almost daylight
       here....uneventful night. Got word 10 mins ago that Monday morning
       a squad of Marines will relieve us. Just gotta make it 2 more
       days." "Just had a convo with my CIA counterpart....intel chatter
       is that there is a high probability of a terrorist attack on Sunday
       there in the U.S. Stay alert Elly!
       *Saturday... "Sometime over night the Afghan Police that guard the
       front gate to the Embassy left. Guess everyone thinks something's
       getting ready to go down. Getting day light now....there are
       usually people out in the streets now...way to quiet here. Calm b/4
       the storm?"
       *Sunday..."Just finished backing down a mortar attack. My sniper
       took him out. Just waiting now..." and "We are ok for now. I'm sure
       they didn't expect me to have my snipers on different buildings.
       Nothing has went down for several hours now and Sunday is over in
       less than 2 hours. Plus we will be relieved in 10 hours. My company
       monitors me on here. I've been told to `stand down' several times.
       But I am what I am. I will post about this administration until
       Obama is out of office." My response to that?
       "They are either tolerating you or secretly agree with you. Ya..
       makes we wonder a lot as well as millions of other people wonder
       the same thing about our government. I just don't get it. People
       KNOW how dangerous he is to the American peploe while in office...
       why is he still there? Too many Sheepies." His response..."To be
       honest, I feel that if Obama is `removed' from office we get Slow
       Jow... I've had discussions with `certain' folks who all agree that
       giving him enough rope will do the trick!
       The last time I heard from my contact(s), there was a desperate,
       angry sounding message sent. "Don't ask me how I know but the
       terror threat (this last weekend) is a hoax to draw attention away
       from the IRS and NSA scandals... and Benghazi. This comes from a
       credible source." At this point I commented that `someone had to
       plan it..." I also asked if I could use the information received in
       previous messages to try and get it out to the country that which
       is going on. I was given permission from my contact(s) as long as
       names and genders were not used.
       After I conveyed a posting I had read regarding the whole Bengahzi
       situation being a hoax and the pictures on the internet photo
       shopped, this piece of information was given to me "Chris was given
       a `hot shot'. An overdose of a sedative. I've talked to his
       brother." That's when I received the information that "DynCorp is a
       shell company for a U.S. Intelligence Agency." I began to research
       DynCorp. Further "This situation gets a lot worse than you can
       imagine. Just bare with me. WE, my crew, have been diverted to
       Yeman. Ever hear of the term "A mother eating her young?" I feel
       that's what is happening to me. Something is not right. I have
       contacts all over the world. A friend in the Mossad has told me to
       watch my back."
       When asked if I ever wondered how my contact(s) and I became F/B
       friends, I was told, "been looking for someone who was passionate
       about their rights and country...... someone who I could
       communicate things that if I told it publically it would break his
       secrecy agreement."
       I had completed this much of my posting when I was sent a message
       by my contact(s). This is where it gets really scary.
       "On May 2, 2011 Obama announced that Osama Bin Laden had been
       killed in his compound in Pakistan. Within 94 days after this
       announcement, 5 of the top leaders of Al Qaeda were assassinated by
       drone strikes and wetwork. Hypothetically speaking.... What if Bin
       Laden was not killed but captured, sedated, put in a bodybag and
       transported to a Class 3 Black Prison off the coast of South
       Carolina. Where he was chemically interrogated. Then let's say on
       May 11, 2011, after all info had been gotten... he was given a `hot
       shot'... cremated. Did you know that there were 2 CIA agents witht
       eh Seals that night? One was Chris Stevens (Ambassador Chris
       Stevens)...hmmm.... Did you also know that since May 2, 2011 that
       29 Seals that were involved with Bin Laden have been killed also?
       Hmmmmm The operation's call sign was Extortion 17."
       So there you have it. The contact(s) I have know this information
       first hand. They know who the other CIA agent was and we all fear
       for his life. We need to spread this as quickly as possible. Print
       it off, save it to your computers, email it, facebook it. This
       SHOULD NOT BE LEFT BEHIND. It shows Obama for the liar he is, his
       administration for the corruptness they have made prevalent in our
       beautiful America and it's time to bring it back the way it was...
       I hold this accounting to be true to the best of my knowledge and
       sources. If I should die because of spreading this truth then I die
       with truth and the truth shall set you free. Benjamin Franklin
       said, "The truth may not make you many friends, but it will make
       you the right ones." I hold by that... do you?

       Where was this special when Obama was running for re-election? CNN
       avoided this topic when it happen, when President ran for second
       term;and shortly after complete silence.
       Now a year later, very sad for the 4 wonderful men that lost their
       lives. What a shame for the families.
       I urge you to keep pushing on this! Let us not forget Obama's
       famous speech as part of campaign "We have them on the run"; who is
       running now?
       Please keep this topic on the front!,

       This is such a tragedy on so many levels. How could the State
       Department IGNORE a request from Ambassador Stevens for more
       security prior to this attack? Other countries pulled out of
       Benghazi - why not the U.S.? "The only Western Flag that was still
       flying in Benghazi"...unbelievable. Clinton and Obama did a lot of
       dancing to avoid exposing their role in both the disaster and the
       cover up afterwards.

       No matter how low key it was our men did not have the support they
       should have and this lays at the feet of Secretary of State Hillary
       Clinton. They tried to hush it up, but our men ask for help and it
       was denied.
