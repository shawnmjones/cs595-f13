   A fire official drives through the rubble of Moore Medical Center after
   a tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma, May 20, 2013. A 2-mile-wide
   (3-km-wide) tornado tore through the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore on
   Monday, killing at least 51 people while destroying entire tracts of
   homes, piling cars atop one another, and trapping two dozen school
   children beneath rubble. REUTERS/Gene Blevins (UNITED STATES - Tags:
   ENVIRONMENT DISASTER) - RTXZUNI
   A rescue worker in front of the now-destroyed Moore Medical Center
   Updates on the devastating tornado that struck Moore, Oklahoma,
   yesterday:
     * The National Weather Service has confirmed the tornado as an EF-5,
       the top designation of the Enhanced Fujita scale. A preliminary
       track of the tornado can be found [29]here. Windspeeds were in
       excess of 200 mph; the track itself is [30]17 miles long and as
       wide as 1.3 miles.
     * The state medical examiner's office has lowered the number of
       confirmed fatalities from 51 to 24, reflecting apparent miscounts
       in the previous figures. Other outlets, citing the Oklahoma City
       medical examiner's office, have reported fatality counts of [31]at
       least 91 people. Over two hundred are known to be injured, and
       "thousands" of Moore residents [32]have been left homeless.
     * Former governor Frank Keating says that as many as 20,000 families
       [33]could be displaced.
     * Facebook pages have been set up by volunteers seeking to return
       [34]found photographs, documents and other scattered belongings to
       their owners--as well as [35]lost pets.
     * Fire Chief Gary Bird says he is "[36]98 percent sure" there are no
       more survivors or bodies to be recovered, but that searches will
       continue until each damaged building has been searched three times.
     * At the Children's Hospital at OU Medical Center, "[37]a facility
       used to seeing one or two traumas a day all of a sudden had over
       50."
     * NASA video of the storm's development [38]via the GOES-13
       satellite.
     * The National Guard and Air National Guard provided [39]over 200
       soldiers, many equipped with thermal imaging sensors and other
       rescue technology. FEMA has requested search and rescue teams from
       as far away as [40]California.
     * Oklahoma City Thunder star Kevin Durant pledged $1 million for
       relief efforts; now the NBA and player's union have announced
       [41]they will match that amount.
     * Video: [42]Woman finds her dog (alive) in the rubble during live TV
       interview. More information on a dog seen in a previous picture:
       the Oklahoma County Sheriff's office reports the dog [43]in this
       picture "was guarding its deceased owner. Taken to shelter; deputy
       plans on adopting."
     * [44]How to help. [45]How to apply for federal assistance through
       FEMA.
     * While attention is focused on the devastating Moore tornado, more
       storms and unstable weather continue [46]throughout the region.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [61]Civil
   Rights, [62]Community, [63]Congress, [64]Culture, [65]Economy,
   [66]Education, [67]Elections, [68]Energy, [69]Environment, [70]Health
   Care, [71]International, [72]Labor, [73]Law, [74]Media, [75]Meta,
   [76]National Security, [77]Science, [78]Transportation, or [79]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([80]California, [81]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 First 51 fatalities reported, then 24? ([84]8+ / 0-)

       Odd (but gratifying) to see the number go down, but it's completely
       understandable in the chaotic aftermath of such a horrific event
       that hard facts might be difficult to come by.
       I wonder if that's analogous to the chaotic aftermath of other
       horrific events?

 It bothers me that a "body count" is significant ([95]0+ / 0-)
       somehow. I suppose we need some measure of perspective but many
       media outlets focus on the number and I find it dismaying at best.

       Think about the total loss of a sense of control from those who
       experienced it -- and those of us who sweated it long-distance.
       Many of them were here, refreshing Weatherdude diaries for hours on
       end.
       Having a concrete fact (EF-5, n casualties, humane anecdotes, et
       al.) gives one at least some connection to this awful reality.  It
       provides an anchor to empathy.
       The rescued pup, the surprisingly alive youngsters, the fact of an
       emergency vet nearby, the 'miracle' of lower numbers of dead than
       we'd been led to believe.
       It's also a sad reminder that many don't care about the distress of
       others:  if it hadn't happened to them, it wasn't real.  That's not
       much of a problem here, thankfully.

       Upper level winds from the southwest. The upper level winds were
       much stronger than the lower level winds, creating vertical shear.
       Because the winds flowing in from the bottom are a different
       direction than the outflow the storms develop in a way that most
       people wouldn't expect.

       stay-at-home parents, unemployed people, grandpas, night-shift
       workers.
       And, there were workers and patients at the Medical Center that
       went from 2 stories to 1, the theater, bowling alley, and other
       local businesses that you would find around residential
       neighborhoods. There were two elementary schools leveled by the
       storm, with many of the students evacuated before the storm hit.
       Lots of people could have died.

 there's actually a great deal of ([208]0+ / 0-)
       observational research into time of day and disasters. If there has
       to be one, especially one that tears through a mostly residential
       area, early to mid-afternoon is one of the "best time" for lower
       death tolls, even accounting for the unemployed, retirees, and so
       on. A population well aware of the hazards that face them also
       helps a great deal. this same tornado in another part of the
       country would have been much much worse, even accounting for time
       of day, and this same tornado would have been way way worse for a
       lot of people just 2 hours later during and after the evening rush.
       the link is to a [209]word file that while long does go into it.
       FEMA and state emergency management agencies actually done a huge
       amount of modeling and research on this over the years---backed up
       by lots of observation (so it's not just a computer spitting back
       out info.) and it's actually a pretty big area of research in most
       places.

   And living in Moore, which was also hit in 1999 and 2003, you find

 Alex Jones ([256]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [257]drmah

     On the May 21 edition of The Alex Jones Show, a caller asked Jones
     whether he was planning to cover how government technology may be
     behind a recent spate of sinkholes. After laying out how insurance
     companies use weather modification to avoid having to pay ski
     resorts for lack of snow, Jones said that "of course there's weather
     weapon stuff going on -- we had floods in Texas like 15 years ago,
     killed 30-something people in one night. Turned out it was the Air
     Force."

     Following a long tangent, Jones returned to the caller's subject.
     While he explained that "natural tornadoes" do exist and that he's
     not sure if a government "weather weapon" was involved in the
     Oklahoma disaster, Jones warned nonetheless that the government "can

 Chris Matthews more than usually annoying -- he ([262]0+ / 0-)

   kept repeating to various people he was interviewing about the OK
   tornados (to which he devoted his show today), when asking about how
   the tornados may relate to climate, "no politics!". I suppose that
   meant that the words "climate change" should not be uttered.

   Yes, we should be focused on emergency assistance to those in need. But
   making it taboo to mention the underlying reasons for the increasing
   litany of climate related disasters is no different than making it
   taboo to mention the need for gun control after the latest mass
   shooting. There is no better time to help the fox-washed public connect
   the dots than in the wake of a disaster such as this. If not now, when?

 westboro blames the tornado ([280]0+ / 0-)

   on Kevin Durant for being supportive of Jason Collins!?!?!

   sorry if this is already posted.

     Phelps posted, "OK Thunder's Durant flips God by praising f--
     Collins. God smashes OK. You do the math."

 Grew Up in Oklahoma ([284]0+ / 0-)

   Now in NYC -- although the politics are wacky, Oklahomans are some of
   the kindest and most generous people you could ever meet and I STILL
   miss the amazing sunsets on the plains.  My heart aches for the lost
   and disrupted lives. Okies are tough though.
