   Nicholas Stern has been a lecturer at the University of Oxford, a
   professor of Economics at the University of Warwick and the London
   School of Economics, chief economist and special counsellor to the
   president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
   World Bank chief economist, second permanent secretary at H.M.
   Treasury, and head of Britain's Government Economic Service. Since 2008
   he has been chair of the [29]Grantham Research Institute on Climate
   Change and the Environment at the [30]London School of Economics, and
   in July he will become [31]president of the British Academy. In that
   curious British tradition, he also has been made a baron, and therefore
   is referred to as a lord.

   In 2005, the British government asked Stern to lead a team of
   economists in preparing a review of the economic impacts of climate
   change. The [32]Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change is the
   seminal work on the issue, and it is an overwhelming read. But he now
   says it is dated. He now says it underestimated the dangers and the
   damages. Last week, he succinctly [33]summarized his new understanding
   of the depth and intensity of the climate crisis:

     It is increasingly likely that hundreds of millions of people will
     be displaced from their homelands in the near future as a result of
     global warming.

   More specifically:

     "When temperatures rise to that level, we will have disrupted
     weather patterns and spreading deserts," he said. "Hundreds of
     millions of people will be forced to leave their homelands because
     their crops and animals will have died. The trouble will come when
     they try to migrate into new lands, however. That will bring them
     into armed conflict with people already living there. Nor will it be
     an occasional occurrence. It could become a permanent feature of
     life on Earth."

   Almost two years ago, I wrote that [34]climate change is the most
   important issue humanity has ever faced. As Stern's words make clear,
   the crisis has only grown worse. The research and reports come in
   almost daily.

   On Monday, a British newspaper reported on [35]America's first climate
   refugees. That same day, British and Australian scientists
   [36]announced that without climate mitigation, more than half of all
   plant species and one third of all animal species will lose more than
   half of their climatic range by 2080, with [37]biodiversity declining
   almost everywhere. On Wednesday, came news that after a year that saw
   privately insured property losses of $35 billion, which is $11 billion
   and almost 50 percent above the past decade's average, the insurance
   industry [38]accepts the scientific reality that by burning fossil
   fuels humans are causing climate change, which the industry expects to
   get worse. On Wednesday, we also had [39]this:

     "We are in the midst of dramatic assault on the security of the food
     supply," said Dr. Robert S. Lawrence, director of the Center for a
     Livable Future, part of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
     Health. The group promotes ecological research into the nexus of
     diet, food production, environment and human health.

     The primary culprit of all this menu mayhem is climate change, which
     is choking off certain crops already weakened by both genetic
     tinkering and chemically based farming, some experts contend.

   A couple weeks ago, the [40]World Meteorological Organization announced
   that 2012 was the ninth hottest year on record, and the years 2001-2012
   were among the hottest thirteen on record. That same week, the
   [41]Scripps Institute of Oceanography reported that atmospheric carbon
   dioxide had reached levels not seen [42]since before humans existed, a
   time when the Arctic was a stunning [43]14 degrees Fahrenheit warmer
   than it is now.

   And the climate crisis is growing worse.

   Join me below the fold to find out more.

   The scientists are sounding the [44]alarm:

     "I wish it weren't true, but it looks like the world is going to
     blow through the 400-ppm level without losing a beat," said Scripps
     geochemist Ralph Keeling, who has taken over the Keeling Curve
     measurement from his late father. "At this pace we'll hit 450 ppm
     within a few decades."

   And the scientists are sounding [45]alarmed:

     "This is another global emissions target that we've blown past
     without doing anything," said Jim Butler, director of global
     monitoring at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory. "Stronger
     storms, droughts, rising seas. We are already seeing the impacts of
     increased CO2 in the atmosphere ... How much further can we really
     go?"

   Because the scientific evidence is [46]alarming:

     "The next big emissions target is 450 ppm," Butler said. "That's the
     one the IPCC [The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
     Change] warns we really don't want to rise above. Based on our
     current rate of emissions, we could be there in 25 years. That's a
     scary prospect."

   That global warming and climate change are happening, and that people
   are causing it, long has been settled science. Over a year ago, I
   compiled a list of the national and international scientific bodies
   that were on the record [47]verifying this scientific reality:

     National Academies of Sciences, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
     Administration, American Association for the Advancement of Science,
     National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), American
     Physical Society, American Geophysical Union, American Chemical
     Society, American Meteorological Society, Geological Society of
     America, American Institute of Biological Sciences, American Society
     of Agronomy, American Society of Plant Biologists, American
     Statistical Association, Association of Ecosystem Research Centers,
     Botanical Society of America, Crop Science Society of America,
     Ecological Society of America, Natural Science Collections Alliance,
     Organization of Biological Field Stations, Society for Industrial
     and Applied Mathematics, Society of Systematic Biologists, Soil
     Science Society of America, University Corporation for Atmospheric
     Research, Science Academies of the G8+5 (Canada, France, Germany,
     Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, United States, Brazil, China,
     India, Mexico and South Africa), European Academy of Sciences and
     Arts, Australian Institute of Physics, and International Union of
     Geodesy and Geophysics

   And this week, [48]the most comprehensive analysis ever conducted of
   the peer-reviewed scientific literature on global warming revealed that
   of those works that rendered an opinion, 97 percent agreed with the
   consensus that [49]humans are causing it. As [50]Greg Laden summarized:

     This is not the first study to look at this question, but it is the
     most thorough effort. This should, however, be the last paper to
     report this kind of research because, really, we're there; climate
     scientists are in very strong agreement about this issue and with
     this landmark study further demonstration of this fact is
     superfluous.

   There is no legitimate debate. The science is conclusive. The
   traditional media [51]continue to [52]ignore and [53]distort and
   [54]obfuscate to [55]a degree that no longer can be dismissed as mere
   [56]incompetence, and increasingly suggests something [57]much worse,
   but the science is conclusive. There is no legitimate debate.

   As the 2005 Stern Review explicitly delineated, the impacts of climate
   change will be devastating. And given that we are talking about
   literally the entire planet, those impacts encompass and include all
   other issues. All other issues cannot even begin to be resolved without
   first placing them in the context of a potentially disastrously
   changing climate. The bullet points make clear that [58]climate issues
   include all issues.

   Poverty and wealth disparity?

     All countries will be affected by climate change, but the poorest
     countries will suffer earliest and most.

   Immigration, emigration, refugees and human rights?

     By the middle of the century 200 million may be permanently
     displaced due to rising sea levels, heavier floods and drought.

   And of course, that includes all the international security issues
   involved in hundreds of millions of people needing new places to live.
   It includes the massive potential for the spread of pandemic diseases,
   and incomprehensible burdens on health care systems and other basic
   infrastructures. It includes traditionally privileged populations and
   demographics taking advantage of their traditional privileges to best
   survive what the traditionally dispossessed will most suffer.

   National security?

   In March, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, and former
   commander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe and U.S. Naval Forces Africa,
   offered his [59]perspective:

     America's top military officer in charge of monitoring hostile
     actions by North Korea, escalating tensions between China and Japan,
     and a spike in computer attacks traced to China provides an
     unexpected answer when asked what is the biggest long-term security
     threat in the Pacific region: climate change.

     Navy Admiral Samuel J. Locklear III, in an interview at a Cambridge
     hotel Friday after he met with scholars at Harvard and Tufts
     universities, said significant upheaval related to the warming
     planet "is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen .
     . . that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely
     than the other scenarios we all often talk about.''

     "People are surprised sometimes," he added, describing the reaction
     to his assessment. "You have the real potential here in the
     not-too-distant future of nations displaced by rising sea level.
     Certainly weather patterns are more severe than they have been in
     the past. We are on super typhoon 27 or 28 this year in the Western
     Pacific. The average is about 17."

   And the [60]Stern Review also included the economic consequences of the
   climate crisis:

     Unabated climate change could cost the world at least 5% of GDP each
     year; if more dramatic predictions come to pass, the cost could be
     more than 20% of GDP.

   In a nutshell:

     Climate change is the greatest and widest-ranging market failure
     ever seen.

   Of course, actually facing up to the climate crisis could have the
   opposite effect:

     Shifting the world onto a low-carbon path could eventually benefit
     the economy by $2.5 trillion a year.

   And Stern already had addressed the risk to biodiversity, plants and
   animals:

     Warming of 2C could leave 15-40% species facing extinction.

   As I explained in March, [61]the climate itself is migrating. But in
   January, Stern admitted his famous Review had been [62]wrong:

     Lord Stern, author of the government-commissioned review on climate
     change that became the reference work for politicians and green
     campaigners, now says he underestimated the risks, and should have
     been more "blunt" about the threat posed to the economy by rising
     temperatures.

     In an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Stern, who is
     now a crossbench peer, said: "Looking back, I underestimated the
     risks. The planet and the atmosphere seem to be absorbing less
     carbon than we expected, and emissions are rising pretty strongly.
     Some of the effects are coming through more quickly than we thought
     then."

     The Stern review, published in 2006, pointed to a 75% chance that
     global temperatures would rise by between two and three degrees
     above the long-term average; he now believes we are "on track for
     something like four ". Had he known the way the situation would
     evolve, he says, "I think I would have been a bit more blunt. I
     would have been much more strong about the risks of a four- or
     five-degree rise."

   There is no scientific debate about anthropogenic climate change, but
   there is political debate. Part of that is due to the failures and
   complicity of the traditional media. Most of it is due to the failures
   and corruptions of the world's economic and political systems. Climate
   change should be something the entire world is working on together, to
   address and mitigate. But it isn't. In the United States, the
   [63]Republican Party is at [64]war on science itself, which is
   [65]beginning to cause a war within the Republican Party itself. But
   that means there is an [66]enormous political opportunity for the
   Democrats, if they truly took the lead by following where the science
   leads.

   Climate change is scientific reality. It is an unprecedented global
   crisis. It shouldn't be political, but it is. And that means that by
   doing the right thing, by doing what is necessary, by doing what the
   scientific facts demand, by doing what the health of the planet
   demands, the Democratic Party could reap unimaginable political
   rewards. But not to do so would mean much worse than political failure.
   Because in addressing this crisis, without excuse or compromise, all of
   humanity cannot afford to fail.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [82]Civil
   Rights, [83]Community, [84]Congress, [85]Culture, [86]Economy,
   [87]Education, [88]Elections, [89]Energy, [90]Environment, [91]Health

   [97]National Security, [98]Science, [99]Transportation, or [100]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([101]California, [102]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there
   are many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       We still have a billion years or so until the sun heats up and
       expands into a red giant. Hopefully we won't have to deal with any
       large asteroids or comets or super volcanoes before that. If none
       of those things happen in the next few hundred million years or so
       we need to start getting concerned.

       should be to get off this one rock that supports us.  We are just

       IMO disastrous climate change is a forgone conclusion and we will
       live or die as a species based on whether we have the ability to
       relocate or colonize other worlds.
       Will that happen in time?  Probably not.

       ...[244]Gerard K. O'Neill!!
       That's my best Monty Python imitation.
       Screw colonizing worlds, let's build our own!  The cool thing is,
       with advances in robotics, we'll have bots build them for us.
       That's a while away, though.  We need to solve the problem of
       global warming, which we can do.  Putting in new technologies to
       replace fossil fuels isn't rocket science.  Only the political will

   should be to clean up our act here on Earth. The most inhospitable
   place on Earth that humans can inhabit (including Antarctica) is more
   conducive to human existence than anywhere else in the solar system.
   Unless we experience a runaway greenhouse effect, and we become like
   Venus, there is no advantage to moving off Earth. I have nothing
   against space exploration, including going to Mars, but offworld
   settlement is no panacea. Colonies on other worlds will probably do OK
   as long as the population doesn't become excessive. Overpopulation and
   the failure to control our wastes are what have led us to the state we
   are in.

       The analogy to a cancer has some appeal, part of one's own self
       attacking - but, a parasite is probably more accurate. Mindlessly
       attacking the host with no concern whatsoever that at some point
       the host will die and be unable to support the colony.
       Of course, the parasite is a very lose analogy also, and a
       parasite's species can continue on another host - us. . .?

       At least that's the way I think about it (as a cancer survivor).
       And the first rule of parasites is: DO NOT KILL HOST!
       "Parasite" is just another way of saying that our bodies and the
       bodies of all other living beings, plant, animal, algae, bacteria,
       whatever, are interrelated and interdependent. The fantasy that
       humans can outlive the biosphere (perhaps by migrating to Mars or
       another galaxy somewhere) is seductive but dangerous. (Not to
       mention the amount of fossil fuel that would have to be burned to
       do all the experiments to try to achieve it.)

       as much as many cancer victims like to think of it as something
       foreign -- it's certainly not under the control of the person who
       has cancer -- but that's also true of a large number of other
       diseases. True, some cancers are caused by viruses, but cancer is
       truly a breakdown in normal cellular control.
       OTOH, our species seems to have outlived our capacity to adapt. Our
       instinctive need to acquire (which certainly, up to a point,
       confers survival advantage), when unchecked by sufficient negative
       feedback or external restrictions, becomes highly destructive
       greed. Perhaps it's a meter of our intelligence not evolving as
       fast as our ability to develop tools and technology. We appear to
       be reaching the stage of a breakdown in the ability of our species
       intelligence to save ourselves.
       So, we are literally destroying ourselves as a species, and taking
       a huge number of others species with us over the cliff, because we
       are stubbornly resistant to putting any restrictions on unchecked
       greed.
       Maybe calling ourselves parasitic is a useful metaphor. But it
       hardly helps to solve the problem. Mitt Romney is a supreme
       parasite, and maybe that recognition helped to keep him out of
       office, but Barack Obama is still possibly poised to approve KXL.
       Somehow I suspect that even when we are dying prematurely by the
       tens or hundreds of millions because of famine and lack of safe
       water and rampant disease -- all of which may come to pass within
       the lifetimes of those already living -- the richest and most
       powerful will never willingly relinquish their prerogative to
       destroy for personal gain.

       that bete noir of conservatives. Living things don't destroy
       themselves because they have evolved regulatory systems, feedback
       controls, for all their life processes. These regulations aren't
       perfect; sometimes they break down, as in cancerous growth. But
       they work well enough to permit life to exist.
       Humans have not yet evolved these sorts of controls to prevent
       planetary overgrowth. Any technological civilization that lasts
       long enough to make itself known over interstellar distances must
       have evolved such regulation without going extinct in the process.
       Perhaps none exist in nearby. Or perhaps the kind of regulation
       needed makes them unwilling to help those who haven't evolved such
       regulation.

     1. Keystone XL: An expansion of the existing Keystone pipeline from
     Canada, through the central US to Port Arthur, Texas, where the
     crude oil can be refined or loaded onto oil tankers for the global
     market.

     2. Enbridge pipeline: A proposed route over the Rocky Mountains,
     across Canadian boreal forests, wild watersheds, and indigenous
     territory to the marine port at Kitimat, British Columbia for
     export. And:

     3. Kinder-Morgan TMX Trans-Mountain pipeline: Also over the Rocky
     Mountains, into the port of Vancouver, British Columbia. This
     pipeline/tanker route is already operating and Kinder Morgan has
     applied for an expansion. In 2010, 71 large oil tankers shipped tar
     sands crude oil through the Port of Vancouver and the Georgia Strait
     to global markets.

     [526]The World's Biggest Carbon Bomb

     From Bill McKibben:
     Tar sands mining has wrecked native land in Alberta; endangers
     farms, wild areas, and aquifers along its prospective route; and
     poses a danger to the whole planet. Keystone XL is one of three
     pipeline routes that lead back to the world's biggest carbon bomb,
     so we're working in solidarity with the indigenous people and other
     citizens in Canada."

   And I was told I was "lying and spreading misinformation" here on this
   blog because I wrote that 54,000 square miles of boreal forest were
   being destroyed.

       There was a great article in the Atlantic a year ago or so about
       the fact that one of the hardest things to overcome inaction
       concerning climate change is the fact that there are "winners" with
       a changing climate - namely the already rich countries (though
       debatable) and the northern  Canada, Scandinavia, Russia.
       There is no question there will be far more "losers" and that
       humanity as a whole will "lose" but it is just added difficulty
       when a few see global warming as a "win."

       There are countries and corporations that will make a lot of money
       along the way -- but in the longer run we all rely on the same
       interconnected systems, and can't outlive the biosphere we depend
       on. Australia, for example, can make a lot of money right now
       selling coal to China -- but is being consumed by wildfires driven
       by drought and temperature increases. That's not an especially
       appealing trade-off, IMO.

       As I re-read my comment, it does sound like I am stating that there
       will be countries benefitting into the distant future.
       I was unclear about 2 things. The article was not talking about
       those that can make a fortune based upon selling carbon based crap
       - though they are the biggest impediment - it was only listing
       countries that benefit by a warmer world, the best example (that
       they conclude) is Canada and Scandinavia where the open water ports
       to the north will allow quicker trans-oceanic routes and will have
       increased land available for farming and such.
       And, I was unclear in that I don't agree that even those countries
       will is a "win", never mind the rest of the world. There are lots
       of complex considerations that the simple supposition that
       trade/increased ag do not take into account. One of which is
       pointed out by Lawrence and that is the military conflicts that
       might well ensue against a country like Canada that has previously
       enjoyed a relatively stable existence in its isolated geography.
       Anyway, thought I would kind of clear up the point I was making,
       that some countries truly believe they are "winners" in a warmer
       world - I don't, the planet's impact cannot be predicted so simply
       and that doesn't even take into account the volatility of humans,
       and desperate humans at that.

       That statement is wrong on so many levels.
       We need more clean energy, not more oil.
       The Keystone XL pipeline "oil" is, first of all, not oil, and
       second, not for us.  It will be refined (more pollution) in and
       around Port Arthur and sold on the world market.  The U.S. may buy
       it, but it won't be cheap - we will have paid for it many times

 the problem with ([608]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [609]DSPS owl

   identifying Canadian tar sands as "the biggest carbon bomb" is that, as
   a practical matter, it's not true.  Over the next 20 years (which is
   really all that matters now . . . if we're not already past the point
   of no return now we certainly will be in 20 years) Canadian tar sands
   will be at worst a minor contributor to global CO2 emissions.  Coal is,
   and will remain, #1 . . . and world oil consumption/supply will not be
   diminished in the slightest even if the entire tar sands operation is
   shut down completely.

   Tar sand extraction is incredibly "dirty", especially as it is
   practiced now, and should be stopped for that reason alone.  But its
   impact on the global warming crisis is essentially zero.  Focusing on
   it as some sort of "cure" is a distracting side show that will only
   delay facing up to what really needs to be done.

 tar sand production ([665]0+ / 0-)
       is running somewhere around 1.5 million barrels/day, while world
       oil production is around 90 million.  There is sufficient "excess

       completely replace tar sand production.  The "pollution penalty"
       for tar sand production is certainly higher than for other sources,
       but it is by no means a "game changer" in terms of global warming.
       I'm not arguing for tar sand production, but this is a diary about

       they know what they are talking about. You are leaving out the
       environmental destruction of a carbon sink and a source of fresh
       water. You only discuss the supply and "pollution penalty."

     Of the total 168.7 billion barrels of proven bitumen reserves, about
     80 percent is considered recoverable by in-situ methods and 20
     percent by surface mining methods.  Oil sands within 75 meters of
     the surface can be mined; whereas, oil sands below this threshold
     must be extracted using in-situ methods.
     In 2011, Alberta's production of crude bitumen reached over 1.7
     million bbl/d; of this surface mining accounted for 51 percent and
     in-situ for 49 percent.  In 2011, about 57 percent of crude bitumen
     production was sent for upgrading to SCO in the province.

       This was one of your best LL - and that is saying something.
       As I read, all I could think of was the wealth and power literally
       "invested" into the status quo. We can readily see how much power
       by the fact that we are even having a "debate" about the issue - so
       important is the "debate" that the powerful must denigrate science
       generally (evolution, "liberal professors").
       As I read, all I could think of was that there needed to be an
       investment opportunity - for the already rich in carbon - to even
       get them to contemplate changing. I know that sounds sick, it IS
       sick, but I see no other way. The only way to enlist the power
       wealth driving the status quo is assure their wealth in the
       transition.
       It is so depressing and perhaps I am particularly cynical this
       morning but that doesn't mean it's not partly true.
       In my more conspiratorial moments, I wonder if the real engine
       driving the huge inequality that seems to be ramming through the
       world right now is the fact that the global elite know how much the
       world will be changing and it will require enormous wealth to
       ensure the survival and "comfort" of the next generations.
       Blessed are the peacemakers, the poor, the meek and the sick.

       In the gloomy scenarios (which I suspect are not gloomy enough),
       everything that we consider "civilization" -- and especially a
       reasonable stable social order -- is likely to collapse. Then the
       hand-to-hand-combat struggle for food, water, whatever will become
       fierce. Given how humans behave under duress (shipwreck, for
       example), those with guns are likely to use them to protect
       "property" meaning resources. It could get really really nasty
       quite rapidly -- more like Somalia.

       Keystone is a distraction . . . whether it gets built or not will
       have very close to no effect on world CO2 emissions over the next

       "cleaner" sources, but it won't go down, and it's at most a few
       refineries worth of production.  Refineries scheduled to process
       tar sand oil will take Indonesian or Orinoco (Venezuelan) heavy
       instead, and remain in full production.  The only advantage gained
       is avoiding the energy-of-extraction of tar sand . . . and that is
       a drop in the bucket of worldwide production.

       Going after "The Oil Industry" or "Big Energy" won't work - too

       Keystone's going to be shipping the most carbon-intensive synthetic

 One huge problem with accepting the notion ([1155]0+ / 0-)

   Of climate change, is that the PTB have a whole arsenal of items they
   want to bring to the public - and those things will be labelled as
   "good for the planet" even if they re insidious. Those of us who fear
   being banned for bringing up one such topic, can only say, "When you
   look up at the sky, what if those plumes are not about reducing
   greenhouse gasses or deflecting the sun's heat, but about Monsanto
   having the patent for plants that are resistant to aluminum?"

   So many people around me accept really bad shit because it gets
   labelled "Green." One such item is the mercury containing light bulbs,
   in which we all re expected to pay X amount more for a light bulb.
   Industry wins in several ways - we pay more (They are NOT more
   expensive to produce) and then industry also gets to dump the mercury
   into that product. Sure it is only a tiny amount in each light bulb,
   but since tens of millions of people have bought into this, industry
   gets

   One) The profit from each  bulb
   Two) They avoid having to put the mercury into super fund containers
   and ship it off to Superfund sites, an expensive proposition.

   Already a  "scientifically done" study in England "proved" that these
   metal monstrosities produce more carbon dioxide to oxygen conversion
   than trees, and so there was clamor  in letters to the editor to cut
   down trees near roadways and put up these metal sculpture thing-ees
   instead. After all, trees are so damn messy, with their leaves and what
   not, and they also need to be trimmed. What could possibly go wrong
   inside  a world where citizens are encouraged to believe trees are evil
   and metal sculptures are good!

       The "Owners" have never wanted to be held to account for any waste
       or by-product stream. Whether the instance is nuclear waste, water
       used from industrial process, exhaust from any source or ordinary
       residential trash, we tend to grossly undervalue the benefit of
       proper waste stream management. The Private Sector largely sees no
       benefit to waste management if disposal is the cheapest option from
       the perspective of their profit margins.
       Every once in a while waste becomes a commodity: gasoline was a
       nuisance by product of the refining process for decades after crude
       displaced whale oil. But more often than not, proper and sufficient
       waste management has to be imposed.

   We're headed for a point where humans will not be able to survive on
   some parts of the earth. [1241]Thermogeddon.

     IT IS the late 23rd century. Houston, Tel Aviv, Shanghai and many
     other once-bustling cities are ghost towns. No one lives in
     Louisiana or Florida anymore, and vast swathes of Africa, China,
     Brazil, India and Australia are no-go zones, too. That's because in
     all of these places it gets hot and humid enough to kill anyone who
     cannot find an air-conditioned shelter.

     This is the nightmare scenario outlined in a study published earlier
     this year. If we carry on as we are, it claimed, in as little as a
     century a few small areas might start to get so hot in summer that
     no one could survive without air conditioning. Three centuries from
     now, up to half of the land where people live today would regularly
     exceed this limit.

     "I knew just from basic physics that there would be a point at which
     heat and humidity would become intolerable, and it didn't seem that
     anyone had looked at that from a climate change perspective," says
     Steven Sherwood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of New
     South Wales in Sydney, Australia. "When you look at the data, it
     becomes pretty clear that it wouldn't take as much climate change as
     people seem to think to hit this."

   'Clean coal' is not an oxymoron if it has carbon sequestration. There
   are 594 conventional coal fired central power stations in the US if the
   US replaced one station per week in 12 years (rate China is adding coal
   plants) we would reduce emissions by 25% (1.5 billion tons
   of CO2).
   We need a top down program of replacing coal fired power
   with CCS as soon as possible.
   Once the US adopts this technology(and not before) China and India will
   adopt it.

       Almost all experts say yes. CCS can provide 20% of the carbon cuts
       needed by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
       That requires 3,000 CCS plants. The IEA also predicts that 70% of
       the energy used between now and 2050 will come from fossil fuels,
       emphasising the importance of CCS. Without it, renewables, energy
       efficiency and nuclear power would have to significantly overshoot
       their already challenging targets.

       Why exactly is it relevant to point out that solar is at 1%? That's
       more than CCS is currently providing.
       It doesn't matter where solar is now. What matters is how much and
       how quickly we can build more. The answer is that we can build it
       faster and for less money than it would take to implement CCS on a
       large scale.
       We already cut emissions dramatically by reducing consumption and
       switching nearly half of coal production to natural gas. We could
       shut down at least 1/3 of the dirtiest coal plants in America this
       year and no one would notice the difference. Part of the problem
       for renewables is that we have excess generating capacity from
       highly polluting coal plants generating power at low prices. Those
       aging don't need to be equipped with outrageously expensive CCS.
       They need to be shut down now to make room in the market for more
       wind and solar. That could be done through aggressive EPA
       enforcement without a price on carbon.

       building a pipeline network criss-crossing the country from
       hundreds of coal plants to only a few reliable locations to store
       carbon. You could build far more wind and solar (or even nuclear)

   Carbon capture and sequestration is hugely energy intensive.  And the

   produced by that power plant).  So the big question is: When you

   removal is America's most shameful environmental crime of the century.
   No, there's no such thing as clean coal.

   Coal carbon sequestration is the most expensive way of dealing with CO2
   emissions. There's a reason no one in industry wants to invest private
   dollars in building new plants. There's a reason the few that have been
   built resulted in huge rate increases. It's a completely moronic
   non-solution. It makes no environmental or economic sense whatsoever.

 stop thinking activism, think JOBS ([1444]0+ / 0-)
       Fear isn't going to shift votes. Fear isn't going to put a green
       majority in the House. The way to work on this issue is to start
       fighting it as a jobs issue. We have to beat the Chinese or we're
       falling dangerously behind in the JOBS war. This is a clear and
       present danger.
       The choir has been singing DOOOOOM or ACT NOW since the 70s. I
       dispute none of the urgency but I don't think the strategy is going
       to work.
       I just rambled in a down stream post. I doubt the echo chamber has
       much interest. But if anyone cares to dispute my theory hopefully
       you can show me how Keystone activism presents a path towards
       retaking the House. Because even stopping Keystone, which would be
       awesome, would be like building a sand castle on the beach because
       of the overall US and global industrial footprint. The tide of the
       bill for the industrial revolution is coming in. But we're the
       movement that's been crying wolf since The Population Bomb and we
       aren't going to shift any votes with this. It has to be JOBS.

       I've followed your work here and you definitely get it. However I
       don't think we (by which I mean the overall activist community) are
       making a lot of progress in breaking down the tribal barriers
       involved. The choir does not need preaching to on this issue, we
       also get it.
       I also think that two things can be done at once. And that the
       overall Democratic Party, from the Clinton/Obama centrists to the
       left of center, have to start presenting a way forward rather than
       the politics of fear. We - and here I mean the greens and for what
       it's worth I was selling the Whole Earth Catalog over the counter
       during the Nixon Administration (under aged at the time cough ...)
       - aren't getting much electoral mileage out of "we're not the other
       psychos." People want/need to work for something. See: 2008 though
       all they/we ended up working for was rhetoric. The outside of echo
       chamber vast majority don't turn out for an inside game of inches
       (see: 2010).
       Their side uses fear to great effect. Our side has been predicting
       doooom within the next few years since the 70s - I was guilty of
       this in the 70s. Now doooom may be upon us but we aren't going to
       retake the House by making that argument. By making the JOBS FOR
       THE FUTURE argument we may have a chance. We can and should
       continue to fight Keystone and it would be great to beat it. But
       turning the great ship industrial revolution towards a sustainable
       future can't be sold to the voter through fear. We're the movement
       that cried wolf. The rest of the voters barely listen (and I'd
       lovelovelove to be wrong about this)
       We can do two things at once. Strategically fear isn't going to

       That's "a" problem. Another problem is the voters who are basically
       tribally against whatever we're for because ... [fill in rant about

       give the hippies another win. We saw that with Clinton, we're
       seeing that with Obama. See Kos's stuff on the electric car.

       I was moved by the final chapter in Alan Weisman's The World
       Without Us, where he makes a persuasive case that human survival
       becomes much easier to envision if our numbers dropped down to 1.6
       billion by 2100, rather than increasing (as currently projected) to
       9 million. Whether this happens by voluntarily curtailing births,
       by incentives that encourage curtailing births, or by increased
       deaths through starvation, drought, disease, and warfare, some sort
       of population crash seems inevitable. How it happens depends on
       human choices.
       That said, my experience is that many people (mostly affluent
       highly educated white males) who advocate "population control"
       rather than choice often end up advocating some pretty weird,
       top-down, authoritarian policies that I can't endorse. I don't have
       an easy answer to that dilemma, other than educating girls around
       the world (which demonstrably lowers birth rates), making birth
       control and early abortion cheap and available (but not mandatory),
       and dis-incentivizing the high-tech baby-making industry.

   land, water, for humanity to exist comfortably on Earth at double the

   progress be measured. Our fault lies in how we measure progress. We
   measure it in the size of the economic pie. We need to forget about the
   size of the pie.

   Neoliberal economists have been feeding us a load of bull about
   resources and growing the pie. We need a neo-neoliberal view that the
   economic pie must be shared by the entire planet, not just a few
   wealthy nations. Once we understand that there won't be any limits to
   providing the entire Earth's population with the resources to live
   comfortably.

   The problem exists with the politicians telling us, especially in the
   US that "green" is equivalent with having to live a spartan lifestyle.
   We allow ourselves to be duped into believing this nonsense. Green
   means understanding that resources are finite and "deus ex machina"
   won't save us.

   If they did, they would get behind the commercialization of safer

   technologies to replace our current crop of dangerous dinosaurs. But
   even without thorium cycle development, there are newer uranium plant
   designs that replace the dangerous pump-based cooling systems of old
   with more "Fail-Safe" passive cooling systems. (yeah, I put fail safe
   in quotes for a reason. Nothing is truly fail safe).

   Sorry, but renewables can't do it ALL. We must balance our risks. And

   "and they is us" (many will get that ref around here)

   If we could blame climate and carbon on the "other" it could have some
   political weight. China is a problem. If saber rattling at Beijing were
   worked in it might get traction. It won't work, of course, because the
   USA is a big part of the problem and has no current interest in being
   part of the solution.

   My point is above litany of doooooom isn't going to work. The green
   movement has been saying DOOOOOOM since the late 60s early 70s. Like
   the austerity crew with their economic collapse under the weight of
   welfare queens ecological disaster has been at a "tipping point act now
   or it'll be too late!!!" for 40+ years in the USA. Now one can easily
   make the argument that "this time it's real" but that's not going to
   shift a single vote.

   Fear won't work. Fear of Republican psychos isn't going to get us back
   the House in 2014 or beyond (except on immigration?). Fear of worse
   hurricanes is not going to get through to outside the echo chamber
   voters who have to worry about putting gas in their car and paying the
   rent involved in living in a suburban environment which was designed
   around unlimited personal transportation.

   Histrionic posts on the front page of Daily Kos - please note I dispute
   none of the assertions and personally believe we're heading over the
   falls in a barrel (and find ocean acidity the near term scariest
   nightmare) - are not going to shift a single vote. Without shifting
   votes we can't do anything. That's what it's like.

   A program has to be sold as JOBS and fighting back because the CHINESE
   ARE WINNING THE SOLAR RACE. There is a [DEL: missile :DEL] technology
   gap and we're losing. If we fall far enough behind then we won't be
   able to catch up (post) industrially. And the is a CLEAR AND PRESENT
   **ECONOMIC DANGER ** if we don't get started now! FDR beat the Nazis!
   If you don't sign up to move America and American JOBS forward then
   maybe you hate America.

   Justifiable panic over impending ecological tipping points is going to
   get us nowhere. It won't shift a single vote. It's like the PRESIDENT
   IS BLACK panic votes on the GOP racist front. Everyone who is aware of
   the ecological issues already votes. This issue isn't going to shift
   elections unless it is sold not as fear of impending collapse but as a
   forward looking path towards more perfect high tech 21st century
   American JOBS.

   And if we don't start radically shifting elections we won't be able to
   do anything about climate or ecological issues. And this time we may
   actually be doooomed.

   Should we form a group that asks each individual member or household to
   reduce its carbon footprint by xx amount?

   I don't know whether or not that would help.  If it were a nationwide
   effort, such as occurred both here and in Great Britain during
   WWII--I'm thinking of such things as "Victory Gardens," saving tinfoil
   and scrap metal, and so on--reducing the carbon footprint might be
   accomplished.

   Economic externalities for fossil fuel must be priced. We need a
   stable, profitable market for sustainables or they will not be

   of regulations currently for getting wind farms permitted. It takes 5
   years or more to get an offshore wind farm permitted in US waters.
   Local regulations vary all over the map.

   We are at 400ppm of CO2 and rising at the rate of almost 3 ppm per
   year. That's an increase of 50 ppm in 16+ years. However the second
   derivative is positive and the rate of increase is increasing.
   Everything about climate change seems to be the same story, we are
   exceeding worst case predictions. Does anyone think that we will not
   cruise through 450, 500, 550ppm and more without even hesitation?
   Congress needs to formulate a strategy based on physical goals and fund
   sustainable development and deployment. The only justification for
   using fossil fuels is that sustainables are not ready to power the
   nation. There is no other justification.

       "waste" is less than that from expensive to manufacture

       it is nuclear vs. coal, and you who doesn't "get it".  Coal is
       where energy, and CO2, are coming from now. Coal accounts for the
       majority of new capacity being installed as well.  There is zero
       chance of that being replaced by "renewables" soon enough to do any
       good.
       There is at least a chance that coal could be supplanted by nuclear
       in time to do some good (and it certainly wouldn't hurt to throw
       some "renewables" into the pot as well).  If it isn't, if we keep
       burning coal and oil and natural gas for another 20 years at the
       present (or higher) rate, then it's game over for global warming
       and the resulting climate change.  The whole planet transitions to
       "the other" stable climate regimen, and stays there . . . probably
       for millions of years (that's how long it lasted last time).  When
       that happens "switching to renewables" will not transition it back.

   Equivalent generation while achieving a 20% reduction in 1990 emission
   levels would require 70,000 10-MW solar thermal plants or 275,000
   2.5-MW wind turbines -- if there was no increase in US energy
   consumption beyond 2008 levels.  I don't see upwards of 5,000 solar
   thermal plants or 20,000 wind turbines installed per year.  And in
   order to stay anywhere near 400ppm CO2 concentration, a 20% reduction
   won't cut it.  We're no likelier to witness 300,000 solar thermal
   plants or 1,200,000 wind turbines by 2050 in the US than we are 1,000
   nuclear plants.

   The recent decrease back to mid-1990s emission rates in the US is a
   one-time accomplishment brought about by a confluence of factors.  Do
   most climate scientists understand the magnitude of this
   energy-emissions reality?  It's one thing to say that passing 400ppm
   without action is not a good thing.  It's quite another to grasp the
   breadth and depth of the commitment required to stay below 450ppm or
   500ppm or higher.

   The amount of resources that we will require to research, develop, and
   deploy non-fossil and non-nuclear energy generation, transmission, and
   storage infrastructure to reduce our CO2 emissions by 80% or more of
   1990 levels dwarfs the Apollo project, regardless of the time-scale
   involved.  To begin with, it requires very different policies than we
   have now.

 Your earlier diary didn't prove much of anything. ([1751]0+ / 0-)

   I used to be against nuclear power like most progressives.  I now
   realize I was wrong.  Nuclear power has to be PART of the solution to
   climate change.  It will take too long to ramp up the other
   technologies.  And it's too bad that progressives like me put the
   kibosh on nuclear power expansion years ago, or we wouldn't be in this
   mess now.

   IMO, those who are still on the nuclear power zero-tolerance kick are
   the ones not serious about climate change.

 it proved plenty ([1755]0+ / 0-)
       it proved that nukes can't be part of any solution, because we
       would need too many of them too fast, which would incur plenty of
       problems on its own, and there is no solution to the current waste
       problem, which would be greatly exacerbated.

   EPA adiministrator. That is the first order of business. You can't have
   environmental laws without someone to implement them. It will take some
   GOP Senators to let it happen.

 "Cool It" - See It ([1764]1+ / 0-)

   If you haven't seen the documentary "Cool It" which may well be on
   demand for free if you have premium cable channels, which is where I
   saw it a few months back, be sure to check it out. I have followed the
   "sustainable development movement" since pitching the idea to SONY of
   covering the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992 to make an interactive
   documentary for it's planned CD-based "edutainment" platform called
   CD-I. I attended all the preparatory conferences and saw Al Gore
   address the UN in '92 on the subject. In the "Cool It" documentary, is
   how the movement has gone 20 years into it and the documentary centers
   around Bjorn Lomborg's efforts to get much more radical and seemingly
   effective treatments for climate change going rather than wasting time
   and money as we are.

   The scientists have been reluctant to speak up about the seriousness of
   climate change and now the cat is going to be let out of the bag.
   People are going to be ultra pissed they were not respected enough to
   be told the truth.  The news media was more than culpable. But the
   entire economy lures people to do these selfish things. Now we are
   going to need an economy based on sequestering CO2 and conserving water
   as well as resources; polluters pay, restorers get the rewards and
   incentives. We can remanufacture already-used materials and leave the
   remaining resources in the ground. Whole new industries will be created
   and the economy can benefit everyone not just the few. This is where
   we're at right now.  We cannot rely on the current establishment that
   covered this up for their own enrichment. Health and equality should be
   the major drivers.
