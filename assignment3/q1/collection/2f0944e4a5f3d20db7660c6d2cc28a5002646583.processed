FAMILY PLANNING 2020

   Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) builds on the partnerships launched at
   the London Summit on Family Planning. It will sustain the momentum from
   London and ensure all partners are working together to achieve and
   support the goals and [12]commitments announced at the Summit.

   [14]Read FP2020 Director Valerie DeFillipo's blog of our first year.
   FP2020 will:
     * Track progress and report on financial and policy commitments made
       at the Summit, linking with established accountability processes
       for the UN Secretary General's Every Woman Every Child strategy;
     * Monitor and report on global and country progress toward the FP2020
       Summit goals;
     * Identify obstacles and barriers to achieving Summit goals and
       recommend solutions;
     * Ensure promotion of voluntary family planning and concrete measures
       to prevent coercion and discrimination, and ensure respect for
       human rights;
     * Ensure data availability to support all of the above, consistent
       with country processes and sharing data, such as through a global
       score card; and
     * Publish an annual report to update the global community on progress
       and challenges.

   Coordinating Structure for FP2020
     * An 18-member [15]Reference Group, initially to be chaired by the
       United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Bill & Melinda Gates
       Foundation (BMGF), and comprising of countries, donor partners,
       civil society and technical partners and agencies, to set overall
       strategic direction for FP2020, drive coordination among
       stakeholders and be accountable for reaching 120 million additional
       women by 2020.
     * A small, dedicated Task Team, reporting to the Reference Group and
       hosted by the UN Foundation, that is responsible for day-to-day
       implementation of FP2020 activities.
     * Four Working Groups, to provide technical advice and support:
       [16]Performance Monitoring & Accountability; [17]Rights &
       Empowerment; Market Dynamics; and [18]Country Engagement.
     * A high-level group of FP2020 Champions to provide leadership,
       influence and support on behalf of FP2020.
