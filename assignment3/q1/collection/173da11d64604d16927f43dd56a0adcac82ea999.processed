[24]Boehnerland on GOP debt limit plan: 'No decisions anytime soon'

   U.S. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) pauses during remarks to the
   American Conservative Union's annual Conservative Political Action
   Conference (CPAC) in Washington, February 9, 2012.
   &nbsp;REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS)
   Well, [30]this is great news for fans of government by hostage crisis:

     Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said the Ohio Republican is
     "talking with members, and the American people, about the best way
     to increase the debt limit consistent with the Boehner rule," which
     he said demands spending cuts equal to or greater than the amount of
     a debt-limit increase. "No decisions will be made anytime soon,"
     Steel said.

   We're going to hit the statutory debt limit in less than three weeks,
   after which the only thing separating the country from default will be
   extraordinary actions taken by the Treasury Department. In other words,
   not making a decision anytime soon is a really bad idea.

   And as far as "talking with ... the American people," I'd like to know
   exactly which people Boehner is talking with. Last I checked, the
   American public overwhelmingly [31]disagreed with the GOP's strategy of
   using the debt limit to force spending cuts. Yet we continue to hear
   things like this from Republicans:

     "The president is not going to get a straight vote to raise the debt
     ceiling," said Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican. "It
     is just not politically possible. There has to be some barter
     framework that involves significant deficit reduction."

   It's amazing to hear Republicans continue to spout nonsense like that,
   especially given that President Obama has already gone more than
   halfway towards the Republican position--even including Social Security
   cuts in his budget proposal.

   If I had to bet, I'd say Republicans are bluffing, but even if they
   aren't, Democrats need to stick to their no-negotiations pledge on the
   debt limit. What we've seen with the sequester is that negotiating with
   saboteurs doesn't stop them from doing harm. At best, it just delays
   the inevitable. It also lets them avoid the blame for the crisis they
   created.

   It's hard to be confident that Democrats will do the right thing here,
   especially given the White House budget proposal. But if they do, one
   of two things will happen: Either Republicans will cave, or they will
   force the nation into default. Nobody wants default, but if the
   alternative to default is setting the precedent that Republicans can
   use the debt limit every year or two to force things like the sequester
   and Social Security benefit cuts down the country's throat (while
   blaming Democrats!), then default is looking more and more like the
   lesser of two evils.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   The politics of these high-wire acts over the past two years are
   horrible for them.  Whether you like the President's politicking or

   It is time to end the charade. Nowhere in the constitution does it say

 Actually, it does ([180]0+ / 0-)
       Article 1, Sections 7 and 8.
       Congress intentionally underfunds the budget, knowing full well
       that the President is required to spend money he doesn't have.
       Two "easy" solutions:
       1. A constitutional amendment requiring Congress to fully fund its
       budget
       2. A constitutional amendment allowing the president to choose
       which parts of the budget to not fund when congress short-changes
       the country
       Personally, I'd like to see the Pentultimate Poison Pill:
       3. If the fully funded budget is not submitted to the president by
       March 31st, a special election will be held to replace the entire
       congress; members occupying office within the last 6 years are
       ineligible to run. Also, appropriations bills may not be larger
       than 1% of the current budget.

   WE are the ones bluffing, as always.

   It's amusing to see this:

     If I had to bet, I'd say Republicans are bluffing, but even if they
     aren't, Democrats need to stick to their no-negotiations pledge on
     the debt limit.

   right next to this:

     President Obama has already gone more than halfway towards the
     Republican position--even including Social Security cuts in his
     budget proposal.

   We have ALREADY negotiated, or surrendered, or caved, or whatever we
   want to call it.

   And the goppers have every reason to believe (and utterly no reason NOT
   to believe) that we will indeed repeat history for the umpteenth time
   and surrender once again to the hostage-taking.

 It's high time Obama and his allies put ([262]0+ / 0-)

   forward the steps already taken to reduce the deficit - the deficit has
   been falling for  a few years and, at least in the short-term, is not

   economics.

   The most violent element in society is ignorance.
