   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Brown allegedly refused to give another driver his license,
       insurance info after a wreck
     * The other driver told police Brown screamed and cursed at her after
       the minor crash
     * Brown remains free until another hearing on August 16
     * The singer faces another probation violation for allegedly failing
       to complete community service

   Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown faces possible jail time after a judge
   revoked his probation Monday in connection with his conviction in the
   beating of his girlfriend Rihanna.

   Brown's alleged failure to hand over his drivers license and insurance
   information to another driver after a minor traffic crash in May
   triggered the probation revocation, but the singer will remain free
   until a trial is held.

   Brown, 24, was already facing a probation violation trial after
   prosecutors accused him of not completing the community labor ordered
   for his 2009 felony assault conviction.

   A representative for Brown, however, said the singer expects the
   traffic charges to be dropped and probation reinstated.

   A lawyer for the other driver said in a court hearing Monday morning
   "that his client did not want to press charges, that any damage was
   "negligible" and that Chris did identify himself at the scene and that
   she was given all of the appropriate insurance information," the Brown
   rep said in a statement to CNN Monday evening.

   "We are hopeful that the case will be dismissed next week," the rep
   said.

   A woman whose Mercedes was allegedly rear-ended by a Range Rover that
   Brown was driving on a Los Angeles street told investigators that he
   "went ballistic" after the traffic accident and screamed at her.

   Chris Brown's biggest regret
   Did Adele yell at Chris Brown?
   Is there a pop star double standard?

   According to the police report on the incident, the other driver, Olga
   Gure, quoted Brown as shouting at her: "You are a b---h!"

   [48]Brown charged with hit-and-run

   The report added more from Gure, who quoted Brown as saying, "Who do
   you think you are, b---h? Do you think if you driving Mercedes so got
   money, b---h? Do you think I am just a black n----r? I got more money
   than you, beech!"

   The trigger for Brown's alleged rage was that Gure took a photo of him
   and his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, to document the scene -- since he
   allegedly refused to show her his driver's license, she said.

   When Brown tried to grab the camera, Tran screamed "Don't touch her,
   don't touch her," Gure said.

   "I was so shocked, that I was speechless," she said. "Just a moment ago
   he was a nice guy. After screaming some insulting nonsense for a while
   longer, he slammed a door and drove away fast and noisy."

   A private investigator visited her two days later to give her Brown's
   name, birthdate and business address and the contact information for
   Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, she said. She was also given an expired
   insurance card for the Range Rover, she said.

   A body shop estimate showed Gure's car needed $868 in bumper repairs.

   Brown was ordered to return to court on August 16 for a hearing to set
   a trial date to determine if the probation revocation will stand. If it
   does, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin could
   order Brown to jail to serve part of the original five-year jail
   sentence imposed for the attack on Rihanna.

   Another judge continued the traffic case against Brown during a hearing
   Monday morning. He is charged with hit-and-run driving and driving
   without a license.

   The ever divisive Chris Brown

   Brown's Twitter defense

   Brown used his Twitter account to protest the traffic charges last
   month:

   "It's not a hit and run if u get out the car, exchange information (who
   has NO DAMAGE to either cars).This is really ridiculous"

   "I have a valid drivers license and I gave the woman the right info.
   She saw cameras and wanted to make a scene."

   "She contacted the cops thinking of a payday from Chris Brown when I
   followed the proper procedures."

   "My lawyers will be contacting you. I will not stand for this bullying
   and yellow journalism!"

   "My profile pic is the pic I took of the persons car after "the hit and
   run". NO damage. Just a dirty car. once again, I gotta clear my name"

   "I work my ass off to provide for my entire family. I've made mistakes
   in the past and have worked hard to be a better person. "

   "19-24 years of age. I don't have all the answers and you can't show me
   a person that age who has it figured out. We live and grow. Let me
   live"

   Another probation violation charge

   Brown punched Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood
   street, leaving her face bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy
   Awards in February 2009.

   He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve
   five years probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in
   "labor-oriented service" for the assault conviction. The judge allowed
   him to serve the sentence in Richmond, Virginia, under the direct
   supervision of the police chief.

   In a court filing in February 2013, prosecutors accused Brown of not
   completing the community labor. The paperwork Brown submitted to show
   he had completed community labor is "at best sloppy documentation and
   at worst fraudulent reporting," District Attorney Jackie Lacey said.
   Brown wasn't in town on some of the dates reported, the motion said.

   Geragos, Brown's attorney, said the prosecutor's filing was so
   fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district
   attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing
   false documents with the court.

   "And I don't mean just false, it is fraudulent," Geragos said.

   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has "tortured" Brown
   during his probation more than any client he's ever had, Geragos said.

   The prosecutor is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400
   hours of community service under the supervision of a Los Angeles
   probation officer.
