   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Fergie and Josh Duhamel have welcomed a son
     * The singer gave birth on Thursday; the couple named the baby Axl
       Jack
     * Duhamel: Axl Jack is "a name that we both really love"

   (CNN) -- Don't be surprised if Fergie is singing "[51]Sweet Child O'
   Mine" today.

   The Black Eyed Peas star gave birth to a boy in Los Angeles on
   Thursday, a rep confirms to CNN. She and her husband, actor Josh
   Duhamel, named their new addition Axl Jack.

   Little Axl weighed in at 7 pounds and 10 ounces and was delivered via
   C-section. He is the first child for both parents. "Everyone is fine,
   everything is well. All good in Hollywood," the rep tells CNN.

   Growing their family is "something that we've wanted for a very long
   time," Duhamel, 40, [52]told E! in May. "We're both over the moon about
   it."

   As far as the name, it sounds as if Axl was indeed inspired by rock,
   and perhaps Guns N' Roses front man Axl Rose.

   "[The name is] kind of traditional, kind of not," Duhamel explained to
   [53]People magazine, noting that his 38-year-old wife "is a little rock
   and roll, so she's a little bit more daring in that department than I
   am."

   Nevertheless, Axl Jack is "a name that we both really love, and I think
   will suit this child."

   Although Axl is the couple's first human child, the newborn does have a
   furry sibling waiting for him to come home. The pair's dog, Zoe,
   [54]has already been prepped by the Dog Whisperer himself, Cesar
   Millan, for the baby's homecoming.
