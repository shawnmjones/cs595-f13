[24]CPAC 2013: Wayne LaPierre and Bachmann want to spend your money

   Yes, I am still here at CPAC. And yes, I am beginning to believe this
   is primarily because my editors secretly hate me.

   If young conservatives represent the dominant faction here, the tea
   party is a close second. That, perhaps, explains the enthusiastic
   reception to Wayne LaPierre, the far-right, all-guns, all-the-time
   spokesman for the National Rifle Association. And he gets a fine
   reception: I am sitting next to an older couple, clearly tea partiers
   themselves, and they chatter excitedly to each other as LaPierre makes
   his stump-speech points. The only reason for keeping a government list
   of who has guns is so that government can tax them, or take them,
   LaPierre says. "That's it, they jut want to take them away" the woman
   says to her husband. "The one thing a violent rapist deserves to face
   is a good woman with a gun!" he says, a line that garners perhaps the
   loudest and longest applause. To LaPierre and the crowd, putting armed
   officers in schools is an obvious good--the same crowd has spent an
   entire conference grumbling about government spending, though, and no
   mention of funding such a plan gets made. He is convinced that police
   are not getting gun-toting criminals off the streets because they are
   lazy or undevoted to the cause; that gun ownership should be made
   freer, though, and left unregulated, and left anonymous, is not even
   open to question.

   LaPierre is, as most of the far-far-right, convinced that "elitists"
   are the problem. On the "elitists" who are against them, he says
   loudly: "Let them be damned!"

   I have just come from hearing Michele Bachmann talk. She is loud, and
   very animated, and so relentless in her off the cuff speech (mostly
   about her children that there simply is no room for applause lines. One
   of her big points is that we could cure Alzheimer's, experts say, in
   ten years. It currently costs $170 billion to fight; in the future, she
   says, it will cost up to $20 trillion. "Why wouldn't you do this", she
   says of a cure, citing the vast savings of money and life that came
   from the polio vaccine not all that long ago. "Enough of this false
   compassion!" from liberals, who apparently do not think of things like
   these. She says that we could all fund our cars with 23 cents a gallon
   natural gas, according to the natural gas group she has just met with,
   but all other policy mentions in her speech both before and after are
   of cutting taxes, the obvious outrage involved in "taking away money
   from you that you need!!"

   Again, if there is any funding to be had for fighting Alzheimer's, it
   is left entirely unsaid. And this also sounds more than a little like
   science, and not just science, but medical research in particular, and
   Rand Paul was just telling us yesterday about meth and monkeys and why
   medical research into these things was just a grade-A grift from those
   wacky scientists.

   I have a very, very bad headache at this point.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [42]Tagging tips - [43]Search For Tags - [44]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     LaPierre is, as most of the far-far-right, convinced that "elitists"
     are the problem. On the "elitists" who are against them, he says
     loudly: "Let them be damned!"

   I read posts that echo LaPierre's "far-far-right" paranoid

       You know, the things bad girls get when they are not having
       biblically acceptable sex within the confines of their church
       certified wedding to a member of the opposite sex. So, if this is a
       vaccine to protect against cervical cancer it will KILL YOU DEAD.
       Protecting against Alzheimers with a different vaccine is perfectly
       good as long as it costs a lot and the pharmaceutical company gets
       super rich off of it. Your gold plated insurance pays for it and
       everyone else just gets sick.
       This is the good kind of science that her pastor tells her about in

   Talk about a very inexpensive and fun solution to part of the

       In breast cancer, we're making them focus on two things -
       development of a preventive vaccine and finding a way to stop
       metastasis.
       Put the money on those goals until its done, period.

 This illustrates what I am talking about ([506]0+ / 0-)

     I've been involved in research advocacy for over a decade.
       but neither goal has been realized, right?
       And that is because there is no underlying scientific foundation to
       reach those goals.
       For example, no one really understands metastasis well enough to
       design treatments to stop it.  Hence the need for open ended,
       curiosity driven research to try to figure that out.
       That model worked spectacularly for several decades after WW2 and
       there is no reason to abandon it now.

 Read the link for Artemis Project ([528]0+ / 0-)
       and follow the links contained therein.  There is a scientific

       narrowing down the possible paths to follow.
       There's also funding that has been granted for these pilot
       projects. There are quite a few scientists already collaborating on
       the project.  We also helped create the DoD BCRP which is another
       source of focused funding.
       The next startup will be the plan for studying metastasis. It's

   No room to think about how putting armed guard in every school might
   impact a budget.

   No room to think about how cutting scientific budgets (who can
   understand that stuff anyway) might impact medical research.

   No room to consider that cutting the federal budget means cutting jobs.
   And cutting jobs means those people aren't spending money anymore. And
   their not spending money means the economy as a whole slows down. And a
   slower economy means lower tax revenue which means even more borrowing
   to cover the revenue we don't have.  Besides, that's all just that
   number stuff that the liberals use to try to confuse you.

   No room to think about how reducing government spending means programs
   will get cut.

   Ask a Republican to name something that should have its budget cut and
   you'll most likely get the answer of "that wasteful stuff". Which
   "wasteful stuff"? They're not really sure but they're positive that
   there's "wasteful stuff" to cut that won't impact them.

   It seems to me that the GOP are the ones who are keeping families on

   welfare is not backed up at all.  The GOP are the real promoters of
   poverty by keeping workers poor and more families having to go on

   Worse, even good guys with guns sometimes lose them, or discharge them

   well, she has not been in the US on her position as Bureau Chief of the
   Washingtoner studio for German TV more  than 9 month and hasn't tasted
   the American conservatives for very long yet.

   But today she came back and was ... very animated, shocked and
   fascinated ... she didn't want to be judgemental, but it was all ...
   very interesting to learn...

   Especially to learn about all the hate that these speakers and the
   young conservative "guns" spew out.

   Al of it, she said, she knew before, in theory and from reading, but
   seeing, feeling and listening live to the propaganda, being physical on
   location is something that makes the "theoretical knowledge" an
   under-the-skin-kind of experience that sticks with you for life.

   She was especially "impressed" about the young "conservative" female
   women, with high stiletto heels and super mini skirts (clearly a
   religiously conservative method of making conservatism sexy)... as well
   as the bookstore that had books stocked about the German Lutheran
   theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was a dissident anti-Nazi and
   founding member of the Confessing Church.

   These US conservatives on CPAC have the audacity to "make Bonhoeffer
   one of their own heros" and - quite frankly - nothing could be more
   insulting to any German than that.

   The CPAC propaganda agenda is so twisted and mind manipulating to the
   younger US generation that it scares the heck out of many of us.

   They never fail to sell their libertarianism and defense of freedom
   theme as anti-dictatorial, anti-tyranical and anti-faschistic, putting
   them on the high pedestal of morality in comparison to the evil Nazi
   Germans, whose hidden faschist tendencies must be fought with vigor
   (and of course their guns) ...  and people believe in that f'n shit.

   When our bureau chief asked a couple of the "conservative" young people
   who staffed the stands at the bookstore, NONE of them knew WHO
   Bonhoeffer was.

   But they knew like trained little pit-bulls to spew out hate
   expressions on request, perfectly learned by heart, trained by the
   propaganda machinery of the conservative movement.

   I kind of regret that so much has been written about CPAC. We had a
   watercooler kind of chat in the studio, if these people, who are so
   enthusiastically supporting the CPAC propaganda, represent the
   Republicans in the US as a whole being half of the US population. Many
   of us still think that is the case.

   OK, I am still trying to see if we have HUNTER on our videos .... but I
   guess he needed to go to the bathroom more than once to throw up. Poor
   guy. He should get hazardous duty pay like our underpaid combat
   soldiers, who still get a fraction of what any "contract hired gun
   soldier" or "US mainstream media reporter" gets covering this stuff.

 I am genuinely concerned about Hunter's well being ([850]1+ / 0-)

   Was any kind of plan put in place for extracting him quickly in an
   emergency, or was it assumed he'd try to use that plan the second he
   walked in the door so it was nixed as a way to keep him there for the
   long haul??

 Where is Mitt amid all this CPAC frivolity? ([857]0+ / 0-)

 I hesitantly recommend this diary. ([860]0+ / 0-)

   It contains quotes from Michelle Bachmann, after all.

   It's sooooo weird. Her statement about Alzheimer's is absolutely on
   point. Substitute any major disease for Alzheimer's in that sentence
   and it would still work: AIDS, Cancer, Autism, etc.

   Jim Graves should point this out in a debate, if he runs against her
   again (and he should). It would make her look like a liberal. He would
   score enough points to shove her out of Congress.

   Now my head hurts.

 I recommend Scotch for your headache. ([863]0+ / 0-)

   Pharmaceuticals won't help in this case. You need a proper
   mood-altering drug.
