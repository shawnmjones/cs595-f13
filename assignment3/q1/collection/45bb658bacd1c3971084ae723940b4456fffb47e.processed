'Hoping for a miracle': Will Cleveland probe find 4th missing girl?

   By Michael Martinez, CNN
   updated 6:49 PM EDT, Wed May 8, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Police questioning of brothers yields no leads in Summers'
       disappearance
     * Ashley Summers was just like two of three women held in captivity
       for a decade
     * She and the two women went missing as teens within five blocks of
       each other
     * Summers family is "hoping for a miracle" that the investigation
       will yield clues

   (CNN) -- The[41] discovery of three young women missing for a decade in
   Cleveland immediately raised the hopes of the family of a fourth
   missing woman.

   After all, Ashley Summers was just like two of the three discovered
   women: Cleveland teenagers who all disappeared within five blocks of
   each other over a four-year span.

   The anticipation for Summers' family was heightened momentarily when
   authorities said they had yet to identify one of the three discovered
   women.

   Was it Ashley? Could it be Ashley, who went missing almost six years
   ago at age 14?

   "At first, when they said the third girl wasn't identified, I was
   hoping one would be Ashley," said her aunt, Debra Summers.

   Ashley Summers' mother expressed similar emotions. "She said, 'Oh, my
   God' -- just hoping it was Ashley," Debra Summers, 30, said of her
   sister Jennifer Summers, 33, who wasn't immediately available for
   interviews Tuesday.

   But the third woman held in captivity for a decade was someone else,
   not Ashley, authorities announced.

   "I was upset, but I was happy at the same time that they found the
   third girl," Debra Summers said.
   Emotional ride for Summers family
   Three separate cases, one rescue

   Now the Summers family is hoping that the investigation into the[42]
   three women's decade-long captivity will yield information about
   Ashley, who disappeared on July 6, 2007.

   "We're hoping that it's connected, and they knew where she was,"
   Summers said of the investigation. "We're hoping for a miracle."

   Investigators questioned three brothers about Summers, but police said
   Wednesday they had no new leads. Only one brother, Ariel Castro, will
   be charged in the kidnappings, police said.

   "There is no new information that's come to light about her: Ashley
   Summers is an active, open investigation," Cleveland Police Deputy
   Chief Ed Tomba told reporters Wednesday. "I can assure you that her
   disappearance was part of our questioning of the three subjects that we
   brought in."

   Investigators will speak to the three discovered women to see if they
   know anything about Summers' disappearance, said Special Agent Vicki
   Anderson, of the FBI Cleveland Division.

   The discovery of the three women might prompt someone who has
   information -- but never said anything -- to call authorities, she
   said.

   "We're really very dependent on the public's assistance on things such
   as this, for them to be aware of people around them, to report things
   that are suspicious, to take a look at the pictures of these
   individuals who are missing and see if they recognize them," Anderson
   said.

   Since Ashley Summers disappeared, "there's been no legitimate
   sightings, no accessing social media, anything," Anderson said.

   Former FBI agent Jennifer Eakin said authorities have long believed in
   a link in the disappearances of Summers and two of the women discovered
   this week -- Amanda Berry and Georgina "Gina" DeJesus. Eakin is now a
   case manager at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children,
   which in 2008 held a comprehensive review of the cases with the FBI and
   Cleveland police.

   "We did in fact believe there was an association between the Berry case
   and the DeJjesus case as well as the Summers case," Eakin said.

   [43]In 2009, CNN reported how the FBI was investigating connections
   between the three missing Cleveland teens. "We kind of put all three of
   these cases together to work them to see if there's any connection,"
   FBI Special Agent Scott Wilson, in the agency's Cleveland Division,
   said then.

   At the time, authorities said Ashley Summers was initially reported as
   a runaway after a family argument. Problem was, she never contacted her
   family again, authorities said.

   "She's considered an endangered juvenile who may have been a runaway
   and possibly abducted," Anderson said.

   The Summers family is also renewing their efforts to publicize Ashley's
   disappearance. The FBI's missing person website says Ashley Summers has
   a tattoo of "Gene" enclosed in a heart on her upper arm, and her
   birthday is June 16, 1993, making her 19 years old.

   Jennifer Summers, a restaurant cook, has seven other children, whose
   ages range from 2 to 16, and Ashley is her oldest, said Debra Summers,
   a shipping clerk who lives in Parma, Ohio.

   Debra Summers last saw her niece two weeks before she disappeared.

   "She just hanged around the house and talked about her boyfriend and
   the usual stuff," Debra Summers said. "She actually wanted to move in
   with me, and I said yeah, but she never came."

   Ashley Summers left her mother's home, where four younger siblings were
   then also living, and instead moved to her great-uncle's residence, so
   she could be closer to friends, Debra Summers said.

   Then she vanished.
