My TED Talk: Giving Teachers What They Deserve

   IFRAME: [13]http://embed.ted.com/talks/1739.html

   I spend a lot of my time working to help improve America's schools. I'm
   also a big fan of TED talks. So when TED's Chris Anderson asked me to
   give a talk as part of a special TED session on education, I jumped at
   the chance. You can watch my talk above, and you can [14]go here to
   find out when the whole show will air in your area.
   John Legend hosted the show and did a fantastic job. John cares a lot
   about improving education and is investing a lot of his own time on the
   issue. I first met him when we were both involved with the documentary
   Waiting for Superman, and I could tell right away that he was an
   impressive and well informed guy, in addition to being a super-talented
   musician. It's great that he's using his fame to draw attention to the
   need to improve our schools.

   We taped the TED show last month in a beautiful hall at the Brooklyn
   Academy of Music in New York City. I was very impressed with the lineup
   of speakers. One of the great things about the TED format is that it
   can accommodate lots of different kinds of speakers, from energetic
   storytellers to more analytical people like me who are hardcore about
   numbers and systems. That helps the audience look at the topic from
   lots of different angles.

   In this case, they had education experts like Geoffrey Canada, who runs
   a terrific program called the Harlem Children's Zone, and Dr. Angela
   Lee Duckworth, whom I've met with a few times as part of my own
   learning about education. They also had several passionate teachers
   from around the country. One of them, a chemistry teacher named Ramsey
   Musallam, startled everyone with video of himself blowing stuff up in
   class. John brought the house down with a beautiful cover of "True
   Colors."

   For my part, I talked about what I think is the most powerful idea in
   education today: getting teachers the feedback they deserve so they can
   improve their practice.

   It's amazing to think about how much coaching is given to, say,
   professional athletes. I have a coach who gives me feedback too.
   (You'll have to watch the show if you want to know why.) But most
   teachers get almost no feedback at all. And the vast majority of
   countries that outperform us in education have some formal way to give
   their teachers feedback. So this is an area where innovation and
   investment can make a big difference for teachers and students in this
   country.

   As always, the TED team put together a great show, and I'm happy to
   have been a part of it.
   In the meantime, here's a short video where I talk about what drives
   the foundation's education work. The statistics on how U.S. schools
   rank internationally are really mind-blowing. In this video, I'm
   rehearsing a presentation about some of the most striking numbers.

Who's Beating the U.S. in Education?

   Other countries are leap-frogging the U.S. on global measures of
   student skills and knowledge. Here's a look at some of the data.
