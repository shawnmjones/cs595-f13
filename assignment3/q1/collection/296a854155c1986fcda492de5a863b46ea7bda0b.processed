   Anthony Swift at the Natural Resources Defense Blog writes [29]Exxon's
   Arkansas Tar Sands Spill: The Tar Sands Name Game:

     As the American public becomes acquainted with images of tar sands
   flowing across lawns, driveways and streets of an Arkansas suburb near
    Little Rock (for video of the spill go [30]here), Exxon is now making
     the claim that the crude spilled from its ruptured Pegasus pipeline
    isn't technically tar sands. This attempt is reminiscent of the knots
   that Enbridge tied itself denying that the million gallons of tar sands
   it spilled into the Kalamazoo River weren't actually tar sands. During
    that spill Kari Kydersen, a former Washington Post reporter covering
   the spill for OnEarth Magazine, helped break Enbridge CEO's about-face,
     when after denying that his company had spilled `tar sands" for two
                           weeks, told the press:

     "No, I haven't said it's not tar sand oil. What I indicated is that
     it was not what we have traditionally referred to as tar sands oil.
     ... If it is part of the same geological formation, then I bow to
     that expert opinion. I'm not saying, `No, it's not oil sands crude.'
     It's just not traditionally defined as that and viewed as that."
     Enbridge CEO Patrick Daniel, August 12th, 2010

   Alberta and Saskatchewan

    My colleague Josh Mogerman wrote in detail about Enbridge's denial --
   and it seems that Exxon is borrowing Enbridge's playbook in this case.
      Exxon has identified the crude spilled in Mayflower, Arkansas as
   Wabasca Heavy diluted bitumen. Now the company is making the case that
    the crude it spilled is not technically `tar sands.' However, Exxon's
     argument doesn't stand close scrutiny. Let's look at the key facts:

   1. Wabasca Heavy diluted bitumen is produced in Alberta's Athabasca tar
                             sands region. [...]

        2. Wabasca Heavy Diluted Bitumen is considered by the Alberta
                       Government as tar sands. [...]

   3. Industry considers Wabasca Heavy diluted bitumen as tar sands.[...]

     How does Exxon argue Wabasca heavy is not in fact tar sands? Their
    argument seems to be based entirely on how Wabasca heavy is produced.
    Tar sands near the surface is essentially strip mined. When it isn't
   nearly the surface, most companies heat water and flood the underground
     tar sands formations with steam in order to reduce the viscosity of
   (i.e. melt) the bitumen so it can be recovered from wells in a process
               called Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD).

     Exxon makes the point that Wabasca Heavy bitumen isn't produced by
   either mining or SAGD, but a process called Solvent Assisted Production
                                (SAP). [...]

   And if you use water and polymer solvents instead of steam, rather than
     producing tar sands bitumen you get [DEL: tar sands :DEL] bitumen.
            _____________________________________________________

   [31]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2012--Mitt Romney
   once believed the answer to higher gasoline prices was more
   fuel-efficient cars:

   Keeping track of Mitt Romney1 versus Mitt Romney2 is reaching the point
         where we need a distributed computing project running 24/7.
    The latest Romney incarnation has been taking President Obama to task
   for his energy policies, using rising gasoline prices as the cudgel and
     promoting drillbabydrill as the solution, all the while saying the
    president is a backer of higher prices. He's pointed, for example, to
     an interview in 2008 with John Harwood of CNBC in which Obama said:

     "The only way we're going to deal with these high gas prices is if
     we change how we consume oil and that means investing in alternative
     fuels. It means that we are raising fuel efficiency standards on
     cars; that we're helping the automakers retool."

     Quite right as far as it went. [...] Efficiency, alternatives like
    electric vehicles and more reliance on upgraded mass transit are not
                 just going to be options, but necessities.
   And guess what? Mitt Romney1 was saying the same thing back in May 2006
    when he was governor of Massachusetts and told the Patriot Ledger he
    opposed a suspension of the gasoline tax, saying the better approach
               would be to build more fuel-efficient vehicles.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [60]Civil
   Rights, [61]Community, [62]Congress, [63]Culture, [64]Economy,
   [65]Education, [66]Elections, [67]Energy, [68]Environment, [69]Health
   Care, [70]International, [71]Labor, [72]Law, [73]Media, [74]Meta,
   [75]National Security, [76]Science, [77]Transportation, or [78]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([79]California, [80]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     [113]Lawmaker Links Gun Control to Bestiality
     Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) linked his opposition to any gun control
     legislation to gay marriage and bestiality on a conference call, a
     recording of which was obtained by Right Wing Watch.
     Said Gohmert: "In fact, I had this discussion with some wonderful,
     caring Democrats earlier this week on the issue of, well, they said
     "surely you could agree to limit the number of rounds in a magazine,
     couldn't you? How would that be problematic?"
     "And I pointed out, well, once you make it ten, then why would you
     draw the line at ten? What's wrong with nine? Or eleven? And the
     problem is once you draw that limit ; it's kind of like marriage
     when you say it's not a man and a woman any more, then why not have
     three men and one woman, or four women and one man, or why not
     somebody has a love for an animal?"
       Where does Gohmert fit in Texas politics?  A reader [114]offered
       this comment about an hour ago on Political Wire

     Siegfried Heydrich o an hour ago

     Surprise, surprise, surprise! That's our Gomer... Seriously, what
     the hell is it with Texas that they keep electing loons?  I mean, I
     expect Republicans in general to be a burrito short of a combo
     platter, but the Texans seem to all bean and no beef.  Seriously, I
     can't understand why somebody hasn't taken him aside and let him
     know that he's really making Texas a laughing stock... Between him
     and Cruz, they've pretty much nailed down the bottom of the curve in
     both the House and Senate.

   flooded with new users.  I'm pretty sure almost all of these new users
   are spammers or bots.  While the rate had been getting faster, it seems
   they suddenly started slowing down right when Hurricane Sandy hit.  It
   slowed down to under 1,000 new users in a 24-hour period, and we were
   back down to somewhat over 100 new users every 24 hours or so, until
   about January 30th, when it exploded again.  What are they
   [286]planning?

   And for your Diary Rescue music pleasure, here's Taryn Southern's "Keep
   It in Your Pants".  Yes, the song is most definitely NSFW.

       is if Ezra Klein guest hosts Hardball, and has a segment with the
       strategists on, with Karen Finney for the Dems and Todd Harris for
       the GOP, about what Obama is doing.  Then a segment where he talks
       with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) about some legislation in
       Congress.  Then have a segment with NFL players Brendan Ayenbadejo
       and Chris Kluwe being such strong supporters of marriage equality,
       and on whether the NFL is ready for an openly gay player.  Then
       maybe a segment with the Center for American Progress's Neera

   And they'd have kittens over her hosting her own show too.

   I think what bothers Mr Graham so much is not MSNBC's "touting" but
   that they gave that job to someone who is highly accomplished,
   articulate, passionate, outspoken, smart, female AND black.

   Girls and blacks aren't allowed to be anything but cheerleaders, fluff
   heads or tokens in the contemporary GOP/Fox News reality.

   The hue of Finney's skin isn't the issue. It's what sits between her
   ears and now the prominent platform from which she speaks that drives
   him nuts.

       Much needs to be made of this Exxon spill, to educate the public.

       home).
       Tonight, he had been speaking to a client, so I had the TV on. He
       stepped into the room, sat down, said nothing, and watched
       intently. At one point he said, "wow, he's hammering that guy."
       Then he watched again in silence.
       At the end, he just looked at me and had a few choice words for the
       elected representative who sold his soul and his country  for a few
       bucks to the gun lobby.
       And he wants to know who names their kid "Asa."
       I think we political junkies often underestimate the effect smart
       folks like ODonnell have when they focus laser like on the truth.

   The Athabasca tar sands seems to be a total mystery to most people -
   and You have at least brought SOME illumination

   If You look at that map - You get a rough estimate of 1700 billion
   barrels compared to the Saudi Arabia reserve estimate of 267 billion
   barrels -

   That is 6 times the size of the Saudi Arabian reserves - and if we
   reflect on just how far we have fucked ourselves over Middle East oil,
   we will BEGIN to understand the challenges of avoiding fucking
   ourselves over Alberta oil!

       was 'recoverable' - despite them knowing that it was there and
       recoverable if the price increased to the point of profitability
       the pipeline has been in the works for decades, and it has been

       So yeah, in theory, new technologies could be developed.  If the
       price of crude oil were $500 /bbl or something like that.
       But seriously, if alternate energy has not become WAY cheaper in
       the 20 or 30 years before that happens the planet is totally fucked
       well beyond anything the tar sands may or may not contribute.

       for transporting the bitumen, so it's probably for the best that

       . . .
       the first better is for safety - there will be many more spills but
       they will each be smaller - I * think * that is better.
       the second better is employment-wise - it takes more people to run
       a railroad than a pipeline.
       and the third better is that this means the considerable profits
       will shift away from bad billionaires like the Koch Brothers to

   Peaceful town of about 1,600 people.  When the news reports a pipeline
   ruptured under a residential neighborhood in Mayflower, AR.  They
   should say "the " residential neighborhood.

   Most residents of Mayflower were unaware they lived above an oil
   pipeline.

   The 65 year-old Exxon Pegasus pipeline that ruptured carries crude from
   the Canadian tar sands to Texas and is only one-tenth the size of the
   proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which, when it ruptures, as all pipeline
   eventually do, the spill will be 10 TIMES GREATER.

   Adjacent to Mayflower is [864]Lake Conway, 6,700 acres of bass and
   crappie fishing.

   There is serious concern the oil spill will contaminate Lake Conway.

   Still no comment from our US Congressman, [865]Tim "Voter Caging"
   Griffin (R-AR2d), who has been pushing for the Keystone pipeline.

 3 Reasons I Would NEVER Comment On Those Sites ([890]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [891]JeffW

       1) The gun running the site is often a loony Sys Admin and he can
       probably figure out who you are if you piss him off enough.  I
       don't need a crazed militia stalker.
       2) I was trolliing a site like that when I got hit by malware.  Was
       it a cyberattack?  I think so.
       3) Posting a comment is probably going to get someone marked as a
       potential terrorist regardless of the content.

 Asa Hutchinson to Run for Governor of AR in 2014.. ([895]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [896]bigjacbigjacbigjac, [897]JeffW

   ASA becomes spokesperson for NRA to get face-time in the national media
   as he may have plans to try to get back to elected office in Arkansas.
    He'll AGAIN try for the Governorship.

   Last attempt was a failure as Republican nominee for Governor in 2006.
    He got beat by our current Democratic Governor Mike Beebe.

   Beebe won the state constitutional offices back to the Democrats
   following the reign of Reverend Governor Mike Huckabee.

   Currently the legislature is under the control of Republicans, mostly
   of the Tea Party variety. First time they have had such control since
   Reconstruction.

   Democratic Party was weakened following the fatal shooting of the Chair
   of the Democratic Party, [898]Bill Gwatney, who was shot three times in
   2008 while working at Democratic Headquarters.

   Following that event, even though Beebe got reelected, the legislature
   gradually fell to the control of the Republicans.

   ASA hasn't declared his intention yet, but it's classic for Republicans
   to run losers because they have name recognition.  He's top of the
   short list of possibles.

   They just hope the electorate has forgotten why they remember his name.

   it deals with the expense of
   extracting oil from tar sands.

   If the expense,
   when the expense,
   of getting oil out of the ground
   gets too great,
   the Government will bail out the oil companies.

   They will have to.

   But I'm predicting the demise of modern civilization,
   eventually,
   caused by a shortage of oil.

   I don't have a huge amount of research in it,
   but I point out that without enough oil,
   specifically,
   without enough diesel fuel,
   we don't have enough food.

   Come and give it a read,
   and write a little comment.

   Or a long comment.

   I'm an attention whore,
   so I look back at every diary,
   for days,
   checking for new comments.

   Certainly the people whose property was damanged don't much care where

   there is a good news/bad news side if it is tar sands from Canada --

   Gee -- how did it get all the way down there, why does anybody need
   Keystone, and

   What's the point of getting worked up over Keystone when they can get
   the stuff whereever they want it to go?

   Of course, it does reinforce what I've said all along -- It's
   hypocritical to focus on Keystone instead of the fact that we burn a
   lot of tar sand oil

   Thanks.

   The propaganda machine at work.  Did you see the guy on Chris Hayes
   show last night?  A left-wing poser who doesn't want the XL pipeline to
   go through, but conveniently interjects points that favor Big Oil, or
   soften the argument against the whole thing.  Fair and balanced, I
   guess.  The interesting thing is not that Big Oil might have an
   apologist on a cable news show.  The interesting thing is that he
   claimed to be against the pipeline.  Seriously, do they think we were
   born yesterday?

 Thanks for the kind words... ([937]0+ / 0-)
       ...I didn't see the guy on Chris Hayes. I know the type.
       I do, however, think we should always be cautious about one thing:
       We should address the weaknesses in our own arguments and not
       ignore the strengths of those whom we oppose. I know from
       experience that some people think that this approach hurts us. I
       disagree. Not acknowledging those weaknesses and strengths is what
       hurts us.
       For instance, when Exxon or any of the fossil fuel giants argue
       that oil (or coal or natural gas) production is all about demand
       for their product, we need to admit that, ultimately, this is true,
       and we therefore must reduce that demand both by reducing our usage
       and by supporting efforts to change our sources of energy.
       Where we should attack is when they lie about their accidents, when
       they work to block a switch to those other sources of energy and
       when they try to get new or keep old special favors for their
       continued exploitation of fossil fuel sources ... and of us. Of
       course, they do those things every day.

       you what you believe.

 It's tar sand OIL ([941]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [942]JeffW

   While we're on the subject of grammar, it would be nice if DK would
   strive for accuracy itself. Tar sands are the stuff that gets mined to
   produce petroleum - they don't actually pump that oily grit through a
   pipeline. In fact, they can't, not unless they were to drastically
   dilute it and heat it up enogh to make it into a liquid solution.

   What they're pumping is the petroleum extracted from tar sands - which
   is pretty nasty stuff, no doubt about it, and the production of which
   is an environmental nightmare. But please quit writing about it as if
   they were actually trying to pump sand through a pipeline. It's not
   hard to write an extra three letters each time you refer to it by name
   - tar sands oil.

 What's in a name? Tar sands vs oil sands ([945]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [946]JeffW, [947]Wisewood

   On CBC Radio yesterday, Thomas Homer-Dixon said that NYT changed all
   his "oil sands" references to "tar sands" in accordance with their
   style. In Canada, the Harper Conservatives have decreed that only "oil
   sands" is to be used with the result that anyone who uses "tar sands"
   is considered a radical environmentalist and an unpatriotic Canadian.

   It's a diversionary tactic - the same Conservative government is 100%
   in the climate change denier camp, being the only country to withdraw
   from the Kyoto Treaty. Government scientists are not permitted to talk
   to any media outlet unless it has been pre-cleared by Harper's office
   (clearances are never given and scientists are completely muzzled). The
   pro-tar sands propaganda funded by both federal and Alberta governments
   and the oil and pipeline companies is relentless on TV and radio and in
   print.

   Despite this, most Canadians know that the tar sands are hugely
   polluting the air and water and releasing huge quantities of CO2. The
   pipeline spills in Canada and the U.S. are a feature, definitely not a
   bug!

 The geologic formation... ([950]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [951]JeffW

       ... which bitumen is mined from was called the Athabasca Tar Sands
       for many years.
       But the "oil sands" euphemism actually originated with the group of
       companies first exploiting the resource, and then was adopted by
       the Alberta provincial government.  "Oil sands" apparently sounds
       cleaner - and, I'd guess, more commercially viable - than the "tar
       sands" name.
       But that was all some time before Harper was on the scene, maybe
       the late 1990s... and some time before the effects of bitumen
       mining in Athabasca became widely known.
       It's become so that the name you use to describe the formation -
       and their commercial exploitation - is usually indicative of which
       side of the debate you are on.
       There be no shelter, here. The front line is everywhere.
