Job growth improves, 175k jobs added in May

   Expectations going into this morning's jobs report were that the
   economy added about 160,000 jobs in May, which would be a slight
   decrease from April. The [3]new figures from the Bureau of Labor
   Statistics were actually a little more encouraging than that.

   The U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in May, slightly better than
   expected, though the overall unemployment rate inched higher to 7.6%.
   (Update: Remember that these minor increases [4]aren't always bad news,
   and occasionally, they're sign of an improving jobs landscape.) As is
   usually the case, there was a gap between the two major sectors --
   America's private sector added 178,000 jobs last month, while spending
   cuts caused the public sector lose 3,000 jobs.

   One key figure to keep in mind, however, was local-government hiring,
   where 13,000 jobs were created. We've grown accustomed to
   municipalities doing the opposite, and if this holds up (and
   continues), it will strengthen the overall job market. (Update: On the
   other hand, federal hiring declined by 45,000 over the last three
   months, suggesting that Congress' sequestration budget cuts are doing
   what they were intended to do -- hurting the economy.)

   May's totals are, of course, preliminary, and will be revised. Indeed,
   the revisions from March and April were a mixed bag -- totals from
   March were revised up a bit, from 142,000 to 138,000, while April's
   figures were revised down rather significantly, from 165,000 to
   149,000.

   All told, job creation in May was the best we've seen since February
   and marks the 39th consecutive month of job growth. For the first five
   months of the calendar year, the economy has added 946,000 jobs
   overall, and 972,000 in the private sector.

   Above you'll find the chart I run on the first Friday of every month,
   showing monthly job losses since the start of the Great Recession. The
   image makes a distinction -- red columns point to monthly job totals
   under the Bush administration, while blue columns point to job totals
   under the Obama administration.

   Update: Here's another chart, this one showing monthly job losses/gains
   in just the private sector since the start of the Great Recession.

   While the number of Americans finding themselves unemployed is
   generally dropping, as shown here, the growth in the wages of working
   Americans over the past decade is pitiful at best:

   As well, over the last quarter, hourly compensation dropped by the
   largest percentage since 1947.

   I couldn't agree more. The cost of living keeps going up, food and
   other necessities are getting harder and harder to afford and people
   are having to take these crappy paying jobs which business owners know
   they have full control over. They know that since competition is so
   fierce JUST TO BE EMPLOYED, it's like a fire sale. As practically
   nothing has been done to discourage corporations from offshoring jobs,
   they know they can still get cheap IT labor and cloud computing
   resources that are managed in a completely different country. While the
   profit margin has increased for corporate interests the employee has
   literally no leverage and MUST accept whatever terms he can get in
   order to just survive.

   It's better in the sense that people will just starve slower.

   Yes but as long as we have a minimum wage the corporate sponsors of the
   right will continue to outsource manufacturing. Again though I see it
   as ironic because now that the Chinese can afford those American made
   products they and the world once graved we no longer make them.

   Benen consistently refuses to state figures in terms of real job
   growth. Look at the final chart. Recognise two things:
     * We need 125,000 to 150,000 new jobs just to keep pace with
       population growth ([23]NYtimes). If he corrected the chart to show
       real growth, many of those months would be little better than zero,
       and many would be in the red. This chart paints the picture we are
       making progress towards filing in the hole. We aren't.
     * Why not include all jobs? Because when you include the cuts in
       government jobs, the picture is even worse.

   Benen points a rosy deceptive picture, and he may be faithfully
   repeating exactly the information that his political contacts are
   feeding him. But that's not journalism. It's propaganda.

   The jobs stories posted each week on maddowblog are at best deceptive
   and at worst propaganda and cause for dismissal. Jobs are the number
   one issue that the people care about, and this bullpucky is the best
   that maddowblog can produce.

   It reflects very poorly on MSNBC. Fortunately, there are still other
   sources of information in the mass media.

   Yes sir why there are so many views out there that you can look around
   and find one that suits you to a tee or if you prefer tea(they have FOX

   The facts are the facts and all else is opinion formulated by the

     Benen consistently refuses to state figures in terms of real job
     growth.

   I read what Steve Benen posted, read your comment and when back up and
   re- read the post.

   It looks to me like he is just reporting the data.

   This includes pointing out differences between private and public jobs.

   There does not appear to be much in the way of propaganda.

   You may be looking for more interpretation and opinion about how poorly
   the economy is doing.

   Ok. Say inflation were running at 20% and the "journalist" consistently
   reported that wages were up 10% and consistently refused to report
   wages in terms of inflation adjusted dollars. Rah rah! See how much
   higher wages are!

   The person would be accurately "reporting the data", as your defense
   implies is sufficient to evade the charge of writing a deceptive story.

   But it would be propaganda. Show me where I have erred.

   Thus as you described we should always ask the proper questions when
   confronted with any report. We also must be aware of the fact that real
   data should be sought from the proper source rather than to rely on
   second hand accounts. One must also learn how to find the source to
   avoid misdirection by some phony site that pops up in google or other
   search engines where it seems the number of opinions are limitless
   while the truth hides on some back page.

   I think we all know that wages have stagnated for decades and we are
   losing ground. In my opinion it is due to the way big business has been
   given a free hand by the government.

   In my opinion it will remain lopsided for a long time because the rich
   now have it all anyway.

   Let's be fair. The guys running these companies are playing by the
   rules agreed to. The rules as they stand make it attractive to automate
   and outsource every job possible from the US, because labor costs here
   are high.

   These companies do not directly see in their spreadsheets the cost of
   destroying the purchasing power of the US consumer- and this blindness
   about this crucial externality is why this is a market failure
   requiring intervention.

   The intervention needed is to make that economic cost visible to those
   companies doing the hiring and firing. If you make it a cost they must
   account for, they will seek the efficient solution to the problem, and
   the system will work properly. The way I propose solving this is just
   one of many ways of surfacing the externality- but for purposes of
   illustration what I propose is exactly what carbon credits do. The more
   jobs a company creates, the more jobs credits it gets. Those companies
   that do not require many employees need to buy jobs credits from those
   companies that have a surplus in order to avoid confiscatory corporate
   taxes.

   The companies will acquiece to such solutions not because they like it,
   but because they know that if left unchecked, we are in a cycle of
   cannibalizing the consumer economy through starvation of US consumer
   purchasing power.

   Think maybe that's on purpose? Given corporate profits under QE, and
   the fear they have that it will be "turned off", do you really think
   they want to see the overall economy (you know, the economy for the

   There is no global demand - Europe and China's economies are both in
   the ditch. Until global demand picks up, there is no need for American
   firms to hire more because of the increased productivity derived
   through technology. Businesses are faced with the increase payroll
   costs from Obamacare and thus its an easy choice to invest in
   automation vs. hiring more employees. Robots, computers and software do
   not have to be paid benefits.

     ...there is no need for American firms to hire more because of the
     increased productivity derived through technology.

   I agree with this statement.

   But it used to be that when productivity went up, the wages went up as
   well.

   Now increased productivity only increases corporate profit but wages
   are stagnant. The disconnect started happening in the 70s - because of
   automation I suppose but also because of union busting.

   This page includes a graph using BLS data.

   Here's a thought. What if the Health Insurance Exchanges work so well
   that there is no longer a need for employer-based insurance? Wouldn't
   that be better for everyone - business and individuals?

   Stock market is way up and corporate profits are way up. So wealthy
   people are happy.

   Wages are not going up, but - hey - a crappy job with crummy wages and
   no benefits is better than nothing and if you complain, someone else
   will happily take the job.

   Job numbers and unemployment figures are not horrible.

   There is no rioting in the streets and if people are suffering, they
   are doing it out of sight.

   And nobody in public office has to take the blame.

   So nothing will be done.

   Get your head out of the sand. The job numbers ARE horrible.

   Take a look at the second chart found in [70]this Hamilton project
   report: Note that the worst case plot line is not at all a worst case
   scenario. It assumes that the US can sustain jobs growth equal the the
   best of the Bush years (2005). So, even assuming rosey job growth which
   we have not achieved so far, it will not be until sometime after 2022
   before we get back to where we were on employment.

   Explain to me how that is not horrible.

   Re: #3.1

   My head is not in the sand.

   Perhaps we should define what horrible job numbers are.

   I think "horrible" would be like we saw in late 2008 and 2009.

   My point is that the job numbers are just good enough so the pressure
   is not on politicians to actually do something abut it.

   (like the frog in boiling water)

   What we need is old-fashioned organizing and street demonstrations to
   demand fair wages and fair treatment. The economy has benefited only
   the top 1%. If the rest of us worked together, maybe things would
   change.

   Wait! That sounds familiar! That's what Occupy tried to do!

   Did you look at the Hamilton report? The numbers aren't good enough.
   They just seem that way due to the propaganda.

   Accurate reporting would bring the pressure onto the politicians,
   because what the employment situation is saying is absolutely
   horrifying. We are looking at steadily lower wages, and no restoration
   of the employment levels of 2008 for at least a decade if ever. That is
   an exceptionally grim picture and is the kind of thing if appreciated
   is the stuff that starts riots.

   It's much cheaper politically to grab popular blogger hacks and feed
   them propaganda that they will dutifully repeat. That is what
   suppresses Occupy.

   Lies in the mass media.

   With the Republican's austerity polices we are basically just keeping
   our heads barely above water. As was just discussed on Last Word with
   Lawrence ODonnell the republicans do their best to make government work
   badly. They refuse to fix the tax code which is so complicated that
   only the wealthy can easily file a return and that is because thier tax
   lawyers do it for them. Bush appointed a horse show administrator to
   head FEMA. They underfund the IRS and then demonize it when over worked
   low level employees use key words like PARTY to filter for political
   active charities. The Republicans want the country to hurt so that they
   can get a republican president and so that they can destroy the
   government that serves the people. They want a plutocracy pure and
   simple.

   America in a delirious coma. Let's face it. Get used to the
   figures.They are here to stay. You have yourselves to blame. As long as
   you cherish weelky sales at your favorite stores and buy ostensably "
   cheap" imported goods from foreign countries, you will not see any job
   creation in America. If you think your wages are low and work
   conditions are not fair, than compare with the people that are
   producing the goods you buy. Start with your socks and underware and
   finish with your smart phones and TVs. The means of production are in
   the hands of the Brand companies that you like, but they have no
   interest in producing/creating jobs in America, it's not profitable to
   do so, as long as you demand a fair wage and fair labor conditions. If
   you don't want to be a slave yourself, eventhough slavery has been
   abolished, you may want to import them, but then stop closing borders,
   turn people away or otherwise discriminate against people willing to
   work in sweat shops or for lower wages. If you don't believe this,
   start dismanteling the statue of liberty and isolate yourself. The
   settlers: artisans, farmers, steelworkers, adventures, aristocrats and
   crooks came to America and built an industrial/agricultural nation and
   not a service/consumer oriented/egotistical society. They worked hard
   and were happy to live a free, unpersecuted, life. Your government is
   dysfunctional, because, as a people, you are divided and dogmatic. If
   you are going to fight for anything

   , fight for jobs in America, and not for more or less guns, dems
   against reps, or any other such subjective/devisive issues.

   It's time to come out of your fantasy world. High unemployment is here
   to stay. Don't expect help from Washington or your Governors, most of
   them are deep in the pockets of special interest groups, that protect
   those that hold the means of production. All you have to do is refuse
   to consume foreign goods, no matter what the brand is! If Jefferson
   were alive, he would tell you the same thing!

   I am curious as to why job sites indicate all these wonderful job
   openings and all those companies tell us all the great things about the
   job including benefits and really most of those positions aren't
   hiring. They are just taking applications. First of all someone needs
   to step up and demand that they acurately portray to the job hunter if
   they are hiring or just taking applications. It would save people a lot
   of time and create less confusion and anxiety. These false
   advertisements are even reported on state and local government jobs
   sites. It only creates false hope for everyone.

   The next thing I am wondering about involves all of these statistics
   concerning jobs created and job growth. We all know that Obamacare has
   unpleasantly affected one's right to hold a full time job. It has
   chipped away at the availability of full time jobs and turned them into
   part time jobs. Many employers have discovered that nasty loop hole in
   the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that says full time
   employees are those working 30 hours or more. Companies are now trying
   to find how low they have to go to keep their employees from working 30
   hours. The company I work for allows employees to work up to 28 hours
   (for now). I've heard others cut off after 24 hours. I guess what I am
   trying to understand is whether these figures that are reported for job
   growth in America are for FT jobs 30+ hrs. a week or all of them
   combined, or even just the 28 hrs. or less jobs. It's sad that people
   will be forced to carry 2 part time jobs and have to pay in their own
   portion of Obamacare or a tax for refusing to participate. If you
   couldn't afford insurance in the first place what makes the politicians
   who support Obamacare think that a person will be able to afford it
   now? We have lower wages, less FT jobs, and higher prices at the pumps
   and groceries, among other things.

   And finally another area that concerns me is the way that states report
   the surge in job growth. These often seem to be the states hard hit by
   natural disasters and forest fires. These disasters wipe out entire
   towns and cities. Of course that creates a job boom to start
   rebuilding. But does that really fill the gap? All those people lost
   their jobs because there was no place to report to. It's assumed that
   people would get hired in a new trade such as construction or building
   roads and bridges in order to create an income. But does that really
   constitute a job boom. It used to be new industries or new types of
   jobs that were created on top of the existing supply of jobs that were
   considered a job boom. Now any job creation seems to constitute a boom.
   I would also like to see more honest reporting that includes the number
   of jobs lost in each sector over the period. And finally list the
   number of Americans who have at least one (PT) job and are still
   looking for another, who have no jobs and are still looking, the number
   of students getting ready to graduate in a year or less and enter the
   job market, the lucky number of individuals who still have normal full
   time jobs with benefits and finally the number of people who have just
   given up and aren't looking anymore. I'd like to see an article that
   acurately represents all sides to show where America stands as a global
   leader or loser. Only then can we productively talk about where and how
   to make changes. Of course all of this hinges on honest reporting and
   then making an honest effort as Americans to create the changes
   ourselves by electing completely new government officials in every
   position and laying a new foundation that will define the plans and
   strategies of the future. Oh and we need to get rid of Obamacare!
