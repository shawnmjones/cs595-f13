   NEW YORK (CNNMoney)

Wall Street suffered its worst day of the year Thursday, one day after
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke raised fears the central bank may be
preparing to wind down its stimulus policies this year.

   The [27]Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 353 points, or 2.3%. That
   marked the biggest one-day point drop since November 2011. Including
   Wednesday's losses, the Dow has erased more than 550 points in two
   days.

   Despite the punishing losses, the Dow has seen much darker days. It
   fell [28]778 points on Sept. 29, 2008, after Congress rejected a $700
   billion plan to rescue the banking industry. (Track the [29]Dow 30)

   The [30]S&P 500 sank 2.5% Thursday, logging its biggest percentage drop
   since November 2011. The [31]Nasdaq sank more than 2.3%.

   Bernanke lays his cards on the table. The rout came after Bernanke
   offered some of his most explicit guidance about when the central bank
   might start pulling back its stimulus.

   Depending on how the economy performs, Bernanke said the [33]Fed could
   begin tapering its bond buying later this year and end the program some
   time in 2014. At the same time, he said the Fed could step up its
   stimulus efforts if the economy take a turn for the worse.

   While this is what [34]most economists had predicted, investors seemed
   surprised to hear Bernanke spell it out in such detail.

   "He offered more clarity and transparency than many had expected," said
   Art Hogan, managing director at Lazard Capital Markets.

   It's going to be a bumpy ride. Dan Greenhaus, chief market strategist
   at BTIG in New York, said the initial reaction to Bernanke's comments
   was overdone. But he said a period of choppy trading is to be expected
   following the strong gains stocks booked earlier this year. All three
   indexes are still up between 11% and 12% for the year.

   The Fed has been a major driver of the bull market, and traders say the
   shift in policy will continue to fuel volatility in the months ahead.

   The VIX ([35]VIX), a benchmark of investor anxiety, jumped 28%
   Thursday. And CNNMoney's [36]Fear & Greed Index slid back into extreme
   fear.

   "I think volatility is the new norm as investors in all asset classes
   try to re-price what the world looks like in the absence of
   quantitative easing," said Hogan. "That's not an easy thing to do."

   Meanwhile, bond yields continued to move higher, with the [37]10-year
   Treasury yield rising as high as 2.46%. ([38]Related: Bond yields spike
   to 2-year high)

   The dollar rose versus its main trading partners as investors sought
   safety in cash. The strong dollar weighed on commodities that are
   priced in the U.S. currency. [39]Gold prices plunged 6% to the lowest
   level since September 2010. [40]Oil prices sank 3.3% to below $95 a
   barrel.

   Major [42]European markets fell by more than 3%. [43]Asian markets also
   saw hefty losses after HSBC's flash purchasing managers' index for June
   showed [44]Chinese manufacturing activity at a 9-month low. Hong Kong's
   [45]Hang Seng and the [46]Shanghei Composite both shed nearly 3%.

   U.S. investors were also rattled by the lackluster reports out of
   China, noted Hogan. "The reaction to the Fed is not happening in a
   vacuum," he said.

   In economic news, the government said the number of [48]jobless claims
   rose more than expected in the latest week. A measure of manufacturing
   activity in the Philadelphia area surged to a two year high in June.
   Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors said [49]existing home
   sales in May rose 4.2% to an annual rate of 5.18 million, slightly
   better than expected.

   Shares of major homebuilders were among the worst performers as
   investors fear rising mortgage rates will hurt the housing market. Toll
   Brothers ([50]TOL), D.R. Horto ([51]DHI)n and Lennar ([52]LEN) were all
   down sharply.

   The sharp drop in gold prices weighed on shares of mining companies,
   including Newmont Mining ([53]NEM, [54]Fortune 500) and
   Freeport-McMoRan ([55]FCX, [56]Fortune 500).

   On the corporate front, drugstore chain Rite Aid ([58]RAD, [59]Fortune
   500) swung to a profit but revenue declined in the latest quarter.

   Tech giant Oracle ([60]ORCL, [61]Fortune 500) reported earnings in line
   with forecasts but sales fell short of expectations. The company also
   doubled its dividend and announced a $12 billion stock buyback. Oracle
   also said it plans to move its listing to the New York Stock Exchange
   as of July 15.. [62]To top of page
