This wasn't about inspirational oratory; this was a war-time president charting a new, more constructive course when it comes combating terrorism.</p><p>Indeed, it was arguably a key moment in marking a possible end of the 9/11 era. [<em>Update</em>: Transcript <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-barack-obama">here</a>.]</p><p>It's a little tough to summarize, largely because the president covered so much ground, and for detailed analysis, I'd strongly encourage you to tune in to tonight's The Rachel Maddow Show. But for now, let's talk a bit about Obama's approach to national security going forward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[M]ake no mistake: our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. We must recognize, however, that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11."</p>
</blockquote><p>This isn't what the right wants to hear, of course, but it's very much in line with the assessments of nearly all credible experts on counter-terrorism. The nature of the threat has changed, and a responsible U.S. policy must change with it. That the president realizes this is a low bar to clear, but it's nevertheless encouraging.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"America is at a crossroads. We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us, mindful of James Madison's warning that 'No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.' Neither I, nor any President, can promise the total defeat of terror. We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human beings, nor stamp out every danger to our open society. What we can do -- what we must do -- is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger, and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend. To define that strategy, we must make decisions based not on fear, but hard-earned wisdom."</p>
</blockquote><p>Right. The "total defeat" of a possible terrorist threat, now and forever, is not going to happen, and basing a national foreign policy on such a goal is counter-productive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[W]e must define our effort not as a boundless 'global war on terror' -- but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America."</p>
</blockquote><p>It's a genuine relief to hear a president say this out loud.</p>
<hr class="excerptEnd" />
<blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">"[A]s our fight enters a new phase, America's legitimate claim of self-defense cannot be the end of the discussion. To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance. For the same human progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it. That's why, over the last four years, my Administration has worked vigorously to establish a framework that governs our use of force against terrorists -- insisting upon clear guidelines, oversight and accountability that is now codified in Presidential Policy Guidance that I signed yesterday."</span></p>
</blockquote><p>All of this was in reference to drone strikes, and while I'm glad the policy has been codified, it's worth emphasizing that this policy was signed "yesterday." That said, Obama went on to explain the fact that the "need for unmanned strikes" will "reduce" once the war in Afghanistan ends, that the U.S. "does not take strikes when we have the ability to capture individual terrorists," and that Congress "is briefed on every strike that America takes."</p><p>And what of the civilian deaths? "For me, and those in my chain of command, these deaths will haunt us as long as we live, just as we are haunted by the civilian casualties that have occurred through conventional fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq."</p><p>As for the Stand with Rand crowd, the president added, "For the record, I do not believe it would be constitutional for the government to target and kill any U.S. citizen -- with a drone, or a shotgun -- without due process. Nor should any President deploy armed drones over U.S. soil."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I believe, however, that the use of force must be seen as part of a larger discussion about a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy. Because for all the focus on the use of force, force alone cannot make us safe. We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root; and in the absence of a strategy that reduces the well-spring of extremism, a perpetual war -- through drones or Special Forces or troop deployments -- will prove self-defeating, and alter our country in troubling ways."</p>
</blockquote><p>In this context, it was especially heartening to hear the president tout the benefits of foreign aid as being "fundamental to our national security and any sensible long-term strategy to battle extremism."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Justice Department's investigation of national security leaks offers a recent example of the challenges involved in striking the right balance between our security and our open society. As Commander-in Chief, I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field. To do so, we must enforce consequences for those who break the law and breach their commitment to protect classified information. But a free press is also essential for our democracy. I am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable. Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those who break the law."</p>
</blockquote><p>A media shield law will still be a heavy lift in Congress, but I'm glad it's part of Obama's comprehensive vision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The AUMF is now nearly twelve years old. The Afghan War is coming to an end. Core al Qaeda is a shell of its former self. Groups like AQAP must be dealt with, but in the years to come, not every collection of thugs that labels themselves al Qaeda will pose a credible threat to the United States. Unless we discipline our thinking and our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we don't need to fight, or continue to grant Presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states. So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF's mandate. And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further. Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue. But this war, like all wars, must end. That's what history advises. That's what our democracy demands."</p>
</blockquote><p>This is no small moment. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the United States adopted a war footing -- and never stopped. What Obama is describing here is a fundamental shift.</p><p>As for the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, this is when protestors began interrupting the speech, but Obama nevertheless characterized the prison as a facility that needs to be closed and "should never have been opened." The president is asking for Congress to lift the restrictions; he's appointing a new envoy to complete transfers; and he will demand "judicial review be available for every detainee."</p><p>And what about those protestors? It was interesting to hear Obama express some sympathy for their perspective, saying he's willing to cut one of his interrupting critics "some slack, because it's worth being passionate about." After another interruption, he added, "The voice of that woman is worth paying attention to. Obviously I do not agree with much of what she said. And obviously she wasn't listening to me and much of what I said. But these are tough issues, and the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong."</p><p>It would have been easy for the president to ignore these critics, or dismiss their outbursts as fringe nonsense. I'm glad Obama chose a more substantive approach.</p><p>These are just some of the elements from my notes, and whether you agree with it or not, the video of the speech is worth your time. For real analysis, I'd strongly recommend tuning into MSNBC tonight at 9 p.m. eastern.</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>They either send in a special forces group, or use a drone to take the person out while they are on Israeli soil.</p>
<p>Would the Obama administration allow them the same rights that we claim?</p></div>

<p>I like Obama speeches, but I don't get what traction he thinks this will give him.  If we didn't have 60 votes in the Senate for non universal background checks after 20 young children were brutally slaughtered, what makes the President think a speech is going to deliver the 60 votes needed to take back the War Powers blank check?  And what about the House?  Is Boehner going away, or can we see him singing anti- perpetual war songs?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Once again, I don't see much of anything happening with this or any other substantive policy question until we take back the House and blow away the rules requiring 60 votes to get anything done in the Senate.</p></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76449487,&quot;threadId&quot;:&quot;3731043&quot;,&quot;contentId&quot;:&quot;18451126&quot;,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;johnmesserly&quot;}"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><div class="label">2 votes</div></li></ul></div><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c76449487" title="Link to this comment">#1.6</a> - Thu May 23, 2013 9:14 PM EDT</span></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment showAvatars commentbody child " id="c76450715"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76450715,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;randpmillaolcom&quot;,&quot;authorDisplayName&quot;:&quot;RANDPMILL@AOL.COM&quot;}"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal"><a href="http://randpmillaolcom.newsvine.com/"><img class="comment_author_avatar" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/blank.gif" data-avatar_src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/av/60x60/msnbc.jpg" width="35" height="35" alt="Comment author avatar" data-is_default_avatar="true" /></a><a href="http://randpmillaolcom.newsvine.com/">RANDPMILL@AOL.COM</a></div></div><div id="commentText_76450715" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>dog, yes as long as iran was at war with israel or the killer had fled to israel to escape being captured or killed. if you are talking about the use of drones as a killing machine, you are not so naive as to think we don't have secret agreements with almost all of the arab countries do you? when we are in a war footing as we are now, almost anything goes, almost. to follow an enemy to a foreign country and kill them is certainly not unusual, perhaps the method, but not the result. i think you would agree that to give enemy combatants a safe haven anywhere in the world would be a huge mistake on our part. as the president said it will be virtually impossible to totally eliminate all terrorist groups, but we must do what we can as a nation to protect ourselves from the harm that these people will do to us whenever they can. war is a dirty, slimy, bloody mess, and many innocent people get killed. that unfortunately is what you get involved in while trying to protect the people.</p></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76450715,&quot;threadId&quot;:&quot;3731043&quot;,&quot;contentId&quot;:&quot;18451126&quot;,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;randpmillaolcom&quot;}"></div><ul class="list"></ul></div><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c76450715" title="Link to this comment">#1.7</a> - Thu May 23, 2013 9:59 PM EDT</span></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment showAvatars commentbody child " id="c76463796"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76463796,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;drpaultyler&quot;,&quot;authorDisplayName&quot;:&quot;drpaultyler&quot;}"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal"><a href="http://drpaultyler.newsvine.com/"><img class="comment_author_avatar" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/blank.gif" data-avatar_src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=drpaultyler24F7B2B8-1891-EC97-9D9A-1B70BC7253A3.jpg&width=60" width="35" height="35" alt="Comment author avatar" data-is_default_avatar="false" /></a><a href="http://drpaultyler.newsvine.com/">drpaultyler</a></div></div><div id="commentText_76463796" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p><a href="http://indialecarre.newsvine.com/">India LeCarre</a></p>

<p>You've obviously never spent any time in a prison or a jail cell. People who are innocent of any crime are thrown in jails and prisons every day in this country, tortured, and deprived of every single constitutional right. The ideal is nice, but the reality is far different.</p>

<p>F the media!  The media not victims.  They hardly ever do their jobs, anyway.</p>
<p>I bet the media got all excited about that part of his speech, and it's probably the only part a lot of the media heard.  But, before that, President Obama said he believes the Justice Dept. also has a right to do their jobs, and pursue, and prosecute people who leak classified information, because it's a crime.  President Obama did not say the Justice Dept. would stop investigating leaks.  Basically, President Obama proposed more "protections" for the media, but said the Justice Dept. will still prosecute people who leak classified information, if they catch them.  In a way, President Obama kind of gave the media the middle-finger.</p></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76443077,&quot;threadId&quot;:&quot;3731043&quot;,&quot;contentId&quot;:&quot;18451126&quot;,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;thejerk1980&quot;}"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><div class="label">2 votes</div></li></ul></div><img class="replybutton" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/b_reply_mini.gif" width="35" height="12" alt="Reply" /><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c76443077" title="Link to this comment">#4</a> - Thu May 23, 2013 5:27 PM EDT</span><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment showAvatars commentbody child " id="c76443193"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76443193,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;whomitmay&quot;,&quot;authorDisplayName&quot;:&quot;whomitmay&quot;}"></div><a name="star3"></a><div class="c_author"><div class="normal"><a href="#star4" class="noborder star"><img src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/b_star.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" title="Jump To Next Highly Rated Comment" /></a><a href="http://whomitmay.newsvine.com/"><img class="comment_author_avatar" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/blank.gif" data-avatar_src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=whomitmay1A34A394-7636-CB1D-6C61-9055ACF2E228.jpg&width=60" width="35" height="35" alt="Comment author avatar" data-is_default_avatar="false" /></a><a href="http://whomitmay.newsvine.com/">whomitmay</a></div></div><div id="commentText_76443193" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>Right just like every other president has done with people who leaked government secrets of covert operations, in fact in WWII if someone leaked information to the press on an on going operation they would have been shot.

On a media website. I'm not sure where you get your news, but that is of little consequence. If the DOJ can silence whistleblowers by seizing their contact information and tapping their phones, the days of getting any news the government doesn't want released are over. If the sources don't talk, then the media can't report. At that point, websites like this one are wasted server space. </p>
<p>@joca41: That headline example isn't comparable to what happened here. The story that sparked the DOJ investigation was about a military action that had already happened, and in no way put our troops at risk. </p>
<p>And as for the public's right to know </p>
<p>@Glenn: The supreme court ruled in NY Times V. United States that even in the face of impending nuclear holocaust, the government doesn't have the right to impede the freedom of the press. That's pretty close to a quote Justice Brennan wrote, striking the governments ability to censor the press. </p>
<p>What if we were talking about the 2nd amendment? Would you all be saying f*ck the NRA? Because basically what you're all saying is that the 1st Amendment should be thrown out.

I do not like any of it, but when we have extremists attacking us, drones beat boots on the ground? I want neither, I want an end to all this.</p>
<p>I can't stand innocents harmed or dying for extremist actions.</p>
<p>All I can say is, if people had turned in AQ, OBL and tried on their own to quell extremists in their own land, maybe we would not be in this situation.</p>
<p>Kuwait asked for our help, we had Saudis wanting our help. We saw the problem of Saddam torching oil wells. Then OBL decides he would call Jihad against <em>us</em>. We moved our base out of S.A. Protectionism, is that really preferable to just getting along?</p>
<p>What can I say? I wish <em>none</em> of that stuff happened. I wish OBL had not decided he wanted a war with us and attack innocents in NYC.</p>
<p>I wish Afghanistan had more than heroin and oil to sell and had their own interests. I wish Saddam had not decided to take Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. We try to help, we see the upside to girls learning. But extremists do not want that, they feel we bring Western culture there, but we were invited there. Westerners buy oil and heroin, but just buy it, go away and stay out.</p>
<p>I never wanted to attack Iraq. Justice was needed, but no justice found until we find OBL in Pakistan, where they have nukes. Now we have murders in Boston, London and wherever lust for the blood shows next.</p>
<p>Some day I hope for peace.

It is a difficult lesson for the common person who believes he will never live again.</p></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76446205,&quot;threadId&quot;:&quot;3731043&quot;,&quot;contentId&quot;:&quot;18451126&quot;,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;repooplicons&quot;}"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><div class="label">2 votes</div></li></ul></div><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c76446205" title="Link to this comment">#6.3</a> - Thu May 23, 2013 7:26 PM EDT</span></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment showAvatars commentbody child " id="c76446677"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76446677,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;sandyc954&quot;,&quot;authorDisplayName&quot;:&quot;sandyc954&quot;}"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal"><a href="http://sandyc954.newsvine.com/"><img class="comment_author_avatar" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/blank.gif" data-avatar_src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=sandyc954508CABD8-29C5-8E38-4000-6320D55A0014.jpg&width=60" width="35" height="35" alt="Comment author avatar" data-is_default_avatar="false" /></a><a href="http://sandyc954.newsvine.com/">sandyc954</a></div></div><div id="commentText_76446677" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>Patango, that would have been much more preferable, IMO. We could say, if you hand over OBL, we will try him, find him guilty and appropriate justice. What would you like done? You can start other businesses than heroin. They may request arms, then I don't know. I am not really supportive of arming people in foreign lands.</p>
<p>I hate to think that war would be the first option.</p>
<p>We spent all that money anyway. We might still have those 4000+ alive and however many thousands of dead Iraqis.</p>
<p>I am pretty much a pacifist. There is some kind of "justification" to attack those that attack you. Although in Tibet they project peace outward and in the New Testament we are told to turn the other cheek and love our enemies.</p>
<p>Live by the sword, die by the sword.

The real question is what is the percentage of those who follow Islam are terrorists? Is it greater, less, or the same, as those here who, calling themselves Christians, advocate, and carry out, the murder of medical professionals who perform abortions? Are you advocating we presume <strong>all</strong> Muslims are guilty until proven innocent? And if so, would that standard also apply to <strong>all</strong> Christians in this country?</p>
<p>Acts of terrorism should be treated exactly as what they are: <strong>crimes</strong>. Let the FBI, Interpol and the police forces of those countries involved handle acts of terrorism just as they handle all other criminal acts. Use of military force should always be the last resort, <strong>not</strong> the "go to" solution for frightened politicians.</p>

<p>Innocent people die in military action. It sucks for the people, and those who know them, but the alternative is to have many more innocent people killed.</p>
</p>
<p>It's hard for some people to wrap their head around the argument, they don't see humanity as a whole, that a few people being killed in a military strike, while sad and tragic, has little impact on the population of humanity as a whole. Thousands of people are born and die every day. Human life is precious, but not so precious we should let crazy people kill thousands or more later just because we're so against a few innocent people getting killed now.</p>
</p>
<p>Sounds barbaric morally, but it makes sense in terms of the numbers and the survival of the human race, or at least the less violent of us.</p></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76454981,&quot;threadId&quot;:&quot;3731043&quot;,&quot;contentId&quot;:&quot;18451126&quot;,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;partyvan1&quot;}"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><div class="label">1 vote</div></li></ul></div><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c76454981" title="Link to this comment">#10.4</a> - Fri May 24, 2013 1:53 AM EDT</span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><img class="replybutton" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/b_reply_mini.gif" width="35" height="12" alt="Reply" /></div><div class="commentcontainer"><span></span></div></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment showAvatars commentbody " id="c76445577"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76445577,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;repooplicons&quot;,&quot;authorDisplayName&quot;:&quot;joseph common&quot;}"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal"><a href="http://repooplicons.newsvine.com/"><img class="comment_author_avatar" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/blank.gif" data-avatar_src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=repooplicons1EDE3AD3-DE6F-C36D-A3DC-1CA8BA954374.jpg&width=60" width="35" height="35" alt="Comment author avatar" data-is_default_avatar="false" /></a><a href="http://repooplicons.newsvine.com/">joseph common</a></div></div><div id="commentText_76445577" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>the biggest difference between DRONING and not droning is the relationship of society to undesireable behavior and the difference is night and day</p>
<p>using drones. the society as a whole is at war which changes the relationships between the persons comprising the society so as to implement within one's own personal relationship - ultimatum to others... "FRIEND OR FOE"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>without DRONE-WAR the interpersonal relationships can be presumed to be acceptable vs challenged!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>droneless-no-war is a PRIMARY STATE because it FREES the person to have a positive attitude to strangers, familiars and associates and not be forced to being judgemental. The incidence of undesireable behavior - as in an attack of sorts - is then treated as a CRIME.</p>
<p>This is overall also healthier in that it reduces anxitety and apprehension which lowers blood pressure.</p>
<p>This is also healthier in that it quashes the bad side effect of "taking sides" then having to subscribe and run a self fulfilling prophecy towards the armageddon syndrome - a really sick manifestation.</p>
<p>When Brother Barack gets back to declaring all such incidences as crimes, people can go back to having NORMAL NEGOTIABLE RESPECT-OF-DIFFERENCES RELATIONSHIPS.</p>
<p>Obviously any leftover hangover sect of insect-styled groups that seek to anhilate others as being "the enemy" need to be watched in the event any member loses it completely. But that is a state of caution not a state of war.</p></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76445577,&quot;threadId&quot;:&quot;3731043&quot;,&quot;contentId&quot;:&quot;18451126&quot;,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;repooplicons&quot;}"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><div class="label">1 vote</div></li></ul></div><img class="replybutton" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/b_reply_mini.gif" width="35" height="12" alt="Reply" /><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c76445577" title="Link to this comment">#11</a> - Thu May 23, 2013 7:05 PM EDT</span><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="commentcontainer"><span></span></div></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment showAvatars commentbody " id="c76446112"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76446112,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;fb-nommeyoung100003510013560&quot;,&quot;authorDisplayName&quot;:&quot;Nomme Young&quot;}"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal"><a href="http://fb-nommeyoung100003510013560.newsvine.com/"><img class="comment_author_avatar" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/blank.gif" data-avatar_src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F2F1748844277.jpg&width=60" width="35" height="35" alt="Comment author avatar" data-is_default_avatar="false" /></a><a href="http://fb-nommeyoung100003510013560.newsvine.com/">Nomme Young</a></div></div><div id="commentText_76446112" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>Bravo PresiD!

<p>At Arm&rsquo;s Length</p>
<p>President Barak Obama, the Pragmatic, Philosophical Poetry Man, sir, first I must say that you are a wonderful Role Model of an Enlightened Human Being.</p>
<p>The honest and candidly forthright Conversation that you had with the Citizens of the United States of America and the World today about the difficulties, complexities, vagaries, definitions (past, present and possible future), and changing meanings, policies and strategies of the seeming Forever (Perpetual) War, Guantanamo Bay Prison and Drones was refreshingly surprising, and well Intentioned.  You are an Intelligent, Compassionate, Honorable and Well Intentioned Human Being.</p>
<p>After 9/11, the Whole Wide World was turned into a Battlefield of Terrorism.  Ah, the Shifting Sands, and Faces, and Places of Terrorism.What a slippery, electrifyingly destructive oil and blood spill Terrorism thrives and suicidally dies within.  And look at the U.S. of A. and the rest of the World now, constantly trying to track down and locate whatever cracks or crevices of our Security Armor and Defenses the contagious Terrorist ooze has infested and infected.  Oops !  It&rsquo;s hard to truly See what lies sliding around within the Human Heart at times.  Especially during times of a Forever War&rsquo;s endless supply of hurts, hatreds, and grisly pains.</p>
<p>President Barak Obama, sir, I was so impressed and touched by the Respect you attributed to, and bestowed upon, the Protester&rsquo;s Voice of Sincere Universal Conscience concerning the closing of Gitmo and the deadly Use of Drones.  Thank you, sir, for Honoring her as a Citizen&rsquo;s Voice Worthy of and Needing to be Heard.  You do Great Honor to your Office and our Great Nation, sir.</p>
<p>Thank you for admitting to being Haunted by the Human Beings, guilty and innocent, that you have ordered to be killed by Drones, and by the means and troops of Conventional War in the Middle East.  Thank you for drawing down the Wars, and for Asking everyone to Look at the World of Wars that we are choosing to Create through the struggles inherent within the heinous and Senseless Acts of Terrorism.  Terrorists who seek violence as a form of accepted Behavior Modification to get more Powerful Nations to pay attention to their Needs and Demands, and respond to them, because like an Abandoned or Neglected child, any Attention is better than no Attention at All. </p>
<p>Drones are frightening to Human Beings because they are intrusive, stealthy, emotionless, deadly Machines.</p>
<p>Perhaps The Matrix Guys are right in many ways.  The Machines - All Machines are swallowing People up in varying degrees, and realms of UnRealities, Singular Realities and Multi-verse Realities.</p>
<p>Drones fly by and click, click your Face and Activities show up half way around the World in SomeOne else&rsquo;s nosy, sneaky little Reality for whatever Reasonings they deem to be important.</p>
<p>Drones fly by and click, click another Living Human Being is gunned down or blown to smithereens for whatever Reasonings are deemed to be important by another Human Being (or Chosen Group of Human Beings).  What was, is no more.  One Reality is traded for another.</p>
<p>What makes it even more complex is that Human Beings are Addicted to Machines.  We are not merely Dis-tracted, and being Energetically changed by them.  We are Addicted to them.</p>
<p>In a few years, we&rsquo;ll have Re-habilitation Clinics opening up around the World to Help get our Children, Family Members and Friends Freed from the Addiction of constantly being Turned On to and by - Stimulated and Living Inside Of Machines.  And the Fake/Pretend Virtual Worlds We all escape into in order to Create and Re-Create the various Selves and Lifetimes we&rsquo;d like to Live, but Can&rsquo;t, or Won&rsquo;t, or Don&rsquo;t have enough Time to Live, at the Push of a Button - the Click of a Mouse&hellip;..</p>
<p>A World of Downloaded Lives and Living instead of Living in the Organic Realities We are Choosing more and more to ignore, neglect or leave behind.</p>
<p>A Machine World where We can Hide and/or Reveal Our Secret Selves or Our Truer Selves inside Our Computers - Our Machines.</p>
<p>A World where We can all Live Our Lives at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Drones Do.  What Drones Represent - a Reality delivering Death at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Gitmo Represents.  A Festering, Infectious and UnHealed National Wound.  A gangrenous Collective Wound filled with All of 9/11&rsquo;s Pain, Fears. Hatreds, Regrets, Loss, UnCertainties, Needs for Punishing Revenge and Destruction of the Other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that the Gitmo Prisoners are Starving ThemSelves.  Gitmo is based upon a Nation&rsquo;s Collective Starvation from its Own Laws and Sense of and Mechanics of Justice.  A Nation Starved for its Own True Healing. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Starving Gitmo Prisoners kept for years upon Foreign Soil.  A National Humiliation and UnFinished Business Kept at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>Some in Our Congress keep Poverty at Arm&rsquo;s Length, making it easier to make their cuts and lacerations into the Lives of the Jobless Poor, the Working Poor and the diminishing Middle Class.</p>
<p>Some in Our Congress and Courts keep the crippling affects/effects of the Wall Street Gambling Algorithm addicted and addictions to restless movements of any kind - impulses and receptivity of any kind - distractions of any kind, and, oh yes, Power of any kind - at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>Some in Our Congress keep the Hungry and UnEducated Children of Sequestration, and the Elderly cut off from Meals-on-Wheels by Sequestration at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>Some in Our Congress, and some of Our Governors continue to fight against those Needing Affordable Healthcare at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>Some in Our Congress continue to keep Immigrants from Seeking Refuge, and a New and Better Life of Opportunities in America at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>Some in Our Congress keep Women and Men who are raped in the Military at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>Some in Our Congress keep Gays from Seeking Equal Human Rights under the Law at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>Some in Our Congress keep Veterans returning from Our Wars Dis-abled or looking for Work at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>And the List goes on, and on&hellip;at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>We have BeCome a Nation kept at Arm&rsquo;s Length, Living in a World that some in Our Congress would like to keep at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>UnFortunately, that sort of Energetic Karma does have a tendency to Gobble Individuals and Collectives Up and Spit Them Out into the Black Void of Cosmic Oblivion eventually.  But, not to worry, because the Remains BeCome the Cosmic Stuff of New Worlds and New Realities kept at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p>
<p>However, you, President Barak Obama are a proven Leader, whom I may not always agree with, but whose Honorable, Thoughtfully Wise and Compassionate Soul this Citizen will never Seek to hold at Arm&rsquo;s Length.</p></p></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76453490,&quot;threadId&quot;:&quot;3731043&quot;,&quot;contentId&quot;:&quot;18451126&quot;,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;leahsellers&quot;}"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><div class="label">2 votes</div></li></ul></div><img class="replybutton" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/b_reply_mini.gif" width="35" height="12" alt="Reply" /><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c76453490" title="Link to this comment">#18</a> - Thu May 23, 2013 11:59 PM EDT</span><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment showAvatars commentbody child " id="c76454064"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76454064,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;xxxooo3&quot;,&quot;authorDisplayName&quot;:&quot;xxx ooo&quot;}"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal"><a href="http://xxxooo3.newsvine.com/"><img class="comment_author_avatar" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/blank.gif" data-avatar_src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=xxxooo366D94E87-18A9-D1B8-334D-153648E7ECE6.jpg&width=60" width="35" height="35" alt="Comment author avatar" data-is_default_avatar="false" /></a><a href="http://xxxooo3.newsvine.com/">xxx ooo</a></div></div><div id="commentText_76454064" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>And he has kept his zipper shut.</p>

<p>The  political background of the speech must include the Republicans'  self-contradictory position involving their enthusiastic support of the  war on terror and their simultaneous opposition to increasing the powers  of the presidency as that seemingly perpetual war continues. In  "Democracy in America," Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out that the  longer the war, the more power accumulated by the executive: "No  protracted war can fail to endanger the freedom of a democratic  country....it must almost compulsorily concentrate the direction of all  men and the management of all things in the hands of the administration.  If it does not lead to despotism by sudden violence, it prepares men  for it more gently by their habits. All those who seek to destroy the  liberties of a democratic nation ought to know that [perpetual] war is  the surest and the shortest means to accomplish it."<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/opinion/obama-vows-to-end-of-the-perpetual-war.html?comments#permid=66"><br /></a></p></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76457892,&quot;threadId&quot;:&quot;3731043&quot;,&quot;contentId&quot;:&quot;18451126&quot;,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;darkmirror&quot;}"></div><ul class="list"></ul></div><img class="replybutton" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/b_reply_mini.gif" width="35" height="12" alt="Reply" /><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c76457892" title="Link to this comment">#22</a> - Fri May 24, 2013 9:09 AM EDT</span><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="commentcontainer"><span></span></div></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment showAvatars commentbody " id="c76470329"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="{&quot;commentId&quot;:76470329,&quot;authorDomain&quot;:&quot;wegotrights&quot;,&quot;authorDisplayName&quot;:&quot;GotRights?&quot;}"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal"><a href="http://wegotrights.newsvine.com/"><img class="comment_author_avatar" src="http://www.cdn.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/blank.gif" data-avatar_src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=wegotrights590DCAE3-563B-1D4B-0622-B042CC47CDCB.jpg&width=60" width="35" height="35" alt="Comment author avatar" data-is_default_avatar="false" /></a><a href="http://wegotrights.newsvine.com/">GotRights?</a></div></div><div id="commentText_76470329" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>Umm,... 44: The war on terror, "like all wars, must end" Try telling that to the victims of terrorism and the terrorists that are trying to kill you and us all.
