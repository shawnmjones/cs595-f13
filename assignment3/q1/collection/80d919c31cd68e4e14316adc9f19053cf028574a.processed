[68]Richardson: 'Biden would run' regardless of Hillary Clinton's plans

   [69]CNN's Ashley Killough

   (CNN) - If former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton decides to run for
   president in 2016, her White House bid would clear the Democratic
   primary field, some pundits argue, making it difficult for any other
   candidates to stand a chance.

   But former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson doubts that would be the
   case and argued that Vice President Joe Biden, another potential
   contender, would not defer to Clinton.
   "I think he would run. Hillary Clinton would be formidable, no question
   about it. But I've known Biden over the years. He is somebody who's
   always wanted to be present," Richardson, a Democrat who ran for
   president in 2008, said on ABC's "This Week."

   Richardson pointed to Biden's recent stops, which include a speaking
   engagement Friday night in South Carolina, the first-in-the-South
   primary state.

   "I think there could be a face-off, but obviously Secretary Clinton is
   a formidable candidate who not only is appealing to the Democratic base
   but is appealing to a Republican base who acknowledges the great work
   she did as secretary of state," Richardson said.

   Former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, a conservative Republican who
   resigned from the Senate to lead The Heritage Foundation, a Washington
   think tank, disagreed that Clinton would receive support from many
   Republicans.

   "She represents a third term of continuing in the same direction," he
   said on the same program. "I think Republicans don't need to focus on
   who's running right now, but what are the ideas that can inspire the
   American people."

   Two national polls last week indicated Clinton would have a strong lead
   in the Democratic primary - more than 60% - with Biden coming in at a
   distant second at around 12% to 13%. One of the polls, a Quinnipiac
   University poll, surveyed the field without Clinton in the picture. In
   such a scenario, Biden jumps up to 45%, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo
   at 15%.

   Democratic strategist James Carville, who recently signed on to help a
   pro-Clinton super PAC, said he's "not seen one Democrat in the country
   that does not want her to run."

   As for the Republican primary, Carville threw out a relatively new name
   in national politics: Sen. Ted Cruz, a freshman from Texas who seems to
   have presidential aspirations. The conservative Republican gave a
   speech less than 2 miles from Biden's appearance Friday night in South
   Carolina, stoking further 2016 speculation.

   "This guy is something," Carville said. "I don't agree with him; I
   think he's out there. But I'm telling you, he's more talented than all
   of these other guys."

       Bill Richardson is acting like an idiot-is this internal politics??
       Nonsense. Four years is long way. Quit. Act like a normal man. Now
       this nation is on right track.

       Ha Ha Ha.
       Poor Biden doesn't know his place in the Dem pecking order. Get
       ready for the whole Mideast mess to get dumped on him. Poor sod
       probably doesn't even see it coming.

       I'd support either Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton. Both are
       magnificent Americans! I can't see any way I'd be tempted to vote
       for a Republican. The GOP seems to be nothing more than intolerant
       bigots funded by corporate fat-cats.

       Hillary will run!!!!
       May 5, 2013 06:43 pm at 6:43 pm |
    6. Thomas
       That's my friend is how the GOP could win.
       I hope Biden and Clinton work it out before the money game starts .
       Why not a Clinton / Kerry ticket and make Biden secretary of state
       ?

       Biden or Clinton either one is more of the same policies. That
       wouldn't be so bad except those policies are mostly failures. One
       only needs to look at the growth of the food stamp program or our
       unemployment rates to see how we'll these policies have worked. We
       are not creating enough jobs for the kids graduating school much
       less the millions that have been jobless for the past 4 years. So
       they are both steps backwards as far as policy goes.

       Someone should ask James...what good does talent do ,if one is
       crazy and misguided!!! Carville would love to see Cruz run ....end
       of republicans as we know them.

       I would love to see this senile buffoon run for president. The
       entertainment value would be priceless

       Hillary Clinton is going to suffer some severe damage when all the
       Benghazi whistleblowers testify to her incompetence in the State
       Dept. that resulted in the deaths of 4 Americans, including an
       American ambassador. Biden is wise to stay in the race.
       May 5, 2013 09:41 pm at 9:41 pm |
   12. andi lee
       I personally hope Clinton will be behind bars, serving time, for
       accessory to murder, on 4 counts.
       May 5, 2013 09:44 pm at 9:44 pm |
   13. como1
       Hillary is getting scalped over Benghazi CNN where is your
       coverage?
       May 5, 2013 10:43 pm at 10:43 pm |
   14. ralphco
       wow I hope so - even democrats couldn't vote for that guy - he's
       either drunk all the time or is as clueless as Palin - either way,
       much easier to beat the Hilary - of course she's telling lies about
       Benghazi - that won't upset the liberals though.
       May 6, 2013 01:35 am at 1:35 am |
   15. Getoverit
       Uncle Joe and Hillary "Benghazi" Clinton. What a ticket!

   16. Rick McDaniel
       I have zero intention of listening to candidates for the next 4
       yrs. , no matter who they are. One year is long enough to listen to
       liars...........and all of them are liars, no matter who they are.

       I like joe but we need a new fresh face i think mrs clinton and mrs
