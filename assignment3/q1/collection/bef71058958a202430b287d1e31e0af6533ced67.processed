Annual Letter: Excellence in Teaching

     How to improve education? In this excerpt from my 2011 letter as
     co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, I advocate for
     innovation, online tools, rewarding great teachers and helping good
     ones become great.

   In the United States, the foundation's biggest investments are in
   education. Only a third of students are graduating from high school
   prepared to succeed at college-level work, and even fewer are going on
   to get a degree that will help them compete for a good job. No one
   should feel comfortable with those results.
   Davis Guggenheim's amazing and popular movie "Waiting for Superman"
   made a powerful argument against the status quo. It showed a broad
   audience that schools with the right approach can succeed, even with
   inner city students that typical schools do not educate well. As more
   people understand the gap between what is possible and what is actually
   happening in most schools, I believe the momentum for reform will grow.
   Since 1980 U.S. government spending per K-12 student increased by 73
   percent, which is 20 percent faster than the rest of the economy. Over
   that time our achievement levels were basically flat, while other
   countries caught up. A recent analysis by the Programme for
   International Student Assessment (PISA) showed the United States is
   about average (compared to 35 developed countries) in science and
   reading and below average in math. Many Americans have a hard time
   believing this data, since we are so used to being the global leader in
   educational achievement and since we spend a lot more money on
   education than many other countries.
   PISA measured educational achievement in the Shanghai area of China,
   and even allowing for the fact that Shanghai is one of the most
   advanced parts of China, the scores relative to the United States and
   other countries were quite stunning. China did better in math, science,
   and reading than any of the 65 countries it was compared to, and it
   achieved these results with an average class size of more than 35
   students. One of the impressive things about the Chinese system is how
   teachers are measured according to their ability. There are four levels
   of proficiency in the Chinese system, and to move up a level, teachers
   have to demonstrate their excellence in front of a panel of reviewers.
   According to the [15]PISA analysis, two key things differentiate the
   U.S. education system from most other countries' systems. The first is
   that non-U.S. students are in school for more hours, and the second is
   that U.S. school systems do very little to measure, invest in, and
   reward teacher excellence.
   Most people who become teachers do so because they're passionate about
   kids. It's astonishing what great teachers can do for their students.
   But the remarkable thing about great teachers today is that in most
   cases nobody taught them how to be great. They figured it out on their
   own. That's why our foundation is investing to help devise measurement
   and support systems to help good teachers become great teachers.
   Our project to learn what the best teachers do--and how to share this
   information with other teachers--is making significant progress. With
   the help of local union affiliates, we have learned a lot already.
   We're learning that listening to students can be an important element
   in the feedback system. In classes where students agree that "Our class
   stays busy and doesn't waste time" or that "In this class, we learn a
   lot almost every day," there tend to be bigger achievement gains.
   Another great tool is taking a video showing both the teacher and the
   students and asking evaluators to provide feedback. Melinda and I spent
   several days visiting schools in Tennessee this fall and sat with
   teachers who were watching videos of themselves teaching. We heard from
   a number of them how they had already improved by seeing when students
   were losing interest and analyzing the reasons.
   Ultimately, the goal is to gather high-quality feedback from multiple
   sources--test scores, student surveys, videos, principals, and fellow
   teachers--so that teachers know how to improve. I think it is clear
   that a system can be designed that teachers agree is fair, has modest
   overhead, and rewards the teachers who are doing the most for their
   students.
   State budgets, the biggest part of K-12 funding, will be challenged in
   the years ahead because of the economic downturn, the liabilities from
   early retirement and pension commitments, and increasing medical costs.
   I recently gave a [16]speech to the chief state school officers about
   how they might need to find money to reward excellent teaching by
   shifting some away from things like payment for seniority or advanced
   degrees that do not correlate with improved teaching.
   I am very enthusiastic about the potential of innovation to help solve
   many of the problems with our education system. Melinda and I were
   impressed when we visited the Tennessee Technology Center in Nashville,
   an institution that provides young adults with technical training and
   certificates. It gets significantly better results than its peer
   institutions--graduating 71 percent of its students--because it focuses
   on teaching job skills that are in high demand and is oriented around
   meeting the needs of students who are juggling school with work and
   family. Sometimes something as simple as rethinking the times when
   classes are scheduled makes a huge difference for students.
   The foundation is funding the development of online tools to help both
   K-12 and college students learn. Pioneers like Sal Khan are already
   showing how effective online tools can be. His
   website [17]www.khanacademy.org continues to grow its library of 2,000
   short instructional videos on topics from basic arithmetic to
   complicated subjects like biology and physics. The videos are a
   tremendous resource for students of any age.
   Sal's vision for how technology can improve learning is broader than
   just videos. With support from the foundation, he's been able to expand
   his site to include online exercises that diagnose weak spots, pointing
   you to additional material to fill the gaps in your knowledge. Also,
   Khan Academy is creating an online "dashboard" to help teachers use the
   site as part of their curriculum. The dashboard tells the teacher how
   each student is doing, pinpoints where they're having trouble, and
   suggests explanations and exercises to help.
   Although it is clear that online learning works for strongly motivated
   students, we need to learn how to blend classroom learning and online
   learning, particularly for younger and less-prepared students. As these
   projects develop and we start to answer many of these questions, I
   believe technology will let us dramatically improve education despite
   the budget constraints.
