   [Updated at 12:12 p.m. ET] It's the end of a busy morning of momentous
   rulings from the Supreme Court. We're still working on getting analysis
   on and reaction to the two landmark decisions that will impact marriage
   between same-sex couples in the United States and we'll bring that to
   you on CNN.com, CNN's mobile apps and CNN TV.

   We'll sign off this live blog now, thanks for reading. Here are links
   to more of the coverage we already have:

   [Updated at 11:49 a.m. ET] Religion and marriage are intricately tied
   together for many and our Belief blog co-editor Daniel Burke has got a
   [101]range of reaction from believers and non-believers.

   Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is one of those looking at the
   decisions through a religion lens:

     5 people in robes said they are bigger than the voters of CA and
     Congress combined.And bigger than God.May He forgive us all.
     --
     Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) [102]June 26, 2013

   [Updated at 11:43 a.m. ET] Both the decisions affecting same-sex
   marriage were 5-4 splits. And the dissenting justices put out some
   strong opinions of their own.

   Justice Scalia on the DOMA case:

     Few public controversies touch an institution so central to the
     lives of so many, and few inspire such attendant passion by good
     people on both sides. Few public controversies will ever demonstrate
     so vividly the beauty of what our Framers gave us, a gift the Court
     pawns today to buy its stolen moment in the spotlight: a system of
     government that permits us to rule ourselves.

     Some will rejoice in today's decision, and some will despair at it;
     that is the nature of a controversy that matters to much to so many.
     But the Court has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an
     honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair
     defeat. We owed both of them better. I dissent.

   Justice Kennedy on the Proposition 8 case:

     What the Court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the
     initiative process. And it is this. The essence of democracy is that
     the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the
     government, not the other way around. Freedom resides first in the
     people without need of a grant from government. The California
     initiative process embodies these principles and has done so for
     over a century... In California and the 26 other States that permit
     initiatives and popular referendums, the people have exercised their
     own inherent sovereign right to govern themselves. The Court today
     frustrates that choice.

   [Updated at 11:35 a.m. ET] Kris Perry, one of the key figures in the
   Proposition 8 case, said it was a victory not just for couples wanting
   to wed but also children. "No matter where you live, no matter who your
   parents are, no matter what kind of family you're in, you are equal,
   you are as good as your friends' parents and your friends."

   She added: "We can go back to California and say to our own children -
   all four of our boys - your family is just as good as everybody else's
   family."

   [Updated at 11:20 a.m. ET] There are a lot of rainbow flags flying
   today. Including on Google if you search "gay."

   [Updated at 11:11 a.m. ET] [104]Family Research Council president Tony
   Perkins released a statement saying his group was "disappointed" in the
   DOMA ruling and "disturbed" by the detail of the Proposition 8 decision
   but that it also took some heart from the Supreme Court's actions.

   "Their refusal to redefine marriage for all states is a major setback
   for those seeking to redefine natural marriage," he said. "Time is not
   on the side of those seeking to create same-sex `marriage.' As the
   American people are given time to experience the actual consequences of
   redefining marriage, the public debate and opposition to the
   redefinition of natural marriage will undoubtedly intensify."

   He concluded: "What is inevitable is that the male and female
   relationship will continue to be uniquely important to the future of
   society. The reality is that society needs children, and children need
   a mom and a dad. We will continue to work to restore and promote a
   healthy marriage culture, which will maximize the chances of a child
   being raised by a married mother and father."

   [Updated at 11:08 a.m. ET] The Human Rights Campaign, which has pushed
   for LGBT equality, is declaring two "monumental victories." [105]Here's
   the top of their statement:

     In recent years, California's Proposition 8 and the discriminatory
     Defense of Marriage Act became symbols of anti-LGBT discrimination
     around the country and around the world. Today, both crumbled.
     In a watershed moment in the fight for equality, the United States
     Supreme Court today ruled to return marriage equality to California
     and to strike down DOMA. The court ruled in the Prop 8 case on
     procedural grounds, not reaching a decision on the merits of Prop 8
     or the broader question of whether the Constitution guarantees the
     fundamental right to marry the person you love.
     Marriages in California are expected to begin again soon. While a
     joyous milestone, these victories nonetheless throw into sharp
     relief the uneven progress for LGBT people around the country--a
     landscape where states like California are rapidly advancing toward
     equality, but progress in many other places remains stagnant.

   [Updated at 11:05 a.m. ET] A little more detail on exactly what the
   Proposition 8 decision by the Supreme Court means: By dismissing the
   case, the decision will allow for the lower court decision in
   California that allows for same-sex marriage to be reinstated. The
   appeals court stay on the decision will be lifted.

   [Updated at 10:59 a.m. ET] Here's what Hollywood is saying - some
   reactions from celebrities, many of whom have campaigned for gay
   rights.

     Remember the old days when [106]#DOMA was around and gay people

   And this is [116]George Takei on Facebook:

     Today marks a watershed moment in history and a tremendous victory
     for the principle of equality. The 5-4 decision by our Supreme Court
     striking down DOMA affirms the universality of love-the desire of
     all people not only to find, but to value and affirm, a lifelong
     commitment to another person.

     I have lived nearly four score years, and have borne witness to both
     the heartbreak and promise of true justice and equality in America.
     Today my heart soars, and my faith in the promise of our great
     nation is renewed.

     Now, if there's anything we gays know how to do well, it is to
     celebrate! Let the joy of this day ring out with PRIDE.

   [Updated at 10:47 a.m. ET] The key couples in the California case just
   held their arms aloft in celebration on the steps of the Supreme Court
   building. "This is a great day for America," said one of their lawyers,
   David Boies.

   [Updated at 10:46 a.m. ET] So [118]what's your reaction to the rulings
   today?

   [Updated at 10:38 a.m. ET] It sounds like we'll be looking into these
   rulings for a while - Jeffrey Toobin just said the Proposition 8 case
   was "a puzzling decision" and a "puzzling" line-up of justices who
   backed the decision.

   [119]The opinion about Proposition 8 was written by Chief Justice
   Roberts who was joined by Justice Scalia, a conservative, and three
   liberals - Justices Breyer, Ginsburg and Kagan.

   [Updated at 10:35 a.m. ET] Same-sex marriage can resume in California -
   that's the result of the Supreme Court ruling just in that dismisses an
   appeal regarding California's Proposition 8.

   From our colleague Bill Mears:

     The Supreme Court has dismissed a closely-watched appeal over
     same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds, ruling Wednesday
     private parties do not have "standing" to defend California's
     voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbians couples from
     state-sanctioned wedlock. The ruling permits same-sex couples in
     California to legally marry. The 5-4 decision avoids for now a
     sweeping conclusion on whether same-sex marriage is a
     constitutionally-protected "equal protection" right that would apply
     to all states. The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry (12-144).

   [Updated at 10:30 a.m. ET] New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman
   told CNN the ruling was a "great win." ""A great win not just for the
   gay community, it's a great win for the American tradition of equal
   justice under the law," he said.

   [Updated at 10:29 a.m. ET] House Speaker John Boehner was just asked
   about the DOMA case, but he declined comment until he's read the
   ruling.

   [Updated at 10:26 a.m. ET] The ruling on Proposition 8 - California's
   ban on same-sex marriage - is in.

   [Updated at 10:23 a.m. ET] And yes, the president was watching. His
   Twitter account is calling the DOMA ruling "a historic step forward,"
   though it's not signed with the "bo" that shows he wrote it.

   [Updated at 10:22 a.m. ET] President Obama was going to be monitoring
   the rulings on Air Force One as he heads to Senegal, CNN's Jessica
   Yellin reports.

   [Updated at 10:17 a.m. ET] Supporters of same-sex marriage waiting
   outside the Supreme Court cheered the DOMA decision. Reaction is also
   coming in from Twitter.

   DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that "finally" all married
   couples would get benefits.

     Finally, married couples will enjoy the federal benefits and
     protections they've been denied for years. [124]#DOMA [125]#SCOTUS

     D Wasserman Schultz (@DWStweets) [126]June 26, 2013

   [Updated at 10:15 a.m. ET] Of course we can't draw any conclusions from
   the DOMA ruling about which way the justices will decide on
   California's Proposition 8.

   [Updated at 10:12 a.m. ET] The justices were split 5-4. The majority
   ruling was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Dissents were written by
   Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Samuel
   Alito.

   [Updated at 10:09 a.m. ET] Legal expert Jeffrey Toobin puts the ruling
   in context: "DOMA is gone."

   [Updated at 10:08 a.m. ET] From our team in Washington:

     The Supreme Court has struck down a key provision of the Defense of
     Marriage Act, ruling that same-sex spouses legally married in a
     state may receive federal benefits.

   [Updated at 10:06 a.m. ET] This is the case where Edie Windsor said she
   had to pay more in inheritance tax than warranted because her spouse
   was a woman not a man.

   [Updated at 10:02 a.m. ET] We're reading [128]the decision to see how
   the justices ruled regarding the rights of legally married same-sex
   couples to receive federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses.

   [Updated at 10:01 a.m. ET] There is a ruling in the DOMA case.

   [Updated at 10:00 a.m. ET] So it's 10 a.m. in the nation's capital and
   [129]the Supreme Court should be sitting. No cameras inside the court
   of course, so we can only assume they are good timekeepers.

   [Updated at 9:54 a.m. ET] Two days ago Lady Gaga called on the Supreme
   Court to "make history & stand for MARRIAGE EQUALITY." That's now been
   retweeted nearly 14,000 times. But will it have had any impact on the
   nine justices?

   [Updated at 9:50 a.m. ET] Here are some of the people who weren't
   specifically part of the cases argued before the Supreme Court but who
   will almost certainly be affected by the rulings. CNN's [133]Moni Basu
   profiled gay couples who are at the center of two big political debates
   - same-sex marriage and immigration.

   [Updated at 9:44 a.m. ET] While we're waiting for the opinions to be
   delivered, [134]here's Donna Brazile's take on yesterday's landmark
   ruling on the Voting Rights Act. The Democratic strategist says it's
   time for President Obama and Congress to pass a new Voting Rights Act.

   [Updated at 9: 40 a.m. ET] A quick reminder that you can watch our
   reporting live on CNN TV as well as refreshing this page and staying
   with CNN on CNN.com and our mobile apps.

   [Updated at 9:19 a.m. ET] Large crowds are gathering outside the
   Supreme Court in Washington D.C. and on social media. Right now we can
   see rainbow gay pride banners and blue flags with a yellow "=" sign
   that is a standard of those fighting for more rights for same-sex
   couples. Not in view are groups who support traditional marriage
   between a man and a woman, but that's not to say they're not there.
   Both sides were strongly represented when the Supreme Court heard the
   arguments back in March.

   On Twitter, #DOMA will probably start trending soon. There's certainly
   a lot of people tweeting about the Supreme Court today.

   The Tie the Knot organization that wants marriage equality tweeted "The
   big day is here."

   [Posted at 9:05 a.m. ET] It's set to be the last public day of the
   Supreme Court session, and we're waiting for opinions in three cases -
   two of which address same-sex marriage.

   It's widely expected that we'll get rulings on the federal Defense of
   Marriage Act (DOMA) and California's Proposition 8, and those rulings
   could affect the lives, rights and finances of millions of Americans.

   CNN Supreme Court producer Bill Mears writes that DOMA, passed in 1996,
   [145]defines marriage as between one man and one woman for federal
   purposes, like taxes. "That means the estimated 120,000 gay and lesbian
   couples legally married in nine states and the District of Columbia are
   still considered - in the eyes of DOMA opponents - the equivalent of
   girlfriend and boyfriend."

   That meant that [146]Edie Windsor faced a hefty bill for inheritance
   taxes when her partner of 42 years died. She claimed in court that she
   had had to pay $363,053 more than if her spouse, thea Spyer, had been a
   man.

   But Mears points out that the DOMA issue is more than just a financial
   question:

     The larger debate over DOMA's intent and impact 17 years after
     passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative
     branches.

     At issue is what role the federal government should play when it
     comes to marriage - something states have traditionally controlled.

   The other key case expected to be decided today considers Proposition
   8. "In the 'Prop 8' case, the high court is being asked to establish a
   constitutional 'equal protection' right. It is the kind of hot-button
   issue that will define our society, our laws, our views on family,"
   [147]Mears writes.

            gloves?

       This means spiritual death to where blood is yoyr conscience
       knowing and deeds. Leviticus 20. 13 If a man lies with a male as he
       lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They
       shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them.

            Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if
            I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear
            reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there
            some wiggle room here?

       Matthew 5:20For I say to you, that unless your
       righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and
       Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.

            Mathew 7 had a little verse about judging, planks in the eye,
            etc. Revisit that one.

            What makes you think I havent. Repentance of sin and
            havihaving a reality living in purity of Christ creations
            before reading the bible then it can be understood. Understand
            that one.

            Good. The measure in which you judge will be used to judge
            you. Ready for it?
