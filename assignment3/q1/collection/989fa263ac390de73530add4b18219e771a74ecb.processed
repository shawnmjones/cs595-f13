Arizona's Brewer plays hardball on Medicaid expansion

   Associated Press

   When it comes to governors embracing Affordable Care Act implementation
   and expanding Medicaid to help low-income families, we tend to think of
   progressive blue-state governors. There are several Republicans who've
   followed suit, but they've done so with great reluctance.

   But in an unexpected twist, it seems no governor is more enthusiastic
   about Medicaid expansion [3]than Arizona's Jan Brewer.

     Gov. Jan Brewer sent five bills to the scrap heap Thursday in a
     pointed gesture intended to prod lawmakers into a deal on the budget
     and her plan to expand Medicaid.

     The five vetoes, follow-through on Brewer's promise to block
     legislation until her top priorities move forward, capped a tense
     day that saw some lawmakers receive threats over their support for
     the plan to provide health care for more of the state's poor.
     In letters explaining her actions, Brewer revealed a growing
     impatience with the Legislature, which she noted has been in session
     for 130 days and has only five weeks until the constitutional
     deadline for a fiscal 2014 budget.

   It was surprising enough when Brewer [4]endorsed "Obamacare" expansion
   in January. Indeed, it caught much of the political world off-guard --
   the Arizona Republican has earned a reputation for being a very
   conservative opponent of President Obama and the White House's agenda.
   But on Medicaid, Brewer apparently did the math and concluded she'd be
   a fool to reject the Obama administration's offer.

   State House Republicans, at least so far, don't see it that way and
   have been willing to ignore her demands. Brewer, in turn, is playing
   hardball, telling the state legislature -- where there are Republican
   majorities in both chambers -- that she'll veto literally every bill
   that passes until lawmakers get Medicaid expansion done.

   GOP lawmakers apparently thought she was bluffing, and approved
   unrelated measures. As promised, Brewer vetoed the bills and reiterated
   her threat. The state Senate is already on board with the governor's
   position, but the state House remains opposed.

   And so arguably the biggest "Obamacare" implementation fight in the
   nation is underway in Arizona, where a conservative Republican governor
   is fighting her own allies. It's a dynamic that would have been hard to
   predict six months ago.

   When she discovered that her own house was on fire she opted to call
   the government financed fire department.

   It is called self preservation.

   And that's exactly it, Day. The expansion means something like $7.1
   billion poured into the state. The expansion would cover an additional
   approximately 238,000 people in a state that has dropped childless
   adults, transplant patients (some who have already died), and anyone
   else they could think of. The extra coverage will create jobs that will
   pay a bit more than WalMart, our current largest employer, and those
   aren't just more doctors and nurses by any means.

   Brewer suprised me by seeing the benefit in this, but whatever her
   reasoning, I hope she sticks with it. This is a state that consistently
   ranks at the bottom of the lists of anything you'd like to see thriving
   (e.g. good economy, low unemployment rate, adequate education funding,
   etc).

   As for the five bills she vetoed, they should have been vetoed even
   without this expansion, but being Arizona, likely would have been
   signed.

   The problem still lies with the elevated cost of drugs, hospital stays
   and basic procedures in America. As shown in this article, when
   compared to our peers, the cost of basic health care needs is still
   well in excess of most other nations:

   care-costs.html

   Basically, the problem is related to the profit motive behind health
   care.

   Amen Janice,

   Anything less than a single payer universal health care system is an
   insult to thinking people. Profit has no place in any health care
   system.

   You're right. She can do the math. I don't care for "Not Ready For
   Prime Time Jan" but you have to admire the fact that she is smart
   enough to figure out she has to speak the language the legislature will
   understand. As an aside, not everyone in Arizona is short sighted,
   selfish, and mean. Just a majority of those who vote here regularly.

   Jan Brewer has backed Racism, Homophobia, Misogyny, Xenophobia, etc.
   and the best you can come up with is that she is unattractive?

   You should be ashamed.

   This won't keep her from blaming Medicaid for being a horrible thing
   and the administration being out of their minds by passing it, and then
   denying that she ever endorsed it whenever she has a primary coming up
   or whenever she is running for whatever other office.

   And CNN will report a "controversy on Brewer's previous position on
   this subject". You know, you always need to see both sides of the
   "argument".

   While that's likely true, Brewer can sometimes show a glimmer of common
   sense. She seems very much driven by the polls, not necessarily the
   party base. (And make no mistake about it, I am NOT a Brewer fan by any
   measure!)

   There were, for example, several bills even worse than SB1070 that she
   vetoed, and all, if memory serves me correctly, were introduced by now
   disgraced and recalled Senate President Russell Pearce. And that was
   when he was riding high on the power train, but just before the recall
   occurred.

   She also vetoed the bill that would require all presidential candidates
   to show their long form birth certificate, although circumsion
   certificates could be substituted for the birth certificate. Seriously.
   That was the bill. As Brewer said: "That's a bridge too far." When you
   realize Arizona stopped issuing a long form birth certificate in 1989,
   it does make one wonder....

   Yeah, we got lots of legislators to be 'proud' of here in Arizona. :}
   (Voters too, BTW.)

   In no way is this redemption for Brewer's financial cutbacks on
   healthcare in the past which denied care and resulted in the death(s)

   Arizonans are getting ready for some house cleaning next election.
   RINOs are driving Republicans out of our party, not our conservative
   values.

   Remember, it was with a Republican Governor, a Republican Senate and a
   Republican House that we had Obamacare shoved down our throats.

   We have a lot of Cotton in Arizona and we also have a lot of print
   shops looking for work. So bring it on RINOs, we will make ya famous!
   Let it be a warning to all who plan to run on the R ticket, we will not
   get punked again. Jan Brewer and John McComish are already listed,
   Heather Carter Bob Robson, Jeff Dial, Steve [88]Mike Pierce Frank Pratt
   are already printed and will be listed soon.
