   Everyone at the apartment of Roberta Kaplan, the lawyer who argued
   Edith Windsor's successful challenge
   to the Defense of Marriage Act, exploded in screams and sobs when the
   ruling came down. Kaplan called her mother and said, "Total victory,
   Mom: it couldn't be better." Windsor said, "I wanna go to Stonewall
   right now!" Then she called a friend and said, "Please get married
   right away!"

   Update: Just after 11 A.M., the President called. Kaplan picked up the
   phone and gave it to Windsor. "Hello, who am I talking to?" Windsor
   said. "Oh, Barack Obama? I wanted to thank you. I think your coming out
   for us made such a difference throughout the country."
