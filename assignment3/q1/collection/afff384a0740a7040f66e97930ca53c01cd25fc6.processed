Chronicling Mitt's Mendacity, Vol. XXXVI

   When Mitt Romney talked to "60 Minutes" last week, he said President
   Obama has "repeatedly shown a reckless disregard for the truth." If
   there's ever been a more blatant example of political "[3]projection,"
   I can't think of it.

   And yet, Romney is increasingly invested in this. This week, several
   reports noted that Romney intends to use next week's debate to "[4]fact
   check" the president. The Obama campaign, unimpressed, released a video
   this morning on the subject.

   Of course, if the 2012 presidential race comes down to which candidate
   is more dishonest, Romney's in trouble. Consider, for example, the 36th
   installment of my weekly series, chronicling Mitt's mendacity.

   1. Romney argued just yesterday that the crisis of military suicides
   [7]would be made worse by looming cuts to the defense budget.

   [8]That's plainly untrue.

   2. In same speech, Romney said, "You realize we have fewer ships in the
   Navy than any time since 1917."

   This one again? Romney dropped [9]this lie a while ago, but it's
   apparently back.

   3. Romney went on to say, in reference to the president, "[H]is plan
   also calls for trillion dollar deficits."

   Obama's plan calls for [10]trillions in deficit reduction.

   4. Romney added, "It is the same series of policies he's put in place
   over the last four years and they have not worked. And if you don't,
   why, look at the price of gasoline."

   To blame gas prices on the president's policies is [11]ridiculously
   untrue.

   5. Romney also said in reference to Obama, "He's put us on a road to
   Europe."

   The irony is, Europe is trying to grow through austerity, just as
   Romney intends to do here. He's lying in a self-refuting sort of way.

   6. In a speech at Westerville, Ohio, Romney boasted, "We got
   unemployment down [in Massachusetts] to 4.7 percent."

   Well, in reality, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts dropped
   because so many people dropped out of the state's workforce. The fact
   of the matter is Massachusetts' job creation record during Romney's
   term was "[12]one of the worst in the country," ranking [13]47th out of
   50 states.
     __________________________________________________________________

   7. In the same speech, Romney argued, "Now we have a president who the
   other day says something quite revealing. He said he can't change
   Washington from the inside. Only from the outside."

   That's [14]not what Obama said.

   8. Romney added, "Obamacare is point number one. It's the example
   number one, where he wants to put bureaucrats between you and your
   doctor."

   There's nothing in the Affordable Care Act that does this. Maybe Romney
   is thinking of [15]his pal, Virginia Gov. Bob "Ultrasound" McDonnell?

   9. Romney also said, "He believes that government should have a board
   of people that tell you what kind of care you could receive."

   Romney's trying to describe the Independent Payment Advisory Board
   (IPAB), but he's doing so in a way that's [16]completely dishonest.

   10. In a minute-long ad, Romney said, "My plan will create 12 million
   new jobs over the next four years."

   Putting aside the pesky detail that Romney doesn't actually have a
   specific jobs plan, the fact remains that if we do nothing, we're on
   track to [17]create 12 million new American jobs over the next four
   years anyway.

   11. Romney [18]told ABC News this week, "[M]ine is a campaign about
   100% of the people, not 99 and 1, not any other percent."

   I seem to recall [19]watching a video in which Romney said it's not his
   "job" to "worry about" 47 percent of the population.

   12. In an interview with CNN, Romney said, "[C]rippling sanctions [on
   Iran] ... These are the types of things that the president could have
   done, should have done from the very beginning, which he did not."

   [20]Yes, he did.

   13. Asked about his own dishonest ads, Romney said, "We've been
   absolutely spot-on. And any time there's anything that's been a miss we
   correct it or remove it."

   [21]You've got to be kidding me.

   14. Romney also argued, "Look, it has been shown time and again that
   the president's effort to take work requirement out of welfare is a
   calculated move."

   This continues to be [22]as obvious a lie as Romney has told all year.

   15. Romney added, "The requirement that they're waiving was saying that
   people don't have to work to get welfare. That's the change that they
   proposed."

   [23]Still lying.

   16. Romney said in an ABC interview, "And of course also on 60 Minutes
   he laid out his economic agenda saying things are going just fine."

   [24]Obama never said that.

   17. At a campaign event in Ohio, Romney said on Obama, "He's going to
   bring the deficit down. Of course, he didn't. He doubled it."

   Maybe Romney doesn't know what "double" means. The deficit on Obama's
   first day was $1.3 trillion. Last year, it was also $1.3 trillion. This
   year, it's projected to be $1.1 trillion. When he says the president
   "more than doubled" the deficit, as he has many times, Romney's lying.

   18. In the same speech, Romney added, "[D]o you know how much money
   he's spent in one year putting money into companies that he thought had
   a bright future, green companies? He spent $90 billion! $90 billion!"

   The details matter: much of the $90 billion was appropriated by George
   W. Bush, not Obama.
   19. Romney also argued, "This president persists on the road of making
   it harder and harder for small businesses to grow and thrive."

   Actually, the administration has [25]done the opposite.

   20. Romney went on to say, "This president has a plan for small
   business. He's got a plan for small business. He's going to raise their
   taxes!"

   In reality, Obama has repeatedly cut taxes on small businesses -- by
   some counts, 18 times -- and if given a second term, his tax plan would
   have no effect [26]on 97% of small businesses.

   21. On a conference call with a group of Iowans, Romney [27]argued,
   "Small business is getting crushed under the president's program ... by
   forcing people to join unions that don't want to. That's something
   known as card check."

   Card check didn't pass. It wouldn't crush small businesses anyway, but
   a law can't have any effect if it doesn't exist.

   22. In an interview with CBS, Romney defended himself against the
   flip-flop label. "The president has certainly changed his view on a
   whole host of things. He was going to close Guantanamo."

   Obama's views on Guantanamo didn't change; Congress intervened to keep
   the detention facility open.

   23. Romney added, in reference to voters looking for details, "Well, I
   can tell them specifically what my policy looks like. I will not raise
   taxes on middle income folks."

   There's ample evidence that Romney [28]will raise taxes on the middle
   class.

   24. Asked about what spending he'd cut to balance the budget, Romney
   said, "The first big one is I'm not going to go forward with Obamacare.
   I will repeal Obamacare. It costs about $100 billion a year."

   That's the [29]exact opposite of the truth. The Affordable Care Act
   saves the country hundreds of billions of dollars. If Romney repeals
   it, the deficit goes up, not down.

   25. Romney added, "I don't want any change to Medicare for current
   seniors or for those that are nearing retirement. So the plan stays
   exactly the same"

   That's [30]demonstrably wrong. Under Romney's policy, the cost of
   prescription drug prices and preventive care for seniors would go up
   immediately -- for current and future retirees.

   26. Romney also said, "The president's cutting $716 billion from
   current Medicare. I disagree with that."

   [31]Sigh.

   27. Romney argued, "I'm going to look at every federal program and I'll
   ask this question, 'Is this program so critical it's worth borrowing
   money from China to pay for it?'"

   The implication here is that U.S. debt is financed by the Chinese, but
   this isn't true -- China only holds [32]about 8% of the nation's debt.

   28. Romney went on to say in reference to the president, "His challenge
   with blaming it on the Republican Congress is of course that for his
   first two years, right now the majority of his term, he had a Democrat
   Congress, a super majority in the Democrat Congress."

   The Senate supermajority lasted four months, [33]not two years.

   29. In his weekly podcast, Romney said, "As many of the original
   proponents of welfare reform have made clear, the Obama
   Administration's actions were not in keeping with the spirit or the
   letter of the law."

   As [34]many of the original proponents of welfare reform have made
   clear, Romney's lying.

   30. He added, "My five-point plan will deliver the economic recovery
   we've all been waiting for."

   The five-point plan [35]is a sham, and to pretend otherwise is
   dishonest.

   31. At an event in Las Vegas, Romney said of Obama, "This
   redistribution idea, this redistribution idea has been tried in other
   places. This is not a new idea. It's just never worked in other places.
   And it's certainly not going to work here."

   As falsehoods go, [36]this is just dumb.

   32. In the same speech, Romney argued, "I don't want to have a
   government getting bigger and bigger, more intrusive, telling us what
   kind of health insurance we have to have."

   As Romney surely knows -- his state-based policy works the same way --
   the whole point of the Affordable Care Act is to provide consumers with
   choices of private plans, made available through regulated exchanges.
   Giving people choices and telling people "what kind of health insurance
   we have to have" are opposites.

   33. At an event in Florida, Romney said, "We can't keep spending a
   trillion dollars more than we take in every year or we will be Greece
   at some point."

   This is [37]painfully untrue.

   34. In the same speech, Romney promised, "I'll get America on track to
   have a balanced budget."

   No, he won't. Romney says his plan "[38]can't be scored," but
   independent budget analysts have found his agenda would [39]make the
   deficit bigger, not smaller, and add trillions to the national debt.

   35. Romney added, "I think a lot of us were really surprised when the
   President in Roanoke, Virginia a few weeks ago, he stood up and said,
   'If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Someone else did
   that.'"

   That's [40]not even close to what the president said.

   36. Romney went on to say, "I will never apologize for American
   abroad."

   How is it possible the [41]whole "apology" lie hasn't gone away yet?

   37. Romney also argued, "One more thing this president has proposed,
   and that is the combination of the sequential idea come from the White
   House which is cutting our military by hundreds of billions of dollars
   in its own budget, which cutting our military by hundreds of billions
   of dollars, he would have cut a trillion dollars by this decade."

   That's two falsehoods in one. First, the sequester would cut about $500
   billion from the military budget, not $1 trillion. Second, Romney's not
   only lying, he's also condemning defense cuts crafted by [42]his own
   party and endorsed by his own running mate.

   I loved the one where the CNN reporter asked him about the ads with the
   "welfare lie" and would he change them, to which he answered "Of course
   we have...." and then proceeded to make the welfare lie again to the
   reporter's face.

   I just really really want to know how come JFK, MLK and RFK get killed,
   and guys like Rove, Cheney and Romney are still walking around.

   Romney has no idea what empathy is... he traveled to China and toured
   this factory that had despicable living quarters, appalling work hours,
   and shameful wages for these human beings. And yet they went ahead and
   invested in this company. How can anybody invest in a company that
   treats humans like his dog on top of his car. I 'm not sure why this
   does not concern many of these far right people, only God knows this,
   but this kind of thinking needs to stop. Knowing that people are
   treated this way and buy this company just to get a profit is so
   inconceivably shallow and disrespectful towards those workers. Romney
   only has compassion for the people that is in his circle, everybody
   else outside the circle needs to kiss his ring because he even said
   that being powerful and rich is Great! All human beings deserve
   compassion and respect. Not Power! President Obama has that compassion
   and respect for all people and I'm honored that he is our POTUS!

   Compassion, Who do you think built the computer your typing on, a Union
   Worker making 150K in pay, benefits and a pension plan. How about the
   clothes or shoes you buy? Surely you couldn't be supporting companies
   in third world countries that pay slave wages and have no benefits.
   Where do you think the steel used in the construction of your car,
   refrigerator, washing machine, etc... came from? How about your TV set,
   radio, air conditioning, etc.... who do you think built them? Do you
   really think every thing you consume is the result of companies paying
   what you would call a "Living Wage". You and millions of Americans reap
   the benefits of what you suggest is appalling. And then you point a
   damming finger at Romney. Have you ever considered those wages and
   living conditions are better than starving in the street. Do you know
   that the average woman in third world countries takes four trips a day
   just to get water for her family? Do you know anything about third
   world countries and the daily struggle to simply survive another day?
   Have you ever wondered what the impacts would be on these people if
   they had no opportunity for work, regardless of the conditions or
   compensation? There is no doubt Romney's motivation was profit, but a
   side affect of his investment was food on someones table. Living in
   American with all the available Government Handouts, it is doubtful you
   have any idea about what a job like that means to a person in a third
   world country. It may very well be the difference between life and
   death. So Mr. Compassionate, stop buying those products, live without
   them, and send the money you save to the people you are so concerned
   about. Or are you simply attacking Romney and could really careless
   about the third world labor force used and abused to ensure your
   standard of living is maintained?

   As for Obama, he has so much respect and compassion for people he has
   taken millions from the Middle Class to Poverty right here in the Good
   Old USA. Wake up. Its time for a Change.

   A man who wants to be pres of the biggest country in the free world
   should try & set an example for other countries who constantly watch
   what we do. By him buying that company, knowing the conditions the
   workers have to deal with to survive, merely indicates that he is a
   heartless American who only believes in money, money, money. He is a
   business man, & not pres material. He's treating the bid for pres like
   a business transaction, not like a leader. Since he seems to think
   those factory wrkrs are happy with their lives, it's no wonder he
   doesn't care about 47% of America's population. Pay attention to the
   fact that conditions for those factory wkrs are ok with him, because if
   he ends up in the white house, we may be next.

   erbajean, this reminds me Tom Delay stating the Marianas Island being
   the ideal petri dish for capitalism. That IS what these types covet. No
   laws about working conditions, low wages, the ability to threaten the
   workers with "losing this great job" that people would "break in" to
   obtain.

   the amount of times they've been caught not merely spinning, but out
   and out lying with deceptive edits. They did it with the Tea Party,
   they did it in the Trayvon Martin case, Andrea Mitchell (Mrs Greenspan)
   did it with the `Wawa' lie, just to name a few. The latest one takes
   the cake - even the NYT & HuffPo have corrected it. MSNBC? Still
   running with the lie!

   The character of Mitt Romney will show up against Obama. NBC and the
   the lib press will continue to lie, Dem load their polls and try to
   convince everyone that the race is over. They did the same in 2010 and

   Name a lie that Maddow has told that prompts you to make this post.
   What "one" are you talking about? The welfare for work issue or the
   reduction in the US military? I have no idea what you're referencing so
   I have no idea what it is you're referring.

   For the record:

   -The George Zimmerman tape that you're referring to was only edited on
   one program one time and that was to omit the operator asking the race
   of the individual. No one on the show made the implication that
   Zimmerman was racist nor were they arguing that he was racist. This
   assumption is being made on behalf of the conservative wing. The rest
   of us realized that this was simple editing. I'll grant you in
   retrospect probably stupid editing, but it isn't a violation of truth
   to edit content for time as long as context isn't taken out. The
   scenario they were talking about- which was the phone call made by
   Zimmerman- did not warrant that this one sentence be imperative to
   understanding. Leave it to a conservative to spin that this being left
   out was an egregious affront to information. And leave it to a
   conservative to play the "I'm rubber you're glue" game by blaming other
   people for the thing he is doing.

   -What lies have MSNBC told about the Tea Party?

   -What is the "wawa" lie and how was it a lie and when did she do it?

   What did they do in 2010? The polls showed that the Republican Party
   were going to have huge victories and that was reported as much here on
   TRMS. So what polls are you referring to? How does one load a poll and
   what proof do you have that NBC is doing this?

   audience of nothing but factcheckers. I have never in my 70 years known
   anyone that lies or just messes up when he talks like Romney, except
   maybe one.............the last Bush. I don't think Bush was even dumb
   enough to say they need to be able to open windows in an airplane. lol

   [215]http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/us/politics/in-virginia-obama-an
   d-romney-reach-out-to-military.html?_r=0

Published: September 27, 2012

   VIRGINIA BEACH -- In case anyone is wondering, Virginia is up for grabs
   this election. So, with 39 days to go, [216]President Obama and
   [217]Mitt Romney dueled in the commonwealth on Thursday, both trying to
   lock up support from voters with ties to the military.

   I still believe in you!" President Obama yelled out at the sea of
   white, brown and black faces gathered before him at Farm Bureau Live,
   an outdoor amphitheater in this naval town. "If you stand with me and
   work with me, we'll win the Tidewater again. We'll win Virginia again."

   How's it going, Virginia Beach?" Mr. Obama shouted into the microphone.
   He quickly attached himself to Senator Jim Webb, the retired Marine who
   had introduced him in a lengthy windup that trumpeted the president's
   support for military families. "I could not be prouder of a man who has
   served his country his entire life, as a Marine, as a secretary of the
   Navy," the president said of Mr. Webb, who is not seeking re-election.

   The crowd ate it up, especially as they were primed beforehand by the
   cast of colorful characters that make up Virginia Democratic politics.
   Representative Robert C. Scott, sporting an accent straight out of
   "Dukes of Hazzard," seemed a particular favorite. He drew roars when he
   recounted how in 2008, CNN called Virginia for Obama for the first
   Democratic presidential win here in 40 years, and then, "two minutes
   later," called the election for Mr. Obama. It was a story meant to
   demonstrate how central winning the state has become to American
   presidential aspirations.

   s[230]alvatore babones at truthout notes this fun fact found sorting
   thru rmoney's economic plan:

   The final component of Romney's "plan for jobs and economic growth"
   deals with energy policy. Romney plans to create 1,200,000 jobs by
   promoting offshore oil drilling in "the Gulf of Mexico, both the
   Atlantic and Pacific Outer Continental Shelves, Western lands, the
   Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and off the Alaska coast."

   Yes, Romney intends to create 1.2 million jobs through offshore oil
   drilling. That's the entire population of Dallas - offshore.

   Moody's Analytics' energy economist Chris Lafakis calculates that a
   high estimate of the "the number of jobs both directly and indirectly
   supported by the offshore
   industry" in the Gulf of Mexico is 62,500.

   Steve,

   While I applaud your tenacity, and your determination to see this right
   through to the election (I assume V more chapters) this is getting a
   bit repetitive.

   You've listed approximately 1000 lies by Mitt Romney already. But most
   of them are repeats. If he's got a lie in his stump speech, and he
   repeats it multiple times per week for months on end, is that one lie
   or dozens?

   To keep repeating the same lie over and over again, not ever admitting
   it's not true, so that a certain portion of the public believes it must
   be true, is their strategy. It is a bolder sort of lying than most
   politicians, but not otherwise remarkable.

   Perhaps you could re-organize your chapters into a list of lies--I'm
   guessing fewer than 100--and note when he started and if he ever
   stopped telling them. It will make the book easier to write.

   Republicans want to talk about women that are a little aggressive in
   politics as something bad. Now that is a good one, because what it
   really means is these Republicans are just showing how weak they really
   are. If a Republican man cannot handle the heat, then get out of
   politics, because you are really incapable of handling any political
   issues that matter to people. These Republican men's excuses again are
   trivia, when it comes to such important issues that are going on today.
   Republican men have now shown how weak they are and just give in to the
   extreme wealthy and extremists of hatred. It has been these Democrat
   women who have been speaking up for the people and not some corrupt
   Republican men playing games of nonsense, deceptions, and lies. The

   Somehow, it's the continuing spewing of nonsense about the size of the
   Navy that shows why this man is the most profoundly unqualified major
   party candidate for the presidency since Warren Harding.

   The U.S. Navy's battle fleet tonnage is greater than that of the next
   thirteen largest navies in the world, and eleven of those countries are
   our allies or partners. The only non-allied navy in the world that
   would be more than a minor nuisance would be China's, which might
   actually manage to hurt us before we obliterated it.

   And the problem is that I have seen absolutely no evidence that Mitt
   has sufficient understanding of military affairs to grasp the abyssal
   depths of ignorance he's disclosing. I have seen no evidence that he
   sees Navy ships as anything other than toys in the bathtub. It is
   horrifying that the GOP thinks it would be okay to put this idiot in
   proximity to the nuclear go-codes.

   At least Bush II spent a few months dressing up in a uniform and flying
   obsolete fighters before he deserted and thus had at least a passing
   familiarity with military technology.

   Romney is more suited to a psyche study than the Presidency.

   I've asked myself that same question, What is Romneys malfunction,
   since we learned about Seamus, the dog in the crate on the top of the
   car. What part of Romney is missing empathy? Is Romney a Sociopath? A
   Psychopath? ??

   OTOH the "roll down windows in an aircraft" statement shows Romney may
   simply be stupid, without a clue at the very least.

   Should we care?

   Should we try to determine if Romney is pathological or simply a
   dumbass?

   Or is it enough to know Romney is in some way pooched and to hell with
   exactly how and why Romneys pooched?

   When I smell poo I don't much care what animal it came from. It's
   enough to not step in it.

   to find Romney marching out of his own room ahead of a prep school
   posse shouting about their plan to cut Lauber's hair. Friedemann
   followed them to a nearby room where they came upon Lauber, tackled him
   and pinned him to the ground. As Lauber, his eyes filling with tears,
   screamed for help, Romney repeatedly clipped his hair with a pair of
   scissors.

   [372]Ref. Washington Post

   What would you call it?

   Poo not to be stepped in.

   Romney accuses the POTUS of not being truthful when he say's he
   (Romney) is against abortion in cases of rape,incest or the health of
   the mother.If I'm not mistaken when asked by Mike Huckabee if he would
   sign a personhood amendment if he were elected Pres.and it came across
   his desk, Romney replied, yes I would.A personhood amendment mean's no
   abortion for any reason, period.So who's lying Mr.Romney?

   Wouldn't he be playing for the 53? Or maybe go for a different metaphor
   and have the figure 47% "tattooed" on his forehead. Perhaps with a big
   fat "L" like a cattle brand. Nah, that'd be too much like the "Joker
   Obama" crap. Stick with the jersey idea.
