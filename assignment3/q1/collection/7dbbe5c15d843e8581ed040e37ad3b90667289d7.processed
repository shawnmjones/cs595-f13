Reconstructing the trail of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's deleted Instagram account

   By Erica Fink and Laurie Segall, CNN
   updated 10:55 AM EDT, Mon April 29, 2013 |
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Accused bomber had a little-known and now deleted Instagram account
     * Digital traces still remain of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's deleted post
     * Investigators are likely to look closely at the Instagram trail
     * One of Dzhokhar's friends says he "was the last person you'd expect
       to do this"

   (CNN) -- [41]Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Twitter account and VK Russian social
   networking profile have drawn heavy public scrutiny, but he left
   another, more hidden social media trail: a deleted Instagram account
   that sources close to him tell CNN once belonged to the accused Boston
   bomber.

   The Instagram account, with the user name "jmaister1," no longer
   exists, and friends of Tsarnaev's say it was deleted only recently. An
   Instagram spokesman declined to comment on the account or disclose when
   the account was deleted.

   CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem says the account could be
   significant.

   "If I were an investigator right now, obviously the platform he deleted
   matters the most," she said.

   Traces of the jmaister1 account were still visible this week in
   Google's Web cache and on other archiving sites. Digital sleuths often
   use those tools to find glimpses of deleted material.

   "It's exactly like an archive," tech entrepreneur and programmer Sam
   Altman explained. "So no matter what changes were made to the page
   today, on the current server, Google has this sort of imprint from a
   couple of weeks ago."

   Tsarnaev's complete account could not be recovered with those tools.
   Google's cache stores the pages it indexes for variable lengths of
   time: sometimes days, sometimes weeks.

   This image from the site Statigram shows an image that Dzhokhar
   Tsarnaev "liked" of warlord Shamil Basayev.

   The digital traces that remain show that Tsarnaev added a "like" on
   several photos referring to Chechnya that were posted by other
   Instagram users. One shows Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, a onetime
   government official who later masterminded terrorist attacks against
   Russia. Basayev was killed in 2006.

   Another pro-Chechnya image that Tsarnaev "liked" carries a string of
   hashtags including #FreeChechenia #Jihad #Jannah #ALLAH #Jesus and
   #God. An academic Chechnya expert whom CNN consulted said the images
   illustrated a familiarity with Chechen politics and iconography.
   Keeping major events safe post-Boston
   Did mother discuss jihad with son?

   Tsarnaev's Instagram account wasn't widely known; CNN spoke with
   several friends of his who said they were unaware of its existence. Two
   of his high-school classmates, however, spoke about the account and
   said he used it to keep in touch with a close-knit group of school
   friends.

   The two classmates say they are shocked by -- and in some cases
   skeptical of -- the charges being levied at the friend they knew as
   "Jahar." As one said, "Jahar was the last person you'd expect to do
   this. I've honestly never heard anybody say anything bad about him."

   Since Tsarnaev's account was deleted, little of what he wrote and
   posted remains publicly visible, but Kayyem expects investigators to
   take a closer look at whatever data they can reconstruct.

   "Were there clues embedded in the combination of images that can tell
   us something about what Dzhokhar was thinking?" she asked. "Some of
   those pictures are very benign. Some of them standing alone don't mean
   anything."

   Instagram makes clear in its terms of service that it will turn its
   records over to law enforcement officials when it receives a valid
   subpoena or search warrant.

   "Given the volume of real-time content on Instagram, some information
   may only be stored for a short period of time," Instagram says on its
   site. "We do not retain data for law enforcement purposes unless we
   receive a valid preservation request."
