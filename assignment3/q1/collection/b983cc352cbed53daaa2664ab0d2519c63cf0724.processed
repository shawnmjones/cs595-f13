[47]It's a Boy!!

   Update: It's a prince!! Duchess Catherine gave birth to a son
   yesterday, July 22nd, born at 4:24pm London time, weighing 8 lbs, 6 oz.

   Kate Bolduan is anchoring "New Day" from Buckingham Palace this morning
   with the latest updates on royal baby fever.

   Join us from 6-9am ET on CNN and be sure to follow along
   on [48]Twitter!

   ---------

   [49]CNN Royal Commentator Victoria Arbiter grew up in Windsor and at
   Kensington Palace, and is an expert on the royal family.

   "It's going to be the first time since 1894 the reigning sovereign has
   three direct heirs to the throne living," she explains. "Queen Victoria
   was the last person to have that. So really when you think of the
   history and grandeur of the occasion, that's very exciting." Watch:

   The newest royal is already receiving the pomp and circumstance steeped
   in tradition based on that excitement. Arbiter says the baby's name
   will likely reflect that.

   "The royal family generally chooses dynastic names." Names like Ann,
   Elizabeth, Andrew, Edward are the norm.

   And while Will and Kate have been known to lead more modern, ordinary
   lives, Arbiter says their child's name will likely still be rooted in
   familial history.

   "I think they're going to have quite a hard time balancing their
   desperate desire to be normal while also adhering to the traditions of
   the royal family."

   [50]Katie Nicholl, author of "The Making of A Royal Romance" and the
   Royal Correspondent for British newspaper "The Mail on Sunday" adds to
   that notion of royal protocol.

   "The one thing that Kate will have learned when she married into this,
   the British royal family, is that duty comes before self," Nicholl
   says.  Watch:

   And the expectation is great. [51]CNN's Max Foster is camped outside
   St. Mary's Hospital in London where the Duchess of Cambridge arrived at
   dawn.

   "The first glimpse of the royal heir will be here on the steps of the
   hospital," Foster reports, and a huge amount of media and the public
   are gathered around to witness it.  Watch:

   "This really is a moment in British history. People are very, very
   excited about catching a moment of it."
