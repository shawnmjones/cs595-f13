TED Talks Education congratulates its speaker Dr. Angela Lee Duckworth, who
was named a 2013 MacArthur Fellow on September 25, 2013, for "transforming
our understanding of the roles that grit and self-control play in educational
achievement."

   Public television and [9]TED,Â the non-profit organization devoted to
   Ideas Worth Spreading,Â share a deep commitment to addressing the high
   school dropout crisis. The TED Talks Education one-hour program brings
   together a diverse group of teachers and education advocates delivering
   short, high-impact talks on the theme of teaching and learning.
   TheseÂ original TED Talks are given by thought leaders including
   [10]Geoffrey Canada, [11]Bill Gates, [12]Rita F. Pierson, [13]Dr.
   Angela Lee Duckworth and [14]Sir Ken Robinson. TED Talks Education is
   part of the Corporation for Public Broadcastingâs [15]American Graduate
   initiative. See all [16]speakers and performers.
