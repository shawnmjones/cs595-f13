'Romnesia' extends to marriage equality

   After last week's presidential candidate debate, Bay Buchanan talked to
   reporters in the spin room as a surrogate and senior adviser to the
   Romney campaign. It didn't generate much attention at the time, but
   Buchanan [3]told The Advocate that a Romney administration would treat
   marriage as "a state issue" and would "not get in the way of what
   states decide to do on marriage and adoption."

   So, was this a new attempt at moderation? Maybe another issue receiving
   the Etch A Sketch treatment? As it turns out, no -- Buchanan simply
   came down with [4]a temporary case of Romnesia, and soon after after
   disavowed her own comments.

     ...Buchanan issued a clarification to BuzzFeed this afternoon
     following initial publication of this story, writing, "Governor
     Romney supports a federal marriage amendment to the Constitution
     that defines marriage as an institution between a man and a woman.
     Governor Romney also believes, consistent with the 10th Amendment,
     that it should be left to states to decide whether to grant same-sex
     couples certain benefits, such as hospital visitation rights and the
     ability to adopt children. I referred to the Tenth Amendment only
     when speaking about these kinds of benefits -- not marriage."

   So, according to the campaign, a Romney administration [5]would like to
   write into constitutional stone a prohibition on marriage equality,
   which in turn would eliminate existing state laws that allow same-sex
   couples to get legally married. Romney would also like to see states
   have the power to stop gay adoption and prohibit hospital visitation
   rights for gay families.

   Also note, by signing the National Organization for Marriage's
   candidates pledge, Romney has also [6]promised, not only to support an
   anti-gay constitutional amendment, but also to appoint federal judges
   who don't see a constitutional right to same-sex marriage and to back
   the Defense of Marriage Act. Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, has also
   endorsed amending the U.S. Constitution to prevent marriage equality.

   On this issue, Romney/Ryan is far to the right of Bush/Cheney, even as
   the nation is becoming more progressive on gay civil rights.

   Another reason to realize that, for America, this election is as
   important as was that in 1933 for Germany.

   Yet again, there was no election in Germany in 1933. Hitler became
   chancellor because the German president, Paul von Hindenburg, appointed
   him chancellor in a desperate attempt to gain political stability. A
   good case can be made for comparing today's GOP to fascists of any
   strip, but leave historical fiction out of it.

   When did the huge migration of German immigrants to the U.S. begin? I'd
   like to say it was the late 20's or early 30's.

   Apparently Republicans hate our constitution. So far they've proposed
   amending (includes repealing amendments already in place) the
   following:

   Repeal the 17^th amendment and remove the election of congressional
   representatives by the voters.

   Repeal the 14^th amendment and remove birthright citizenship.

   Proposed an amendment prohibiting the government from owning stock.
   (Think bailouts.)

   Proposed an amendment for Parental Rights which says the government
   can't raise children. (I have no idea. Apparently the government is
   threatening to take over raising our children?)

   Proposed an amendment to impose term limits. (I wholeheartedly support
   this one.)

   Proposed an amendment to criminalize flag desecration. (No more
   garments or furniture depicting our flag.)

   Proposed an amendment making a balanced budget mandatory.

   Propose an amendment that life begins at conception.

   Propose an amendment that declares marriage as something between a man
   and a woman. (Or several women in the case of Romney's grandfather.)

   Propose an amendment requiring two-thirds majority vote for a tax
   increase.

   Propose an amendment capping government spending at a set percentage of
   GDP.

   Actually I thought of that under the Parent Rights amendment. I can
   easily see that becoming the place where all children must be raised as
   Christians. Yeah, I know it's supposed to keep the government out, but
   this is the party that screams about small government while steadfastly
   putting the government in your bedroom...hell, your uterus if you're a
   woman... and thinks it's okay to curtail voting rights, wants to allow
   warrantless arrests, torture, holding a person indefinitely, etc. The
   list is endless.

   I still cannot believe they continue to get away with these constantly
   shifting positions. I mean really, it stuns me to the point that I find
   myself getting more and more angry with every passing day. Back in the
   summer I had no fear of a Romney candidacy because I was SURE the media
   would destroy him for having no core principles. I mean, John Kerry got
   absolutely DESTROYED by the media over a perceived flip-flop on ONE
   issue.

   But sadly, I was way off - the election is 2 weeks away, and Mitt here
   still changes his mind on EVERY ISSUE, sometimes multiple times in the
   course of a single day, but somehow nothing ever sticks to the Amazing
   Teflon Man.

   And the ridiculous false equivalencies - "oh both sides lie". NO. You
   are wrong. There are levels. I have in the course of my life told a lie
   or two. That does NOT make me equal to a person who is a diagnosed
   pathological liar. Likewise, the fact that the President may have
   stretched the truth a bit here and there does NOT make him equal to a
   man whose entire campaign has been one lie after another.

   And yet here we are, 15 days from the election, and it looks
   increasingly likely that the media is going to just let Mitt LIE his
   way straight to the oval office. I simply cannot handle it....

   Sorry, had to rant a little.....

   The hyperventilating by the msm about libya sealed the deal for me on

     "Governor Romney supports a federal marriage amendment to the
     Constitution... Governor Romney also believes, consistent with the
     10th Amendment, that it should be left to states to decide..."

   Is it just me or are these two concepts totally contradictory? I know
   she distinguishing between marriage itself and benefits of marriage,
   but just how, exactly, do you support state rights while invoking a
   federal amendment to the Constitution?

   Contradictory, or just covering all the bases. If "states' rights" gets
   the job done, fine, or if that fails to set inequality into stone then
   they'll go the federal route. It's a matter of expedient, not
   principles.

   Up to now, the states have been very reliable tools to hinder equality.
   But this year it's possible that we may see equality advance for the
   first time at the state level. Possibly the opposition will start
   focusing on the federal level if that happens and just say to hell with
   the states.

   Calling these events 'romnesia' is giving them the benefit of the
   doubt.

   The Romney surrogates tend to give moderate positions when they are
   sitting in front of a TV camera, and then give their actual positions
   to the smaller, usually print, media. How many in the TV audience have
   actually read the clarifications?

   These people have not forgotten Romney's true position. They are
   outright lying to the larger audience.

   This seems to me to part of an even larger problem about Romney. Their
   continued retractions and clarifications are a careful effort to
   confuse voters. The original spot receives a great deal of air and
   print time. It gets set in stone for many voters. Then the retractions
   and clarifications emerge -- sometimes multiple ones for the original
   statement -- and those are buried as simple clean-up, not worthy of
   attention: "pay no attention, nothing to see here, move along." The
   confusion sowed is intentional and malevolent. I wish it were the
   incompetency it is designed to emulate. But I fear it is more.

   The GOP SOP is to take a stand in front of a large audience on every
   side of every issue and then deny later to a smaller audience in the
   hope that voters hear what they want to hear and stop listening.
   Further, should the Bookends win, how can anyone hold them accountable
   for campaign promises? They will merely claim they did what they said
   they would and whip out the confirming clip.

   I am mostly disgusted with the voters who pay absolutely no attention
   to anything and now 15 days before an election they just happen to hear
   an ad on TV or radio or pass by a billboard on the highway and the one
   piece of "non-info" seals the deal for them.

   Keep in mind that if the GOP lies convince folks to vote for them, it
   means that those voters believe what's being said - or what they heard
   being said at that exact moment they heard it!

   I once had a woman ask me to settle an argument she was having with
   another woman. I was living in Florida at the time and the 2 women were
   FL born, raised and educated. They said they both agreed that I, a Damn
   Yankee on any other day, would know the answer to settle the argument.
   The question was "Which state was the 51st state to join the USA;
   Alaska or Hawaii?" Seriously. I asked if it was a joke? She said, No,
   they knew that I would know the answer. So I told them we don't have a
   51st state. All of a sudden, the Damn Yankee didn't know what she was
   talking about any more.

   Do you think we have an education problem in this country?

   I'm beginning to see the advantage of living deep in the wilderness and
   growing my own food! Anyone know of a good commune in the deep
   wilderness? As long as I have the InterWebs!!!

   facts....if Romney(yes, I KNOW he won't) says he believes in gay
   mariiage, he would be called a flip flopper. How come the same is not
   said about our flip flopping President? LEAVE ME ALONE, I have what I
   want, i do NOT need anyone to validate my or my partners existence. We
   all know that Obama flopped on gay marriage because he needs the gay
   vote. When are we going to call it for what it is? He could have dealt
   with this in the house and senate when he had them, be he hadn't
   "evolved" yet. And why did he not put it before the house and senate
   now? Because he is AFRAID that some of the Dems would vote against it
   because they do not want to go on the record on this issue. Check out

   I agree, Obama simply said what was "palatable" to get into the
   running. Had he said anything but he would have been disavowed by

   illegal for gays to get married but "we" got "grandfathered in". Iowa
   is more progressive than even President Obama. I'm so tired of it even
   being an issue that it makes me want to psycho kill at the very mention
   of it. I've been "gay married" to the same individual twice now, our
   "new" anniversary is October 31 as we wanted to avoid the mob-rule of
   Prop 8. I don't need any-body's @!$%#ing blessing for my relationship

   The only reason that marriage is an issue at law is because of the
   legal rights and privileges that come with the certificate. The issue
   for the GOP, as always, is about money. Those "corporations that are
   people" will have to pay medical and pension benefits to spouses they
   presently don't pay for. States will have to let a spouse simply
   inherit property as tenants by the entireties - without being taxed.
   Those come immediately to mind and I'm sure there are many other
   advantages.

   The actual marriage between two consenting adults can be accomplished
   without anyone else's consent - but the attendant rights and privileges
   need government approval.

   Years ago, marriage between a black and a white of any gender was a NO
   NO!! Now it's not because it was discrimination. IMO, it's still
   discrimination to limit anyone's right to "pursue happiness" as they
   like - unless it involves minor children!

   As to states deciding individually rather than a Federal law - since
   when is it OK for We, the People, to allow some states to discriminate
   but not others?

   Furthermore, the GOP because they are too cowardly to admit it's a
   money issue, couch their objection to gay marriage in terms of religion
   and no one's religion belongs in MY Government! This country was
   founded on the principle of freedom from religious persecution - that
   means that Each American Citizen is free FROM Every other American
   Citizen's religion.

   So Romney is free to believe that god was born on the planet Kobol;
   Jews are free to believe that the Messiah is still coming; Christians
   are free to believe that the Messiah already came in the person of
   Jesus, etc. and each one who belongs to any of those relegions is free
   to believe that marriage is whatever that religion dictates they
   believe - BUT the government is NOT free to create laws based on any
   religion!

   Pure and simple it is discrimination. If you let them get away with it
   on this issue, they are coming for your issue next!

   So maybe someone can get them to answer this question: what are the
   legal definitions of "man" and "woman?" Are we talking about:
     * Gross anatomy [1]
     * Genes (XY, XX?)
     * Functioning testes and ovaries?

   This is a problem that calls for the Todd Akin's deep and profound
   understanding of sexual physiology. In the meantime, by all means give
   it a try.

   [1] of the kind that can be rearranged by surgery?

   [2] Look up "androgen insensitivity syndrome." Or Caster Semenya.

   [3] Hysterectomy (or orchiectomy) and boom! Instant annulment.

   MeddlingMonk,

   It is extremely important whether he flip flopped or not. As a gay man
   I am offended that he would try and use us this way. Unless you are
   gay,leave us alone. Attack attack attack. Please defend instead of
   attacking. You can say what you will about spelling, grammar, etc...but
   I get to go in a cast a ballot on election day. Nothing you say or do
   will negate my vote. Thank you trollop, Your words ring true. We are in
