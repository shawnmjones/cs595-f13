   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [44]Tagging tips - [45]Search For Tags - [46]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   different from several other special interest lobbies. IOW, they use
   their clout to intimidate people in Washington. I don't know what we
   can do about it, but I'd sure like to see something done to clean up
   the mess.

 Normally I'd like like this ... ([93]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [94]Eyesbright, [95]btfsilence, [96]Eikyu Saha

   ...because I'm a skeptic of zionism and especially Israel's
   hypocritical covert nuclear arms (which should be dismantled
   immediately before we go forward with anymore actions against Iran).

   However, AIPAC said they were cool with Hagel, so did Schumer, the
   unofficial jewish spokesman of the Senate.

   So I just don't see the opposition that this comic is depicting...

   In fact, most of the anti-Hagel stuff i see is coming from waspy
   neo-cons who just want to fight about anything.

 And the neo-cons are not necessarily ([99]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [100]RJDixon74135

       pro-Israel.  First, because their love of war isn't about saving
       Israel -- it's about conducting an endless Crusade against Muslims
       (a la Huntington's Clash of Civilizations).  Second, they don't
       even support "Israel" per se, they only support Israel's far
       right-wing politicians (i.e., who support settlements and denial of
       human rights for Palestinians).  There are a great many Israelis
       who oppose Netanyahu's caustic policies.
       It is a nasty trick to put the label "Anti-Israel" (implicitly
       meaning "anti-semitic") on people who oppose the inhuman treatment
       of Palestinians.
       Implying that the anti-Hagel group is a "Pro-Israel Lobby"
       unfortunately feeds into this discourse strategy.  It makes it seem
       like those who oppose Hagel are somehow "Pro-Israel."  They're not,
       and they should be called out on it.

 I got an anti-Hagel phone call Tuesday ([113]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [114]Eikyu Saha

   What a waste of somebody's money!
   First, the connection was so scratchy at first that I could barely
   understand what the poor kid in a boiler room somewhere was saying.
   Something about how Obama had appointed Chuck Hagel, a Republican, to
   be Secretary of Defense. I asked who was calling--he said the name of
   the organization a couple of times, but I never could make it out, but
   the kid said, "we're affiliated with the Democratic party."
   Then he tells me to call Chuck Schumer's office and ask him to block
   the nomination. "Why?" I say. "What's your main objection to Hagel?"
   After hemming and hawing, the kid responds, "I don't have that
   information."

   Ok, thanks. Hanging up now.

   Jeez, If you're going to spend money on phone banks, at least give your
   paid minions one talking point to use!

   My husband is on lists of Jewish voters, judging by other mail and
   calls we get. So maybe that's why we got the call.

   that so many Kossacks are supporting Hagel.

   His lifetime American Conservative Union voting record is 84. Why, Joe
   Lieberman's is only 16!

   What are we doing rewarding someone who has spent an entire career
   opposed everything this site has ever stood for?

       at this point, but the president has nominated him, and the senate
       should confirm him, unless there is evidence of illegal or
