[24]Non-Todd Akin GOP congressman: 'The incidence of rape resulting in
pregnancy are very low'

   Rep. Trent Franks
   Rep. Trent Franks
   After the 2012 elections, Republicans vowed not to be tripped up by any
   more [30]Todd Akin-style comments alienating women voters by minimizing
   rape, defying science, and sheer force of idiocy. Apparently Rep. Trent
   Franks [31]did not get that message, though. Franks is pushing a bill
   that would make abortion illegal after 20 weeks, and in opposing a
   Democratic amendment creating exceptions for rape and incest, he had
   this to say:

     "The incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low."

   Actually, as we all found out after Akin's claim that "If it's a
   legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole
   thing down," [32]pregnancy from rape is not rare at all. But
   Republicans like Todd Akin and Trent Franks don't really give a damn
   how rare or common it is for women to face an unwanted pregnancy after
   being raped. That's what absolutism is--there is absolutely no
   circumstance under which they are willing to allow a woman to decide to
   end a pregnancy. Rape and incest just don't register for them.

   Franks went on to echo the logic of Ron Paul's [33]"honest rape"
   comments: There shouldn't need to be a post-20 weeks rape and incest
   exception [34]because "when you make that exception, there's usually a
   requirement to report the rape within 48 hours." So not only does he
   reject the facts on pregnancy and rape, he doesn't begin to get all the
   reasons women don't always immediately report rape.

   And while the party's post-2012 rebranding efforts have tried to keep
   top Republicans from publicly saying this kind of stuff, no exceptions
   for rape or incest remains the [35]official Republican position on
   abortion.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       conclusions from this particular GOP asshat:
       1) rape is somehow OK as long as it doesn't result in an unwanted
       pregnancy
       2) the stats could support his "comments" because so many women
       "post menopause" are raped and included in these stats
       Bottom line:  the new GOP really is going to need a HUGE tent to
       cover up the dinasour it has become.
       While I am a fan of "finding common ground", we should keep in mind
       just who won the election....

       conclusions, you know.
       If you are raped and become pregnant, then that means you weren't
       really raped.  Because you can't get pregnant from being raped.
       Here's the "logic:"
       You can get pregnant from having consensual sex.
       You can't get pregnant from rape.
       You are pregnant, therefore you must have consented somehow.
       See?  It's a nasty little syllogism they've created.

   Humans are the least fertile mammal by a long shot.

   What the stat really shows is that the incidence of pregnancy by rape
   is pretty much exactly the same as the incidence of pregnancy for all
   unprotected intercourse occurring at a random time during the menstrual
   cycle, and obviously higher than consensual intercourse, since that's
   substantially less likely to be unprotected.

   What they're really saying when looking at those stats and claiming the
   "rape makes the body shut down" is that they don't know how human
   reproductive organs, specifically the lady parts, work. But we already
   knew that.

   The number of Americans that support abortion rights without caveat is
   smaller than we like. Similarly, the number that support absolute
   prohibition of abortion are small, if not small enough.

   Much of the public falls into a "sort of support with restrictions"
   category, or "sort of oppose with some exceptions". For those that
   mostly support, some fairly popular restrictions are "parental consent
   for minors", "not in the 3rd trimester", and so on.

   Similarly, for those that mostly oppose abortion rights, there are some
   conditions where they adamantly support it: rape and incest.

   Talk like this isn't directed at us. It's directed at the people who
   are uncomfortable with abortion, but feel it's acceptable in cases of
   rape or incest, and should be legal only in those circumstances, or
   legal more broadly (because it's not our business to conduct an inquest
   whether or not rape or incest was involved).

   This sort of "forcible rape", "rape shuts down the body", "chances of
   getting pregnant from rape are small" comments are clumsy attempts to
   delegitimize the "rape or incest" exception, in the minds of those for
   whom the "rape or incest" exception is important, in the hopes of
   converting them into outright prohibitionists.

   They actively work to make themselves the party of misogynist, bigoted

       It says the same thing. It could be a transcribing error. But I
       doubt it.
       Often, when people use prepositional phrases, especially in oral
       speech, they make this mistake. It's easy to get a little lost,
       grammatically, in a sentence. I see this error on dkos often
       enough. But by "people" I do mean folks casually speaking. So I
       don't care very much.
       A congressman stating any sort of policy (or justification) really
       needs to articulate clearly.
       Yup, I hold them to higher standards, assuming they are native
       speakers of English.
       (For example, I expect them not to say "yup" too.)

       do we want republicans to talk about rape or not? On one hand, it
       helps us win elections.  On the other, it poisons the public
       discourse and contributes to the very problems we mean to solve.

   Is because they know the idea of the government forcing a woman to
   carry a rapists baby to term is horrifying to most Americans. They also
   know that if you do make exceptions for abortion then the whole
   "abortion is murder" artifice crumbles.

   They have to completely decouple rape from pregnancy if they ever want
   to make abortion illegal. Even if we ignore the modern instances of

       The other unstated premise behind opposing a rape exception is that
       women are liars. In other words, if there is an exception for rape
       women will just lie about being raped when they weren't and then
       they get a free pass to have an abortion.
       Same deal with a `health of the mother' exception. We can't have
       that because then women will just lie or fake being sick so they
       can have a free pass. `Life of the mother' is a little different
       because when the woman is observably near death then the people who
       are in a position to judge can see that the bitch don't be lyin'.

 If the Democrats are submitting "exceptions," ([965]0+ / 0-)

   they're already conceded the issue.  This is a typical Dem kabuki
   tactic.  If they had any principles, they'd pitch into a real fight,
   but they don't have any principles "except" their own comforts and
   conveniences and putting on dog and pony shows for the voters.

   Standing aside and tsk tsking from the sidelines is not supporting.

 He's a Republican ([982]0+ / 0-)
