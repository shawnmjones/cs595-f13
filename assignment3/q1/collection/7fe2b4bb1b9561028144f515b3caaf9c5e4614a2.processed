   Now, to find 6 million more like this. And that's just for 2016.

     To squeak out a majority, Mitt Romney probably needs to win at least
     61 percent of the white vote -- a figure exceeding what George H.W.
     Bush commanded over Michael Dukakis in 1988. The Republican
     strategist told Brownstein, "This is the last time anyone will try
     to do this" -- "this" being a near total reliance on white votes to
     win a presidential election.
     --[29]Jonathan Chait

   Or will it?

   Logic would seem to dictate so if you're a conservative election
   strategist. Mitt Romney couldn't even pull in the bare minimum of 61
   percent of the white vote that top Republican strategists felt he would
   need in order to win--and given the fact he lost the popular vote in
   the 2012 election by [30]about four points, it wouldn't have mattered
   even if he had.

   The percentage of white voters in the electorate has been [31]steadily
   declining for decades, while the percentage of Latinos [32]has been
   rising. Given the demographic realities regarding the median age of
   these populations, these trends can only be expected to progress at a
   steeper pace. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) [33]openly admitted that the
   Republican Party was not "generating enough angry white guys" to be
   able to stay in business long-term.

   Let's continue below the fold.

   This obvious reality led many Republican Party stalwarts and media
   water-carriers to confront a seemingly stark reality: appeal more to
   minorities, or suffer the inexorable fate of adverse demography. But as
   Benjy Sarlin notes, these same leading lights have since [34]shifted
   their opinion now that the debate over immigration reform is at hand:

     At the moment, the anti-immigration argument appears to be gaining
     converts fast. On election night, Fox News anchor Brit Hume called
     the "demographic" threat posed by Latino voters "absolutely real"
     and suggested Mitt Romney's "hardline position on immigration" may
     be to blame for election losses. On Monday, Hume declared that
     argument "baloney." The Hispanic vote, he said, "is not nearly as
     important, still, as the white vote."

     Sean Hannity, a reliable bellwether on the right, has been on a
     similar journey since the fall. He announced days after President
     Obama's re-election that he had "evolved" on immigration reform and
     now supported a "path to citizenship" in order to improve relations
     with Hispanic voters. Hannity has now flipped hard against the
     Senate's bill.

     "Not only do I doubt the current legislation will solve the
     immigration problem," he wrote in a June column, "but it also won't
     help the GOP in future elections."

     Hannity and Hume didn't arrive at their latest destination by
     accident. They're just the latest figures on the right to embrace
     the compelling new message that's whipping Republicans against
     immigration reform while still promising a better tomorrow for the
     GOP's presidential candidates.

   The argument, in short, is the one [35]expressed most directly by overt
   racist Pat Buchanan: Why alienate the constituency that gives you the
   vast majority of your votes? From one perspective--perhaps a
   shorter-term one--the argument makes a certain amount of sense. Whites
   will still be the biggest share of the vote for the next several
   election cycles. Hispanics, while growing rapidly, are still a smaller
   share; but even if they weren't, they don't agree with conservative
   perspectives on [36]social issues, the [37]role of government, or even
   [38]capitalism in general. In this electoral worldview, acquiescing to
   immigration reform merely opens a crack in the door to allow a
   conversation with an audience that is inherently hostile--at the
   potential expense of alienating the core Republican demographic.

   It's a fair argument to make, but one that's fraught with obvious
   peril. As mentioned, the share of the white vote is in significant
   decline. If the Republican candidates indeed seek to play exclusively
   to the white vote as their method of winning elections and perform no
   better with minorities than they do right now, they will need perhaps
   65 percent of white voters in 2016, and 70 percent or more in the next
   decade. It's one thing for conservative leaders to say that this is
   what they intend to do; it's quite another to actually do it. In 2012,
   Mitt Romney would have needed northward of 60 percent of the white vote
   in order to win. He couldn't even break that figure while running
   against a black president in a relatively weak economy, all as
   conservative media figures sought to inflame the polarizing politics of
   racial resentment.

   How, then, do conservative intellectual leaders propose to change the
   Republican Party's policy and media structure to increase their already
   dominant share of the white vote by 10 points or more in order to just
   stay competitive in subsequent presidential cycles?

   The answer to the question of how to get even more whites to vote for
   Republican candidates depends on whom you ask. The most prominent
   culture warriors on the right argue simply that millions of white
   voters [39]stayed home because Mitt Romney just wasn't conservative
   enough:

     White voters stayed home, Limbaugh said in May, because "they didn't
     think the Republican Party was conservative enough."

     You can hear the "missing whites" thesis everywhere once you start
     looking for it. Hannity cited York's piece in his column opposing
     the "Gang of Eight" bill. Social conservative leader Phyllis
     Schlafly recently told a radio host that "the people the Republicans
     should reach out to are the white votes, the white voters who didn't
     vote in the last election and there are millions of them." There's
     "not any evidence at all that these Hispanics coming in from Mexico
     will vote Republican," she said.

   The problem with the Limbaugh/Schlafly analysis, though, is that it's
   almost certainly wrong. They're right that fewer white voters showed up
   in 2012 than could have been expected, but those numbers simply don't
   change the equation. Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics did a
   [40]comprehensive evaluation of the "missing white voter" from a
   conservative perspective, and estimated that 6.1 million fewer white
   voters showed up to vote than could have been projected. Ruy Teixeira
   and Alan Abramowitz [41]demonstrated that Trende's analysis is flawed,
   in no small part because 2012 had significantly lower turnout than 2008
   and Trende does not account for the millions of "missing minority
   voters" who could also have been expected to show up. But for the sake
   of argument, let's ignore that and take Trende's hypothesis at face
   value: let's say those millions of white voters had shown up without
   any corresponding rise in the minority vote. Would it have mattered?

     But while this was the most salient demographic change, it was
     probably not, standing alone, enough to swing the election to Obama.
     After all, he won the election by almost exactly 5 million votes. If
     we assume there were 6.5 million "missing" white voters, than means
     that Romney would have had to win almost 90 percent of their votes
     to win the election.

     Give that whites overall broke roughly 60-40 for Romney, this seems
     unlikely. In fact, if these voters had shown up and voted like
     whites overall voted, the president's margin would have shrunk, but
     he still would have won by a healthy 2.7 percent margin.

   Where this "missing white vote" is located is even more telling in this
   regard. Trende's analysis of changes in turnout between 2008 and 2012,
   colorfully illustrated [42]here, indicates that the sharpest dropoffs
   in turnout that would cause this phenomenon occurred in the Northeast
   and Midwest, whereas by contrast:

     [T]urnout is surprisingly stable in the Deep South; Romney's problem
     was not with the Republican base or evangelicals (who constituted a
     larger share of the electorate than they did in 2004).

   Why does that matter? Because the statistic about Romney winning 59
   percent of the white vote, while accurate, is also misleading. When
   analyzed by region, the white vote is not monolithic: President Obama
   actually [43]won a majority of the white vote in the Northeast, and did
   not perform badly in the Midwest. The data is skewed by Obama's
   ultimately unsurprising performance among Southern whites, among whom
   he got less than 30 percent of the vote. Schlafly and Limbaugh make the
   mistake of assuming that Trende's so-called "downscale, Northern, rural
   whites" would have performed for Romney at an even stronger clip than
   evangelical Southern white voters did had they turned out to vote.
   Those who argue, then, for further radicalization as the key to winning
   a high enough share of the white vote to keep the Republican Party
   viable long-term are clearly out on an increasingly thin limb. But if
   extreme conservative radicalism isn't the answer, what is?

   Much of the conversation among conservatives on where the Republican
   Party goes from here centers around the notion of "libertarian
   populism." [44]Tim Carney and [45]Ben Domenech have each written about
   the need for the Republican Party to move beyond simply being the party
   of the rich because there aren't enough votes there. To be viable
   long-term, they argue, Republicans need to embrace a campaign that will
   appeal to the disaffected, and cast the blame for their ills on big
   government as well as big business. Says Carney:

     The GOP is out of power and it needs to play to the disaffected. The
     disaffected are not the wealthy, an obvious point that conservatives
     can't seem to understand. The wealthy got wealthier under Obama, and
     corporations earned record profits while median family earnings
     fell. Obama uses these facts to defuse the charges he's a socialist.
     Republicans should use them to show that Obama's big government
     expands the privileges of the privileged class.

     Instead of trying to convince successful people that Democrats will
     take away their wealth, why not explain to the middle class that big
     government is keeping them down?

   Domenech' take is similar, and references the Republican Party's need
   to divorce itself from the concept of "big," whether applied to
   government or banks. As Thomas Edsall [46]writes in the New York Times,
   however, messaging along these lines would constitute a huge break from
   current orthodoxy: The GOP has continuously advocated for the interests
   of the elite over those of the downtrodden. Still, if leading
   conservative luminaries, including [47]Ross Douthat, are pushing for at
   least a messaging shift that positions the Republican Party in
   opposition to the influence of large corporations, that would be a
   welcome development--as would potential evolutions on marijuana
   legalization, interventionism and marriage equality. But what does a
   Republican-themed libertarian populist agenda actually look like from
   an economic perspective? Domenech explains:

     In fact, most of the biggest problems with today's economy are the
     result of government, which has damaged the labor market with awful
     incentives (disability, overgenerous unemployment, awful retraining
     programs, minimum wages and other barriers to entry, tax/regulatory
     discrimination against small businesses, etc.) which need to be
     eliminated. Republicans haven't been aggressive about pushing out an
     agenda for working moms, when getting the government out of the way
     is exactly the sort of policy push they need to hear, in more
     tangible terms.

     Libertarian populism strikes at the heart of these problems by going
     beyond "tax cuts for the rich", and instead targeting bold reforms
     which go beyond tweaking the state and actually take an axe to it.
     Consider the tax issue as a central aspect of this: you argue for a
     flat code in order to achieve a flatter code, one which limits the
     abusive power of the IRS, generates economic growth, and prevent
     cronies from lobbying for, and benefiting from, loopholes
     individuals and small businesses can never access.

   In other words, "libertarian populism" is the belief that markets would
   function perfectly if government would stop creating distortions: a
   classic Chicago School economic argument. This agenda should sound
   familiar: After all, it's the same dismantling of the social safety net
   and progressive tax code that Republicans have traditionally argued
   for. The only difference is that this time, this proposed erosion of
   protections for the working class is simply dubbed as helping the
   working class free itself of the burden of government. With a few
   exceptions, such as paying lip-service to popular sentiments against
   big banks, the conservative intellectual class seems to have decided
   that it's not really the product that needs tweaking--it's just the
   packaging. Mike Konczal at the Washington Post characterizes it
   [48]thus:

     As Ross Douthat notes, this is an approach that deserves to lose
     given the economic realities facing the working class. From the
     voter's perspective, one immediate problem is that libertarian
     populism looks less like a genuinely new agenda and more like a
     fresh marketing spin on the GOP's current platform favoring "job
     creators."

   True. But even if this message were different from contemporaneous
   Republican economic orthodoxy, it presupposes the idea that Trende's
   "rural Northern white voters" are staying home because they would vote
   Republican if they did vote, but that Republican candidates aren't
   economically libertarian or anti-government enough for their
   sensibilities. It also presupposes that all these voters would somehow
   be more willing to vote if Republican strategists could somehow figure
   out how to dress the same old policies in the correct libertarian
   clothing.

   Before going down this road, maybe the Republican Party will want to
   invest in polling to test the attractiveness of the new ideas and
   solutions they simply don't have. After all: You don't want to go
   trying to get 6 million disaffected white voters to all get out to the
   polls and vote for you without the right outfit to disguise the same
   old policies that made them stay home in the first place.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [64]Civil
   Rights, [65]Community, [66]Congress, [67]Culture, [68]Economy,

   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([83]California, [84]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these

       when you actually had responsible Republicans.  I'm an older white
       male and if they think they can get my vote with the policies the
       Republicans are currently pushing they have another think coming.
       I have never missed a national election since 1964 and I will vote
       a straight Democratic ticket until the Republicans get some sense,
       if that unlikely event ever happens!

   A significant part of the white vote is not batshit crazy. And the more

   every non-voting wingnut they get to the polls.

   If they get any more hard right (i.e. crazier), their white voters are
   going  to get uneasy and start to vanish. All we have to do to see that
   is look at the results in the Missouri and Indiana races, where the
   electorate is very white and very conservative. Then their candidates
   lobbed a Crazybomb that detonated them right into the loser column.

   republican candidates twice in my life, on the same ballot. that was 30
   years ago, and I've never done it since. why do I feel like I walked
   into a "12-Step" program meeting here?

   if your party relies solely on elderly white, (mostly) male people, to
   elect your candidates, and the population demographic is trending
   female/minority/younger, I think it's safe to say you have a problem.
   you don't even need to be nate silver to see this.

   if your party, knowing the above, decides to go "all in" on your base
   voter demo, instead of evolving with the population, it should go
   extinct. no meteor need apply.

   I did sift through individual candidates and base my votes based on

   necessarily always agree with the Democrat, but I do know that the GOP

   It was for Nixon because he promised to end the Vietnam war. I have
   never voted for a Republican since. I have also never missed voting in
   an election since I've been eligible to vote. In that distant past,
   there were Republicans I respected, but since the "Reagan Revolution" I
   have grown to find Republicans ever more despicable to the point I
   actually now revile them. I no longer have any Republican friends or
   family members. I don't vote for every Democrat to be sure, but I
   haven't voted for a Republican since Nixon. I am white, male, a gun
   owning Vietnam veteran and over 65 years old living in a rural area and
   I cannot imagine voting for a Republican ever again.

       I think someone here mentioned that Mark O'Mara is a Teabagger, and
       certainly he fits the profile.  (Since he has no problem with
       profiling, apparently, I'll toss a bit back at him.)
       In commenting after the Zimmerman trial concluded, he crowed that
       he was "ecstatic" and did not have the grace to express even the
       vaguest hint of remorse that a young, innocent American boy had
       died or to extend sympathy to the Martin family.
       His absolute insensitivity spoke volumes about him and about the
       Teabagger mentality; these people have no shred of shame, no iota
       of concern about "justice for all" and no understanding of right
       and wrong; what matters to them is the idea that they must never be

       WE are their arch-enemies, because so many of those of us who
       identify as "white" have made common cause with blacks, Hispanics,
       and native peoples; and the men among us have made common cause

   their current demographic shortfall, is by making things tough for
   women of reproductive age.

   Specifically, a way to create disaffected white males--the core

          [868]Mokurai, [869]orangecurtainlib

   The GOPers who are frantically seizing on Sean Trende's thesis of
   disappearing white voters as justification for getting ever more
   right-wing are, true to form, ignoring the part of Trende's analysis
   that doesn't conform to their ideology. Trende's basic idea is that the
   missing white voters in 2012 are essentially the same bloc of voters
   who cast ballots for Ross Perot in 1992:

   "The drop in turnout occurs in a rough diagonal, stretching from
   northern Maine, across upstate New York (perhaps surprisingly, turnout
   in post-Sandy New York City dropped off relatively little), and down
   into New Mexico. Michigan and the non-swing state, non-Mormon Mountain
   West also stand out. For those with long memories, this stands out as
   the heart of the "Perot coalition." That coalition was strongest with
   secular, blue-collar, often rural voters who were turned off by Bill
   Clinton's perceived liberalism and George H.W. Bush's elitism.

   "Perhaps most intriguingly, even after all of these controls are in
   place, the county's vote for Ross Perot in 1992 comes back
   statistically significant, and suggests that a higher vote for Perot in
   a county did, in fact, correlate with a drop-off in voter turnout in
   2012... What does that tell us about these voters? As I noted, they
   tended to be downscale, blue-collar whites. They weren't evangelicals;
   Ross Perot was pro-choice, in favor of gay rights, and in favor of some
   gun control. You probably didn't know that, though, and neither did
   most voters, because that's not what his campaign was about... His
   campaign was focused on his fiercely populist stance on economics. He
   was a deficit hawk, favoring tax hikes on the rich to help balance the
   budget. He was staunchly opposed to illegal immigration as well as to
   free trade (and especially the North American Free Trade Agreement). He
   advocated more spending on education, and even Medicare-for-all. Given
   the overall demographic and political orientation of these voters, one
   can see why they would stay home rather than vote for an urban liberal
   like President Obama or a severely pro-business venture capitalist like
   Mitt Romney."

   [870]http://www.realclearpolitics.com/...

   The new GOP revisionists are focusing exclusively on Perot's
   anti-immigration views to justify their whites-only strategy for 2016,
   but they're ignoring the other points Trende makes about Perot: that he
   was pro-choice, pro-gay rights, advocated some gun control, wanted
   higher taxes on the rich, more spending on education, and
   "Medicare-for-all," which sounds suspiciously like a single-payer
   health care system.

   Anybody who's paying attention to the current nature of the Republican
   Party has to acknowledge that there isn't a single Republican on the
   planet who could win even a single Presidential primary in 2016 while
   espousing these views; to the contrary, it almost a certainty that the
   GOP nominee will be a Christianist Creationist who denies evolution, is
   militantly anti-choice and anti-gay marriage, hates Social Security and
   Medicare, and regards any attempt to pass even mild gun control
   measures or raise taxes on the wealthy as tantamount to supporting Al
   Queda. If Trende's thesis about the missing white voters being
   Perot-style in their views is correct, then the potential for the
   likely GOP nominee to reap the missing six million votes is slim, to
   put it mildly.

 Wondering about the Latino vote... ([1010]1+ / 0-)

   Among other holdovers from Jim Crow, the "one-drop" rule means that if
   the parents are of different races, any black ancestry means that a
   child is black, and any Latino ancestry means that you are Latino.

   A conservative Facebook friend of mine has five children.  Hers is a
   traditional family with a male breadwinner (a Democrat whom she's
   absolutely gaga over);  she's white and he's not.  Chances are that the
   children are going to be preferentially exposed to conservative views.
    (In other matters, she's a great parent.)  By the one-drop rule, the
   children will be Latino.

   There's always the option of pitting Latino against African-American as
   well.

   "big" anything is a glance at any of their campaign finance reports.
   They're completely owned (Yes, I know the Democrats get some donations,
   but nothing like the average Republican). We had a candidate for U.S.
   Senate in Ohio last year, Josh "The Empty suit" Mandel, who was a
   plaything of virtually every "big" special interest you could name from
   Murray Coal to Monsanto to the NRA.

   The other problem with running against BOTH big government and big
   corporations is that we need the former to keep the latter in check.
   That's what it's for. Our government is US -- it's our voice and our
   power to protect ourselves from corporate predators (And hey -- Harry
   Reid: I expect you to confirm my homeboy Rich Cordray this week because
   NO ONE is better at it than him which is why the GOP is shitting its
   pants).

   By eliminating big government how do Republicans plan to check big
   corporations? Oh right -- they don't. It's the same ol same ol, but
   they're trying to cloak it in even MORE deceptive language.

   I have never voted for a Republican.

   I spend my energy getting white Democrats to vote. Those that do not
   normally vote are getting more and more disgusted with and afraid of
   Republicans.

   So, sure, let's get more white people to vote. Let's get more of

   This is a well-written and well-researched diary and I have nothing bad
   to say about it.  But none of it matters, and it won't translate into a
   better future, unless we get money out of politics.

   The Rs are doomed unless they moderate or modernize, that is clear.
   The time will come when they will need to go cold turkey on the tea
   bags and mixed nuts or face extinction.  But that doesn't really help
   the country or its people, because corporate money has already bought
   so many Ds, and if the Rs fade into irrelevance then the rest of the Ds
   will be quickly brought into their pockets.

   Third, fourth, or fifth parties (viable ones, not fringe ones) won't
   help either, because as soon as they're big enough to be a threat,
   they'll be bought, too.

   Corporate money is vast, and remember that real reformers also have to
   run the media gauntlet in order to win (Howard Dean, anyone?)

   Getting corporate money out of politics is the only political goal that
   should matter to us, because a purchased shell with a D stuck on his or
   her suit is, at best, a hollow victory.

   to get as bizarre as the Teahadi at some point.

   This is an existential crisis for the GOP.

   Let's think about voter disenfranchisement schemes.

   You can't vote if you are a felon. It can be a pain in the ass to get
   your vote back after you have served your time and done your probation.

   Looking at what the GOP has done on denying non-Republicans of color
   the right to vote freely, with an assist from the Supreme Court on the
   Voting Rights Act, it's not that hard to imagine some pretty blatant
   ratfucks going right from the Heritage Foundation and ALEC and right
   into the books that are based on the idea that losing your right to
   vote is making amends for an outstanding sin against society, the
   definition of outstanding sin being really flexible. AKA "Doesn't vote
   Republican".

   At some point, listening to a freak like Paul LePage or a snake like
   Scott Walker, it's not hard to see a GOP that won't rule anything out
   to win and keep power.

   Denying people the right to vote, and couch it in an extension of being
   a criminal or being somebody who has "burdened" society in some way
   worthy enough to lose the right the vote as a part of making amends to
   society to muddy the waters.

   What if you can't vote for other 'new' sins?

   Like being behind on your student loans.
   Or you have defaulted on a payday loan and have a civil case loss that
   is unresolved.
   Or having declared bankruptcy. You can't vote until seven years have
   passed.
   Or owing outstanding speeding tickets.
   Or having defaulted on a medical debt that the US government may have
   had to eat.

   Or more subtle than this costs you your vote outright.

   What if this is gets you flagged to have to show a bunch of IDs to vote
   on election day if not outright curbing your right to vote.

   And since its a ratfuck, you design a mechanism so that people likely
   to vote for you get a pass, or have a way out, and those who don't get
   screwed.

   A team of Tea Party poll workers who says yes, you can vote, this is
   not a big deal, or no, you can' t vote without the multiple IDs.

   I don't think we should give the Movement Conservatives any assumption
   of good faith on any front. It may sound absurd on it's face to a
   person who is not a Republican trying to ratfuck his or her way to
   continued viability.

   There is no voter fraud. The only case that I can think of here in
   Nevada was a Movement Conservative talk radio and Fox News fan who
   tried to vote for Romney twice to "prove" voter fraud was possible. The
   idea that poor black people are rigging elections so rich white people
   can't vote is as absurd as the notion that poor people coming to Las
   Vegas are rigging the Casinos so Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson can't
   make money.

   And yet.

   You need to jump through hoops, and pay a poll tax in ID form, for the
   sin of not voting Republican, if the GOP can get those laws in place.
   And the media has been pretty compliant when it comes to "report the
   controversy" and "take the conservative charges seriously, else we are
   guilty of being hostile to conservatives."

   Think of a way that a Republican Governor or Republican Legislature can
   ratfuck you out of your vote for the sin of not voting for GOP
   candidates.

   There is probably no idea too bold, or too un-American, to consider if
   you are a Teahadi.

   It's not like the racism, or class warfare, or targeting scheme has to
   be subtle. It's not like the Village is going to go muck raking all of
   a sudden about the Right abusing the system. If anything, the Village
   might help them muddy the waters about why curbing people's right to
   vote is a good idea.

   This is the great failure in most analyses of WTF Republicans Are

   They're not in politics to win elections.

   They're in politics to win power.

   If elections, tweaked ever so gently and airwaves swamped every so

   And our right wing brethren are blatant about what they have in mind

       I'm a bit guilty about feeling that way, but it's true.
       These people are a cancer twisted by hate to the point that they're
       willing to go terrorist, so let them cross that line and be treated
       like the terrorists they are! It's hard to win elections when your
       base is dead in shootouts with police and national guard or in jail
       for violent crimes.
       As a white man, I've been around enough of them to know the deal.
       They talk to me thinking I'm one of them until I say different.
       They are an isolated, spread out group of mostly rural small town
       hicks blinded by the fact that everyone they know for two hundred
       miles is the same as them but unable to comprehend the math that
       there are more people in urban liberal America than all of their
       country counties combined. They cannot win, but they're desperate
       and stupid enough to try it.
       If hateful rhetoric is destroying their brand, just imagine what
       actual violence will do. Those sympathetic to but not extreme
       enough to condone violence will split off from them in a hurry,
       while those who remain will be eliminated by lead bullets or steel
       bars. It will be the end of the radical right in this country
       forever.
       It will of course suck in the short term, but in the long run it
       beats waiting for them to slowly dry up and blow away.
       Now please note I'm not advocating for violence, and I certainly
       don't think any of us should be committing any. But if these people
       want to resort to violence, I say we be ready for them and meet
       their offensive with a powerful counteroffensive that will settle
       the matter once and for all. In other words, I don't want us to
       start the fight, but I'm ready for us to finish it.

   They Still Insist on waging a WAR against Women.

   The GOP controlled House will do absolutely NOTHING
   to Pass the Immigration Bill Already passed by the Senate.

   The GOP Refused to do ANYTHING on Gun Reform.

   Yes, it's that horrible minimum wage, and those ghastly "overly

   middle class is circling the drain.

   If only the middle class could jettison those remaining "market
   distortions". Like a living wage, or protection from lethal workplace

   Democratic, I suggest that you have left out a major point favoring a

   those who might be inclined to vote for a Democrat.  Already the

   denying the right to vote.  I think that may be the effort that

   Is that even under the best of circumstances, it's a temporary stop gap

   whites stay home because the candidates aren't "conservative" enough,
   something for which there is no basis, you're still stuck with the
   reality that latinos and young people aren't voting for them and have
   no incentive to. At this point, it's a stick your finger in the dam
   strategy. Couple that with the fact that church attendance is on a
   steady decline. Something no amount of gerrymandering and voter
   suppression can fix.

   At best their "plan" my extend their influence another decade but then
   what? And even that's assuming they get all those whites to the polls
   in their favor.

   The GOP has already proven that they can win majorities at the state

   the popular vote.  They keep this up for another decade or so and
   they're going to do so much damage it will take almost half a century

 WHICH white voters. ([1287]0+ / 0-)

   As some commenters have stated of themselves, they, like me, are white
   voters who aren't attracted to the current Republican BS.

   One thing that Republicans in parts of the country have learned is that
   overt racism sometimes loses white votes. Genrally, in the Chicago
   suburbs, you want to come across to white voters as moderate on race.
   Go too far, and you lose the soccer moms.

   What they are going to see is not only a smaller %age of white voters,
   but a larger %age of Anglo voters related to Latino voters. That's
   going to cause some real headaches to the hardest liners. You don't
   necessarily have to convince Latinos that you are for their rights, but
   if you fail to convince Latinos' mothers in law that you are for their
   tights you lose one hell of a lot of votes, and true opinion makers.
