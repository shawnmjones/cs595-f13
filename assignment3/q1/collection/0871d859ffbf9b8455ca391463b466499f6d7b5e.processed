Eliminating Killer Diseases with New Medicines

     For people suffering from serious but treatable diseases like
     pneumonia and tuberculosis, access to drugs can mean the difference
     between life and death. A new report and two recent announcements
     are signs of progress in efforts to expand access.

   In the developed world, we sometimes take life-saving medicines for
   granted. But as I've traveled in the developing world, I've seen
   first-hand the huge difference they can make. A new report and two
   recent announcements are reminders of the important role of the
   pharmaceutical industry, especially in helping save the lives of people
   in poor countries.
   The new report is the [13]Access to Medicine Index 2010 from the Access
   to Medicine Foundation, based in the Netherlands. The index ranks 20 of
   the world's largest pharmaceutical companies on their efforts to make
   sure that medicines are made for and reach people in developing
   countries. The latest index found that companies are being more
   transparent about their efforts to expand access. They've also taken
   steps to make drug pricing more equitable and to increase R&D on
   diseases affecting poor countries. But in the words of the Index's
   founder Wim Leereveld, "the industry as a whole still has a long way to
   go."
   One example of progress on access is the announcement
   by [14]GlaxoSmithKline and [15]Pfizer Inc. that they will accelerate
   production and distribution of new vaccines against pneumococcal
   disease, which kills 1.6 million people a year--mostly in developing
   countries, and half of them children under the age of five.
   Glaxo and Pfizer will supply 30 million doses a year, for 10 years, at
   a price that is more affordable for developing countries. Estimates are
   that the vaccines could save 900,000 lives by 2015, and up to 7 million
   lives by 2030. Key to this effort was an innovative financing
   mechanism, known as an [16]Advance Market Commitment, piloted by the
   [17]GAVI Alliance. I am pleased that our foundation was able to support
   this effort in partnership with GAVI, the World Bank, the World Health
   Organization, UNICEF and the national governments of Italy, Canada,
   Norway, Russia, and the United Kingdom.
   In another important effort supported by the foundation, the
   non-profit [18]Critical Path Institute (C-Path) and the Global Alliance
   for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) will coordinate testing of
   promising combinations of tuberculosis drug candidates from at least 11
   different pharmaceutical companies early in the development pipeline.
   If you used the historical approach to testing and getting regulatory
   approval for new TB drugs--individually and then in combination with
   other drugs--it could take 24 years. This new approach, which the
   foundation created in partnership with C-Path and the TB Alliance,
   hopes to develop effective new combination TB treatments in just six
   years. Importantly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
   regulatory authorities in Europe have indicated strong support for
   accelerating approvals of safe, effective new treatments.
   Although many people think of TB as a disease that was conquered long
   ago, it still kills 1.8 million people a year, mainly in the poorest
   countries on earth. The current four-drug course of treatment for TB is
   now 50 years old and requires patients to take numerous pills for six
   months or longer, which many find difficult, especially given the
   often-unpleasant side effects. When patients don't complete their
   course of treatment, the disease can become resistant to the initial
   drugs. In 2007, there were more than 500,000 cases of drug-resistant
   TB. New and easier ways to treat TB would be a great step forward.
   I believe that these kinds of innovative collaborations between
   pharmaceutical companies, governments and the non-profit sector are
   critical to accelerating the delivery of medicines, which is critical
   to saving lives.

Annual Letter: A Health Emergency

   The world's making progress against malaria, neonatal deaths and
   HIV/AIDS, but not enough. In his 2011 letter as co-chair of the Bill &
   Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill explains why he's willing to be viewed
   as a troublemaker by people who are happy with the status quo.
