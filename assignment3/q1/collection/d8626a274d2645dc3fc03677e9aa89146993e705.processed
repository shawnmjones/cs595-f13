Trailer pulled by father accidentally kills boy at Oklahoma July 4 parade

   By Mayra Cuevas and Greg Botelho, CNN
   July 5, 2013 -- Updated 1602 GMT (0002 HKT)
   A boy died Thursday in an accident at a Fourth of July parade in
   Edmond, Oklahoma.
   A boy died Thursday in an accident at a Fourth of July parade in
   Edmond, Oklahoma.
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: A tractor and fire engine in a fatal Maine parade crash had
       been rerouted
     * The tractor driver died after being hit by a fire truck during the
       Bangor, Maine, event
     * A boy either fell or jumped off a float in Edmond, Oklahoma, police
       say
     * The boy was run over by a trailer being towed by his father,
       according to police

   (CNN) -- An 8-year-old boy died when a trailer being pulled by his
   father ran over him during an Oklahoma Fourth of July parade, while a
   man driving a tractor died in a collision with a vintage fire truck in
   another parade nearly 2,000 miles northeast.

   The young boy either fell or jumped off the float late Thursday morning
   and was run over by the trailer carrying it, according to police in
   Edmond, which is about 15 miles north of Oklahoma City.

   The boy's father was in the truck that was towing the trailer, which
   was filled with hay and decorated by small patriotic garland along its
   edges. The float had a martial-arts theme, according to police
   spokeswoman Jennifer Monroe.

   The father rushed out of the vehicle, and he and a nurse who had been
   riding in a car behind the float performed CPR on the child, police
   said.

   Video from [38]CNN affiliate KFOR later showed first responders along
   the road, which appeared to be bordered by trees, and moving a
   stretcher with the child into an awaiting ambulance.
   Accidents tarnish holiday celebrations

   The boy was later pronounced dead at a hospital, Monroe said.

   "Our thoughts today for the family of a 7 yr old boy killed in a float
   accident at the end of the LibertyFest parade," [39]Edmond police said
   Thursday in a tweet. "Heartbreaking."

   [40]Money magazine a few years ago listed Edmond, a city of about
   81,000 people, as 35th on its list of America's best small cities. The
   annual LibertyFest festivities around Independence Day -- highlighted
   by the parade -- was singled out as a "must-go event" in the city,
   according to the publication, which like CNN is a division of Time
   Warner.

   The Edmond incident wasn't the only parade fatality this Independence
   Day.

   [41]July 4 accidents

   A man driving a green tractor in Bangor, Maine, died instantly Thursday
   afternoon after a vintage fire truck hit him from behind, police said
   in a statement. Both vehicles were part of the Bangor-Brewer July
   Fourth parade, which is the state's largest such parade with more than
   1,000 participants and 30,000 spectators, [42]according to Gov. Paul
   LePage.

   Police officers in the city's accident reconstruction team, evidence
   response team and criminal investigations division -- as well as the
   medical examiner's office and a Maine State Police member -- are
   assisting in the investigation, according to Bangor police.

   Police Sgt. Paul Edwards explained that the parade was rerouted because
   of a four-hour standoff in Bangor with a man who'd shot a gun,
   prompting a woman and her baby to run for help.

   "They would not have been on that street normally," Edwards said of the
   people driving the tractor and fire truck.

   The suspect fired several rounds at police from a second-floor
   apartment window, with authorities responding with several rounds of
   their own and tear gas.

   The man -- identified by police as 43-year-old Perrin Oliver -- was
   taken into custody around 12:20 p.m. and charged with criminal
   threatening and aggravated reckless conduct with a firearm, both
   felonies. Edwards, the Bangor police spokesman, said he doubts Oliver
   will face additional charges tied to the tractor driver's death.

   CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.
