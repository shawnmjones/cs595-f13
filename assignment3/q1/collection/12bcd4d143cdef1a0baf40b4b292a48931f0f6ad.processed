Ojibwe Women Vow to 'Sit on the Mountain'

   In Wisconsin, new iron-ore mining legislation threatens the Penokee
   Mountains, upstream from the Bad River reservation. Some say that Gov.
   Scott Walker and other mining proponents are about to encounter a force
   of nature: Objibwe women bent on preserving family and community.
   [16]By Mary Annette Pember

   Lake Superior Mary Annette PemberThe shores of Lake Superior in the Bad
   River Ojibwe reservation are downstream from a proposed open pit
   iron-ore mine. The lake is a force of nature, and so are the Native
   American women who vow to "sit on the mountain" to stop the mining.

   Ojibwe men are easily identified by the notorious flatness of their
   rear ends. According to my mom, those butts got that way because of the
   enthusiastic verbal skills of Ojibwe women.  She meant this in a good
   way, however, since our women are famous for tenaciously keeping our
   families together, defending them against all threats, both inside and
   out.

   Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker doesn't know this yet, but he will soon
   resemble an Ojibwe man.  I almost feel sorry for him. He is soon to run
   head on, or rear on, into the buzz saw that is the angry Ojibwe woman
   in full out defense mode.

   He and his fellow Republicans have finally pushed a mining bill through
   the legislature that will allow the creation of a huge open pit iron
   ore mine just south of the Bad River Ojibwe reservation on the shores
   of Lake Superior. A similar bill was narrowly defeated in 2011,
   igniting some of the most vocal environmental protests that the state
   has seen in years.  (See my stories for the [17]Yonder and [18]Indian
   Country Today Media Network for more background.) The Republican
   dominated assembly and senate, however, redrafted the bill that handily
   passed both houses this week.  Gov. Walker is expected to sign the
   legislation this week and probably anticipates smooth sailing for the
   much-touted jobs bill.

   Republicans maintain that by diminishing current mining laws, the new
   bill will help create jobs in the economically depressed northern part
   of the state. Tribal members and concerned citizens, however, argue
   that the proposed open pit iron mine will pose serious environmental
   hazards to the water, wildlife and quality of life in this pristine
   woodland.  Indeed, the language in the new law [19]presumes damage to
   wetlands and includes a mitigation plan that Democrats argue is not
   viable.

   Streamside Mary Annette Pember]Paige Wiggins, the author's cousin,
   takes a break alongside a stream in the Penokee Mountains, proposed
   site for mining near the Bad River reservation. Natural forces here are
   the "great leveler."

   According to a [20]story in The Duluth Tribune, under this new mining
   plan, state environmental officials would have up to 480 days to make a
   permitting decision. Currently there is no deadline. This public
   couldn't challenge a permit decision until after it has been made.
   Opponents describe the legislation as a corporate giveaway and note
   that it was written largely by representatives of Gogebic Taconite, the
   Florida based company that plans to build the huge mine in the Penokee
   Hills. The Penokee Hills or Mountains lie just upstream of the Bad
   River reservation.

   A recent report by the non-profit organization Wisconsin Democracy
   Campaign found that special interest groups backing the mining bill
   such as construction, heavy equipment, transportation and other
   companies contributed more than $15. 6 million to the Republican
   controlled legislature and GOP Gov. Scott Walker. Money and political
   influence appear to have won out despite heroic efforts by Democrats
   who tried to stave off the bills passage Thursday with over 9 hours of
   debate.

   "I'm glad Wisconsin is open for business but sad that it's for sale to
   the highest bidder," noted state representative Nick Milroy in the
   final moments before the legislature voted to pass the contentious
   mining bill.

   Bad River tribal chairman Mike Wiggins Jr. has promised "active
   resistance" from the tribe to any efforts to build the mine. As a
   sovereign nation, the Bad River tribe controls their own EPA standards
   regarding water and air quality. This authority could thwart the mine
   permitting process. Moreover, my cousin Marylu informed me that the
   women of Bad River and their supporters are prepared to "sit on the
   mountain," if necessary.

   Bad River tribal chairman Mike Wiggins Jr. discusses reaction to
   proposed mining near the reservation. A 2011 proposal was defeated but
   looks likely to be signed into law this week by Wisc. Gov. Scott
   Walker. (Click the photo to play the video.)

   Although this may conjure a benign image for non-Indians, it makes me
   tremble a bit. . Like tidal waves and nuclear reactions, the power of
   angry Ojibwe women, especially in defense of family and community, is
   an overwhelming, inexorable force.

   I think of my great auntie Pat sitting in her easy chair in the cramped
   living room of her little HUD home where she held court.  Like most
   Ojibwe women of her generation, she was small. At first glance one
   could mistake her for a child sitting in that enormous chair. But when
   she was mad, she had a way of drawing herself up   and rooting her
   little rear end into that chair that made you want to run for cover.
   Even in the waning moments of her 85 plus years, she could make my
   cousins jump up suddenly at her commands to fetch a tray for a
   visitor's bologna sandwich.

    I recall that my Uncle Don used to call her "Jaws."

   Uncle Don presented himself as a devil may care character as he
   swaggered around the rez, seemingly immune to responsibility and public
   criticism. I recall the time he went to mass Sunday morning, still
   swaying from his Saturday night celebration. He hadn't been to church
   since the Vatican II influenced changes in the service and was
   surprised when a man in a nearby pew shook his hand and gave him the
   blessing, "Peace be with you."

   "Well pleased to meet you too," he roared out good-naturedly in
   response.

   Haw, hawing for a long time and unashamed, he retold the story for days
   to approving audiences around the rez. Auntie Pat, however, took the
   opportunity to remind him of his family duties left undone. When he
   left her house, he looked several inches shorter and I noted that his
   rear end was nearly non-existent.

   All the Ojibwe women in my life share this fierce protective instinct
   surrounding family, culture and land. It is an instinct unbounded even
   by death. Although both my mother Bernice and Auntie Pat passed away in
   2011 within weeks of each other, I feel as though they've issued an
   order, one that is startling me, my cousins and all Ojibwe women into
   action.  That order is a reminder that in the Ojibwe worldview, women
   are the ones who care for the water and it is time for us to step up.

   For us, family and community include water, land and wildlife. We know,
   deep in our blood memories, that there is no escape from the natural
   processes that dominate our lives. No amount of money, jobs or
   political back room deals can buy off these forces. Ojibwe and
   non-Indians alike, rich and poor, Democrats and Republicans are all
   governed by the great leveler, nature. If we befoul our water, we
   poison ourselves. This is a simple fact that Ojibwe, especially women,
   understand.  We carry our young surrounded by water in our wombs; the
   power of water is etched in an unutterable place in our bodies, beyond
   words.

   Therefore,  when a good Christian church going woman like my cousin
   Marylu tells me she is ready to "sit on the mountain," I realize this
   is serious stuff. Like auntie Pat, the Ojibwe women have drawn
   themselves up and readied themselves to defend family.

   The mining interests better watch their rear ends.

[25]Sovereign Nation Status

   As shown by our governments current worldwide aggression, sovereign
   nation status means little to those in power wether industry or
   government.

   70 years ago there was another industry which offered jobs, timber.
   Once the resource is extracted those who remain pay the price and
   industry banks the income and moves to another area or even country.

   Throughout the world today indigenous and sovereign nations battle
   multinational extractive industries and the battle is not going well.
