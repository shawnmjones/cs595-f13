    Every week Daily Kos diarists write dozens of environmentally related
   posts. Many don't get the readership they deserve. Helping improve the
   odds is the motivation behind the Green Diary Rescue. In the past seven
      years, there have been 237 of these spotlighting more than 13,411
    eco-diaries. Below are categorized links and excerpts to 67 more that
    appeared in the past seven days. That makes for lots of good reading
    during the spare moments of your weekend. [Disclaimer: Inclusion of a
   diary in the rescue does not necessarily indicate my agreement with or
                             endorsement of it.]

   Green Diary of the Week

   This week it's a big shout-out to the 2000-3000 people who showed up at
   Chevron in Richmond, California on the one-year anniversary of the
   explosion and fire there.

   [29]Kitchen Table Kibitzing: 8/4/13 Prayer, Solidarity and Energy Take
   Over Chevron --by remembrance: "The three of us, Glen, TLO(TM) and I,
   went to Summer Heat to protest against Chevron on the one year
   anniversary of the leak that caused an explosion and fire sending about
   15,000 people to the hospital because of toxic fumes. Moms at local
   schools began Asthma clubs for children who were effected by the
   toxicity and whose education was impacted because of it. As it turns
   out, Chevron and other oil companies are beginning to import Canadian
   Tar Sands for processing in the Bay Area. This should come as no
   surprise. [...] When we arrived there were hundreds of long stemmed
   sunflowers arranged on circular benches in the courtyard where we met,
   provided by Urban Tilth. The sunflowers were meant for each of us to
   march with."

   [30]Summerheat: Arrests as 2000+ March to Richmond Climate Justice
   Rally--by boatsie: "Just returned from the Summer of Heat rally outside
   Chevron Refinery where hundreds volunteered to be arrested. An
   incredible day for Climate Justice."

   Some of the more than 2,000 protesters who showed up in Richmond,
   California, Aug. 3,  as part of the Summer of Heat to mark the one year
   anniversary of the Chevron fire.
   [31]Massive protest at California Chevron refinery a show of movement
   strength--by dturnbull: "This weekend, Oil Change International's
   newest campaigner and I joined dozens of dedicated community leaders,
   climate movement allies and friends, and a couple thousand new friends
   in a march to the Chevron refinery in Richmond, California. Our demands
   were simple: Stop polluting our community, wrecking our climate, and
   buying off our democracy. Following a rally outside the refinery gates
   that included speakers ranging from the Mayor of Richmond to local
   activists demanding an end to Chevron's toxic legacy, Matt and I joined
   200 others in walking onto Chevron's property and sitting in at their
   gates in an act of peaceful civil disobedience."

   Eco-Related DC & State Politics

   [32]Gov. Jerry Brown's Legacy--by RLMiller: "Brown says all the right
   things regarding climate change. His home page invites you to "join the
   call for action on climate change." And when a major new report lists
   all the ways climate change is already affecting California, he tweets:
   'Whether you live in California, Texas or Timbuktu, climate change is
   real, and it's long past time for action' That new report, compiled by
   Cal/EPA's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, lists 36
   indicators of climate change already occurring in California. A story
   notes that rising ocean waters, bigger and more frequent wildfires, and
   more brutally hot summer days are already here. These changes aren't
   just abstract predictions based on computer modeling, but rather
   observations - things happening right here, right now. Brown will point
   to many actions the state is taking to alleviate the worst impacts of
   climate change, with high speed rail as the centerpiece. Which makes
   his stance on fracking California even more puzzling. To him, fracking
   is a fabulous economic opportunity.'

   [33]Are You in Danger of a Preventable Chemical Plant Explosion?--by
   Phil Radford II Greenpeace: [President Obama issued an executive order
   to modernize regulation of chemical plant safety]: "At the same time
   that the president issued his Executive Order, Greenpeace and over 100
   groups such as United Auto Workers, the Sierra Club, UPROSE, Rebuild
   the Dream, Environmental Defense Fund, National Domestic Workers
   Alliance, National Peoples' Action, MoveOn, Los Jardines Institute, and
   Community In-Power and Development Association sent a jointly signed
   letter to the new EPA chief Gina McCarthy urging her to make chemical
   disaster prevention a priority in her first 100 days in office. The
   path forward couldn't be clearer, and the risks of continued inaction
   couldn't be higher."

   [34]OR-03: Support For Earl Blumenauer's (D) Bill To Save The Bees
   Grows In The House--by poopdogcomedy: "Received this e-mail today from
   Congressman Earl Blumenauer (D. OR-03) With some good news: Thank you
   for signing the petition supporting "The Save America's Pollinators
   Act." Your outpouring of support was amazing with over 310,000 of you
   lending your name to help me take this vital message to my colleagues
   in Congress. The legislation currently has 17 co-sponsors, a good first
   step!
   However, despite your passion and the importance of protecting
   pollinators to our food and ecosystems across the globe, passing this
   legislation will still be an uphill battle. Our best chance for saving
   bees from neonicotinoid chemicals is getting "The Save America's
   Pollinators Act" included in the reauthorization of the Farm Bill.
   While I work to convince my colleagues in Congress that protecting our
   economy and environment is tied to healthy bee populations, it's also
   vital for them to hear from you, their constituents, while they're back
   in their districts during the August work period. Let them know what
   the buzz is all about! Can you call your representative right now to
   demand that "The Save America's Pollinators Act" be included in the
   Farm Bill to protect pollinators?"

   [35]Time to say this: Republicans are destroying civilization--by VL
   Baker: "But there is nowhere the Republican failure is more devastating
   than in the global response to climate change. [...] In the over 30
   years of Republican political dominance, the evidence of anthropogenic
   climate change has only strengthened to the point that 97 percent of
   credible climate scientists support the overwhelming evidence of human
   caused climate change. Yet over that time the Republican/conservative
   response has been to use its power to misinform and to obstruct any
   progress to mitigate. The Republican political leaders have taken the
   side of their business buddies--the fossil fuel industry, who have
   rewarded them with obnoxious sums of money for their support which has
   assured them of unrivaled control of the energy market. In the 112th
   GOP-controlled congress alone there have been 317 votes taken against
   the environment."

   Climate Chaos
   Starved polar bear
   [36]The photo the Koch brothers really don't want you to see--by VL
   Baker: "Renowned polar bear expert Dr. Ian Stirling, who has studied
   the bears for almost 40 years, describes this polar bear found dead in
   Svalbard as "little more than skin and bones," having perished due to a
   lack of sea ice on which to hunt seals: 'From his lying position in
   death the bear appears to simply have starved and died where he
   dropped,' Stirling said. 'He had no external suggestion of any
   remaining fat, having been reduced to little more than skin and bone.'
   The bear had been examined by scientists from the Norwegian Polar
   Institute in April in the southern part of Svalbard, an Arctic island
   archipelago, and appeared healthy. The same bear had been captured in
   the same area in previous years, suggesting that the discovery of its
   body, 250km away in northern Svalbard in July, represented an unusual
   movement away from its normal range. [...] This is what the Koch
   brothers' business model is producing. The Koch PAC is the largest oil
   and gas contributor--donating more than even ExxonMobil. Koch
   Industries sends 90 percent of these contributions to Republicans."

   [37]As Arctic village disappears beneath sea, more fossil fuels being
   found--by Warren Swil: "Two recent stories from opposite sides of the
   Arctic circle demonstrate that climate changes is not only happening
   right now with devastating effects, but that we - human beings - are
   making it worse, not better. One is about the village of Kivalina, a
   tiny hamlet that is disappearing as the ocean rises - an affect of
   climate change. The Alaskan village set to disappear under water in a
   decade The other is about a new, high-tech giant machine developed in
   Norway to extract more gas from a field once thought exhausted. Giant
   gas platform sinks below waves."

   [38]Addressing Environmental Racism Linked to Climate Change Impacts
   Happening Now in California--by Patriot Daily News Clearinghouse:
   "California's Department of Environmental Protection issued a new
   report today on the 'Indicators of Climate Change in California.' The
   'indicators' are the 'large amounts of scientific data' collected by
   monitoring and research activities by state and federal agencies,
   universities and other research institutions. This report makes it
   clear that 'climate change is not just some abstract scientific debate.
   It's real, and it's already here.'"

   [39]Michael Klare, How to Fry a Planet--by TomDispatch: "Look at it any
   way you want, and if you're not a booster of fossil fuels on this
   overheating planet of ours, it doesn't look good. Hardly a  month
   passes, it seems, without news about the development of some
   previously unimaginable way to extract fossil fuels from some
   thoroughly unexpected place. The latest bit of 'good' news: the
   Japanese  government's announcement that natural gas has been
   successfully extracted from undersea methane hydrates. (Yippee!)
   Natural gas is gleefully touted as the 'clean' fossil-fuel path to a
   green future, but evidence is mounting that the newest process for
   producing it also leaks unexpected amounts of methane, a devastating
   greenhouse gas. The U.S. cheers and is cheered because the amount of
   carbon dioxide it is putting into the atmosphere is actually falling.
   Then Duncan Clark at the British Guardian does the figures and
   discovers that 'there has been no decline in the amount of carbon the
   U.S. is taking out of the ground. In fact,  the trend is upwards. The
   latest year for which full data is available--2011--is the highest
   level on record.' It's just that some of it  (coal, in particular) was
   exported abroad to be burned elsewhere."

   [40]Could Drought-resistant Desert Plants mitigate Climate Change?--by
   jamess: "Some very smart "rocket scientists" seem to think so. As cited
   on NASA's Global Climate Change page: As the world starts feeling the
   effects of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and consequent global
   temperature rise, researchers are looking for a Plan B to mitigate
   climate change. A group of German scientists has now come up with an
   environmentally friendly method that they say could do just that. The
   technique, dubbed carbon farming, consists in planting trees in arid
   regions on a large scale to capture CO2. They publish their study today
   in Earth System Dynamics, a journal of the European Geosciences Union
   (EGU).

   [41]Want to solve Climate Change? Think Different--by xaxnar: "The
   title of today's offering is riffing off an ad slogan that probably
   still has some resonance, whether or not you like the products of the
   company. You could take it as a really concise corollary to the quote
   attributed to Einstein: 'Insanity: doing the same thing over and over
   again and expecting different results.' The ITER program is a classic
   brute force approach to the problem of energy, based on what is the
   traditional mainstream line of attack on the fusion problem--the
   tokamak. It has provided a steady living for generations of physicists
   and engineers, even if that approach hasn't panned out yet. (If you
   followed the links in my diary yesterday or even did a quick web
   search, you'd find there are a number of other fusion concepts being
   explored.)"
   Climate activists
   [42]HOLY REALITY CHECK!!! Former Republican Heads of EPA on climate
   change: Don't deny, Don't delay --by citisven: "Hell is indeed freezing
   over and angels are dancing and popping corks everywhere. In an August
   1st op-ed in the New York Times, former administrators of the
   Environmental Protection Agency William D. Ruckelshaus (1970 to 1973,
   1983 to 1985), Lee M. Thomas (1985 to 1989), William K. Reilly (1989 to
   1993), and Christine Todd Whitman (2001 to 2003) make the Republican
   Case for Climate Action. First, they say denial is not a river in Egypt
   and it's time for Republicans to stop acting like stubborn 15-year olds
   clinging to their belief in Santa Claus."

   [43]Want to Solve Climate Change? Solve Energy--by xaxnar: "While
   Europe has been struggling with really bad economic policies and their
   own unemployment problems, they've still managed to forge ahead on an
   experimental energy project that rivals Apollo or the Manhattan
   Project: ITER. It's a multinational project to build a working
   thermonuclear reactor that will use nuclear fusion to generate power.
   To date no one has succeeded in building a reactor that can do it
   without consuming more power than the reactor creates. ITER hopes to be
   the first to reach "break even" and go beyond. Nuclear fusion, if done
   right, does not need highly radioactive and dangerous fuel, does not
   produce dangerously radioactive waste, or green house gasses. It does
   not risk a China Syndrome meltdown, a Chernobyl, or a Fukushima. The
   fuel is readily available and cheap. It's a big if--but the potential
   rewards are huge."

   [44]Developing Polar Storm Could Last 2 Weeks Destroying Arctic Sea
   Ice--by FishOutofWater: "Arctic sea ice area has made an astonishing
   recovery in the early summer of 2013 compared to 2012. However, there
   is one thing holding back a sustained recovery. The ice is spread very
   thin. Last summer's record melt left very little thick multi-year ice.
   Last winter's thin first year ice has been spread, like a layer of
   slush, across much of the Arctic ocean And now a strong storm is
   brewing that the GFS model predicts will stir the slushy waters for the
   next two weeks. Moreover, there is a large area of much warmer than
   normal water on the Atlantic side of the Arctic ocean. That warm salty
   water will be driven into the Arctic by the southerly winds blowing up
   along the coast of Norway."

   Food, Agriculture & Gardening

   [45]Farmers Win Major Protection Against Monsanto GMO Infringement
   Lawsuits--by pajoly: "Jim Gerritsen, a Maine farmer and the president
   of the Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association, announced in a
   public letter today that American farmers have secured a major victory
   in the battle against behemoth Monsanto. ...the Court ordered
   Monsanto...to NOT sue farmers for patent infringement should they
   encounter trace GE contamination. The estoppel protects EVERY farmer in
   the United States - not just those in our Plaintiff group. So American
   farmers for the first time in history have gained a new critical legal
   protection. As a result, farmers now may choose to sue Monsanto to
   recover damages in a contamination incident without the fear of being
   inflicted with a counter suit asserting patent infringement.It is
   wonderful news. The policy of Monsanto suing farmers for patent
   infringement because Monsanto's own GMO contaminated their seeds has
   struck me as incredibly evil and an egregious example of America, Inc.
   using its bulk and wealth to destroy farmers."
   [46]Food Security: Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is--by boatsie: "An
   unsustainable reliance on fossil fuels is emerging as what might be the
   proverbial straw that breaks the back of an already severely insecure
   global food system which faces overwhelming challenges from runaway
   population growth, uncontrolled climate change, and extreme and
   unpredictable weather. In a report issued last month, the UN appointed
   panel which was assembled to frame, quantify and qualify the post Rio
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasized the intricate link
   between the health of the environment and the innate needs of a healthy
   human population for sustainable energy, water, food, and natural
   resources. The Post 2015 Agenda, which replaces the eight Millennium
   Development Goals with 12 SDGs targets a daunting 54 issues, while
   specifying that addressing food security, climate change and the rapid
   depletion of natural resources are tantamount to adequately meet the
   global nature of both the economy and ecology of the plane"

   [47]An End to Dead Zones?--by johnniec: "It looks like there has been a
   potential breakthrough on nitrogen fixation in crops. Researchers in
   England claim that simply by coating crop seeds in a certain species of
   nitrogen fixing bacteria, those plants will gain the ability to fix
   nitrogen in their roots. If true, this could reduce or eliminate the
   need for nitrogen fertilizers which through their lifecycle, from
   creation to final fate in the environment, are a major source of water
   and air pollution. Hedging again here, if true, this could mean great
   things for multiple fisheries around the world. The main example of
   dead zones we learn about in the US is the one at the mouth of the
   Mississippi River, but there are many more along our coasts and around
   the world."

   [48]Macca's Meatless Monday:You say tomato, I say tomatoe--by VL Baker:
   "Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 2.5 Pounds. Each time you have a plant-based
   lunch like a PB&J you'll reduce your carbon footprint by the equivalent
   of 2.5 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions over an average animal-based
   lunch like a hamburger, a tuna sandwich, grilled cheese, or chicken
   nuggets. For dinner you save 2.8 pounds and for breakfast 2.0 pounds of
   emissions. If you have a PB&J instead of a red-meat lunch like a ham
   sandwich or a hamburger, you shrink your carbon footprint by almost 3.5
   pounds of greenhouse gas emissions."

   [49]* New Day * -- Could You Become a Part-Time Vegan for the
   Planet?--by smileycreek: "Ever since my 20's I've found it fun to
   experiment with just about every diet approach out there, from the
   perfectly awful Natural Hygienic all raw foods diet to the perfectly
   awful super low-carb heavy-on-animal products Atkins diet. It's clear
   I'll never be a total vegetarian. I don't like extremes and there are
   times I crave meat, fish, and especially cheese, though the older I get
   the more I move in a vegan direction. Recently I found an outstanding
   book I've been recommending to my patients that lays out a flexible
   food philosophy I believe anyone can benefit from and work with. Mark
   Bittman, food writer for the New York Times Magazine and author of Food
   Matters, which explains how the standard American diet harms the
   environment, has come up with a simple, flexible philosophical plan
   anyone can adapt: Become a Part-Time Vegan."

   [50]OR-03: Support For Earl Blumenauer's (D) Bill To Save The Bees
   Grows In The House--by poopdogcomedy: "Received this e-mail today from

   [51]Disgusting #USDAfail: Poop & Bleach on Food, OK--by
   InterfaithWorkerJustice: "August is Clean & Safe Chicken Month. Ok, we
   made that up but we can win a small but meaningful victory. Clean and
   Safe Chicken is achievable - this month, before the USDA implements a
   terrible new rule. Please help. The USDA plans to "modernize" chicken
   production by: 1. eliminating 75% of USDA inspectors and permitting
   corporations to police themselves, using untrained employees; 2.
   speeding up production lines so it's not possible to inspect and remove
   chickens contaminated with poop, pus, scabs, and rotten flesh; 3.
   assuming contamination, so all birds will be washed with chlorine.
   Spend a couple of minutes to support workers, protect our food supply,
   and take a stand against de-regulation."

   [52]USDA Subsidizes California Grower's Fight Against Coastal
   Whales--by LeftOfYou: "Between 1995 and 2012, Coburn Ranch of Dos
   Palos, California, raked in $5,558,358.28 in federal farm subsidies,
   mostly commodity price support payments. BTW, that placed this poor
   struggling family agribusiness in the No. 2 slot of the 642 recipients
   of such government payments (dare I say, entitlements) in Coburn
   Ranch's zip code in the California Central Valley. Coburn Ranch knows
   how to use a little extra spending money when they get their hands on
   it: Pick a fight with a fish, and lose. That sounds like an excellent
   use of federal funds. /snark."

   [53]Saturday Morning Garden Blogging Vol. 9.25--by blue jersey mom:
   "Good morning, gardeners. As some of you probably know, blue jersey dad
   and I spent about two and a half months in the field this summer, doing
   archaeological work in Hawai'i and then in the Middle East. This was
   not good for our garden. We had three days between the time we arrived
   home from Hawai'i and the time we had to leave for Ukraine. It gave us
   just about enough time to do our laundry, mow the grass in the front of
   the house, collect our Turkish research visas, repack, and get back to
   JFK."

   Energy

   [54]Global Finance Saying No to New Coal Power Plants--by TomP: "First
   it was President Barack Obama pledging in June that the government
   would no longer finance overseas coal plants through the U.S.
   Export-Import Bank. Next it was the World Bank, then the European
   Investment Bank, dropping support for coal projects. Those banks have
   pumped more than $10 billion into such initiatives in the past five
   years. 'Drawing back means there is less capital for these projects,'
   Richard Caperton, managing director for energy at the Center for
   American Progress in Washington, said in an interview. 'I don't expect
   private capital to move in and fill the void, either, because there is
   a real risk that these plants will be turned off early.'"

   [55]"Everything is Connected" - The People vs. Coal Exports in the
   Northwest--by Mary Anne Hitt: "In recent days, there were new
   developments in the fight against Northwest coal exports that stopped
   me in my tracks. Last week, the news broke that the official review of
   the largest proposed coal export terminal in Washington State will be
   unprecedented in scope, and will include not only the health and
   environmental effects of the project, but also the climate impacts of
   burning the coal in Asia. This announcement by the U.S. Army Corps of
   Engineers, the Washington State Department of Ecology, and Whatcom
   County comes after a blockbuster comment period on the project, where
   10,000 people attended standing-room-only public hearings and more than
   120,000 submitted written comments."

   [56]Iowa's Campaign to Stop Nuclear Power--by Paul Deaton: "Prepared
   remarks delivered by Paul Deaton at the Iowa City Public Library on the
   68th Anniversary of Hiroshima, Aug. 6, 2013--In February 2010, I wrote
   the first of a long series of posts on Blog for Iowa about what I
   believed to be the legislature's infatuation with nuclear power during
   the last four sessions of the Iowa General Assembly. I wrote, "I heard
   the words 'zero sum gain' applied to MidAmerican Energy's process
   toward change for the first time. It seems to fit. A zero sum gain is a
   situation in which a participant's gain or loss is exactly balanced by
   the losses or gains of the other participant(s). If the state wants to
   move forward with nuclear power, it's okay with MidAmerican Energy, but
   they are a business, so the customers will have to pay." The customers
   will have to pay. That pretty much sums it up. What's missing is no one
   knew how much a new nuclear power plant would cost, then, or now. For
   this and other reasons, the people of Iowa decided there were better
   ways to generate electricity."

   [57]The Contango Game: How Koch Industries Manipulates The Oil Market
   For Profit--by War on Error: "From Inventing Oil Derivatives To
   Deregulating The Market--How Koch Became An Oil Speculation
   Powerhouse--In fact, Koch pioneered the risky speculation industry that
   dominates the world's oil markets today, first by inventing oil
   derivatives back in the '80s, then by working to kill off regulations.
   ThinkProgress has delved into the history of Koch's oil speculation
   business and the following timeline spells out Koch's leading role."

   Renewables

   [59]Feds take one step closer to establishing 17 new "Solar Energy
   Zones" on Public Lands--by jamess: Federal officials have taken another
   step toward establishing 17 new "solar energy zones" on public lands in
   the West by barring new mining claims that could impede renewable
   energy development on the sites. [...] Hmmm?  Maybe folks could learn
   to "mine" the Sun, instead?"

   [60]You've heard about Price Per Gallon -- could be time to school up
   on Price Per Watt--by jamess: "Nearly everyone 'frets about' the price
   of the gallon of gas.  Isn't about time we became equally 'engaged'
   about the price of a kilowatt-hour of electricity? Especially if you're
   at all interested in the affordability of those Solar-generated
   kilowatts ...The upshot (see chart) is that the modules used to make
   solar-power plants now cost less than a dollar per watt of capacity.
   Power-station construction costs can add $4 to that, but these, too,
   are falling as builders work out how to do the job better. And running
   a solar power station is cheap because the fuel is free. Coal-fired
   plants, for comparison, cost about $3 a watt to build in the United
   States, and natural-gas plants cost $1. But that is before the fuel to
   run them is bought."

   [61]DOE: U.S. Wind Energy Production and Manufacturing Reaches Record
   Highs--by Magnifico: "Wind energy is now the fastest growing source of
   power in the United States - representing 43 percent of all new U.S.
   electric generation capacity in 2012 and $25 billion in new investment
   ... In the first four years of the Obama Administration, American
   electricity generation from wind and solar power more than doubled.
   This upbeat assessment comes from the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE),
   which released two new reports on America's wind energy production and
   manufacturing. Nine states rely on wind power for more than 12 percent
   of their annual energy consumption, with Iowa, Kansas, and South Dakota
   exceeding a 20 percent share. For the past two years, 'the price of
   wind under long-term power purchase contracts averaged just 4¢ per
   kilowatt hour.'"

   [62]ALEC takes a 13-0 beating in fossil-fueled effort to gut states'

   the states have established renewable energy standards. That rises to
   three-fourths when renewable energy goals are included. The standards
   mandate how much electricity utility companies, including municipally
   owned utilities, must generate by a certain date from solar, wind,
   geothermal, hydro, biomass and other renewable sources. And the folks
   at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), who are
   celebrating their 40th birthday at the group's annual convention in
   Chicago this week, worked in their usual behind-the-scenes way in the
   past seven months to dump those standards. They failed. Not just once.
   But in every state where they attacked."

   Fracking

   [63]NOAA Investigation Finds Massive Methane Emissions from Utah
   Fracking: 6% to 12% Lost to Atmosphere--by FishOutofWater: "Thousands
   of gas wells have been drilled in Utah's Uintah basin. An investigation
   by NOAA & CIRES found that 6% to 12% of the gas produced near Ouray (by
   hydrofracturing) escaped to the atmosphere raising methane
   concentrations in air to shockingly high levels. On a perfect winter
   day in 2012 NOAA and CIRES scientists sent up a sampling plane to
   determine the methane levels and the quantity of methane released from
   oil and gas production activities in the Uintah basin in Utah. The
   scientists found far more methane than anyone had anticipated. Methane
   levels downwind peaked at the stunningly high level of 2080 parts per
   billion. [...]  Assertions that natural gas from fracking has a lower
   greenhouse gas impact than conventional sweet crude are just not true.
   Atmospheric scientists will continue to investigate the complexities of
   release of natural gasses from gas wells developed by hydraulic
   fracturing, but it is now clear that industry estimates of gas
   emissions are far below realistic values. The EPA is also using gas
   emissions values that are far below the levels measured by the NOAA
   CIRES research team."

   number of wells.
   [64]Royal Dutch Shell: They've Really Got a Friend in Pennsylvania--by
   brasch: "Royal Dutch Shell, which owns or leases about 900,000 acres in
   the Marcellus Shale, had a great idea. It wanted to frack the Ukraine.
   But, there was opposition. So, Royal Dutch Shell decided to create a
   junket for some of the Ukrainians opposed to fracking to show them just
   how wonderful fracking is. [...] Now, the people of the Ukraine
   anti-fracking movement aren't idiots. They weren't just going to take
   whatever they were shown and told. So, they contacted the state's
   leading fractivists and anti-fracking organizations. They wanted to
   learn all the facts--not just what was spoon-fed to them. They were
   willing to talk to anti-fracking activists when there were no other
   scheduled activities. But Royal Dutch Shell was monitoring FaceBook and
   the Internet, and saw that the Ukrainians were trying to talk to the
   grassroots movement in Pennsylvania to get all sides of the issue."

   [65]Exclusive: Censored EPA Pennsylvania Fracking Water Contamination
   Presentation Published--by Steve Horn: "DeSmogBlog has obtained a copy
   of an Obama Administration Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   fracking groundwater contamination PowerPoint presentation describing a
   then-forthcoming study's findings in Dimock, Pennsylvania. The
   PowerPoint presentation reveals a clear link between hydraulic
   fracturing ('fracking') for shale gas in Dimock and groundwater
   contamination, but was censored by the Obama Administration. Instead,
   the EPA issued an official desk statement in July 2012 - in the thick
   of election year - saying the water in Dimock was safe for consumption.
   Titled 'Isotech-Stable Isotype Analysis: Determinining the Origin of
   Methane and Its Effects on the Aquifer,' the PowerPoint presentation
   concludes that in Cabot Oil and Gas' Dimock Gesford 2 well, 'Drilling
   creates pathways, either temporary or permanent, that allows gas to
   migrate to the shallow aquifer near [the] surface...In some cases,
   these gases disrupt groundwater quality.'"

   [66]Is CBS Pitt Shilling for Natural Gas Drilling?--by S Kitchen: "From
   the bullsh*t propaganda department: on August 15th, CBS Radio's
   Pittsburgh cluster (KDKA-AM, KDKA-FM, WDSY-FM, and WBZZ-FM) will 'host'
   the Marcellus Shale Festival at an outdoor music venue in town. This is
   an event wholly designed to put a happy face on the practice of
   hydraulic fracturing: the messy process of harvesting natural gas
   that's spreading throughout the country. The Marcellus Shale Formation
   extends throughout seven states and is currently one of the most active
   areas of hydraulic fracturing in the continental United States. In many
   respects, Pennsylvania has been the ground zero of Marcellus fracking,
   where wells have been operating since 2005."

   [67]The Ocean Frackers--by Dan Bacher: "Some may consider California to
   be a "green" state and the "environmental leader" of the nation, but
   that delusion is quickly dispelled once one actually looks at who
   spends the most on lobbying in California - the oil industry. The
   Western States Petroleum Association spent the most on lobbying in
   Sacramento in the first six months of 2013 of any interest group,
   according to quarterly documents released by the California Secretary
   of State. The association spent $1,023,069.78 in the first quarter and
   $1,285,720.17 in the second quarter, a total of $2,308,789.95, to lobby
   legislators and other state officials."

   [68]INSANITY: Children "banned for life" from talking about fracking as
   part of settlement!--by Brainwrap: "Two children aged 7 and 10 have
   been banned from talking about fracking for the rest of their lives.
   It's part of a settlement received by their parents, who were awarded
   $750,000 from drilling company Range Resources to help them move from
   their fracking-polluted home in Washington County, PA. [Subsequently,
   Range Resources said that the kids could say whatever they wish now and
   when they are of age.] "

   [69]State Dept. now investigating itself on Keystone XL pipeline
   tainted environmental review--by VL Baker: "Amazing news from the State
   Department that its own internal watchdog unit has plans to initiate an
   inquiry on, wait for it, its own environmental review of the Keystone
   XL pipeline. [...] This new development raises the possibility of
   another redo of the analysis assessing Keystone's environmental impact
   and can only give opponents of the pipeline some optimism especially as
   this comes after President Obama's recent comments that he'd oppose the
   pipeline if it 'significantly exacerbates' carbon pollution."

   [70]America's dangerous pipelines: Haven't we had enough, Mr.
   President?--by VL Baker: "The Center for Biological Diversity  has
   compiled a new analysis of oil and gas pipeline safety in the United
   States which reveals a troubling history of spills, contamination,
   injuries and deaths. [...]  According to the data, since 1986 there
   have been nearly 8,000 incidents (nearly 300 per year on average),
   resulting in more than 500 deaths (red dots on the video), more than
   2,300 injuries (yellow dots on the video), and nearly $7 billion in
   damage."

   [71]A Few Questions on the New IHS CERA Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline
   Report--by lowkell: "A new report by IHS CERA Insight, entitled
   "KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE: NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON US GHG EMISSIONS," has
   been getting a good deal of attention for its bottom line conclusions
   that a) tar sands production growth is not dependent on construction of
   the Keystone XL tar sands export pipeline; and b) that the Keystone XL
   pipeline will not lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions. But are
   these conclusion accurate? We looked into the report, and came up with
   a number of questions we'd very much love to have answered promptly by
   IHS CERA. * Should we be at all concerned that a previous report by IHS
   CERA on "The Role of Canadian Oil Sands in US Oil Supply" claimed "to
   offer an independent assessment of the potential role of Canadian oil
   sands in future US oil supply," yet has a list of "report participants
   and reviewers" that includes almost exclusively those with vested
   interests in developing Canadian tar sands (e.g., the Alberta
   Department of Energy, the American Petroleum Institute, the Canadian
   Oil Sands Trust, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers,
   Conoco Phillips, Devon Energy, Marathon, Statoil Canada, Suncor, and
   TransCanada itself)?"

   [72]Fracking's Myriad Ties to Greenwashed State Dept Keystone XL
   Environmental Review--by Steve Horn: "Most don't think of hydraulic
   fracturing ("fracking") when pondering the future of TransCanada's
   Keystone XL tar sands export pipeline - but they should. There are
   numerous ties between key members of the fracking industry and groups
   pushing for approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. And these threads all
   lead back, one way or another, to Environmental Resources Management,
   Inc. (ERM Group). The ties that bind raise even more questions about
   the legitimacy of the State Department's contracted out environmental
   review."

   The Great Outdoors

   [73]n The Trail of Cedars - Glacier National Park and the never-ending
   meet-up diaries (photos)--by figbash: "Once upon a time, so long ago
   that it might be said that it has almost been lost in the mists of
   time, there was an EPIC meet-up of Kossacks in Glacier National Park.
   There were Kossacks from Delaware, from Oregon and Montana, from
   Colorado and Arizona, from Illinois and, of course, from California. It
   was so epic you might never hear the end of it. In fact, there could be
   8 million stories told (so I exaggerate) about this meet-up. This is
   just one of them. On Saturday morning the able-bodied Kossacks just
   couldn't wait to head off on the four-and-one-half mile trail to
   Avalanche Lake. That left jakedog42 and me, figbash, with our pitifully
   under-perfoming spinal colums to strike out on our own. Wait.... what?
    This looks like a good idea and since the wise and beautiful Sea of
   Confusion recommended it, we couldn't wait to check it out.  Trail of
   the Cedars sounds awfully good to me and it's a boardwalk... with
   benches. We can do this."

   [74]The Daily Bucket: After the Fact Bucket Lists--by matching mole:
   "So I started this diary with the idea of asking people what would be
   on their natural history bucket list. And while that is a fun thing to
   contemplate, something else came to mind. What is something that got
   added to your bucket list only after you experienced it?  Something
   that you wouldn't have thought about beforehand but after the
   experience was something really meaningful? A recent example for me,
   which I diaried here, was my observation of the insect life associated
   with fungi on a rotting tree in our yard. The miniature ecosystem was
   fascinating and really made my day for several days in a row."

   [75]What do you take in your hiking day pack?--by ban nock: "The
   walking was softer on the slushy ice but my boots aren't new and I was
   getting leakage. There were many other people on the trail, all of us
   walking as quickly as we could to get down. Down out of the cold air,
   out of the icy slush. I noticed less than half of the people even had a
   rain coat. I was the only person wearing boots, everyone had some sort
   of hiking sneakers that everyone wears now. People's feet were very
   cold and wet. Many were wet all over, but walking fast no shivering. I
   looked carefully at everyone I saw, prepared to give my coat and
   sweater to anyone dangerously cold. In those conditions any accident
   could turn serious very quickly. I was amazed at how unprepared most
   people were despite hundreds of dollars in hydration systems, and GPSs,
   and competitive mountain running shoes, and trekking poles, and god
   knows what else. If they'd just thrown a plastic trash bag in their
   packs they'd of been able to pull it over themselves,  poke a hole for
   their head, and be dry. Plastic ponchos cost a coupla bucks.I guess I'm
   over prepared. I can last a night out if uncomfortably."

   Critters

   [76]FWS Purges Gray Wolf Peer Review Panel--by SphericalXS: "The U.S.
   Fish and Wildlife Service has decided to stack the deck against gray
   wolf recovery by disqualifying many of the nation's leading wolf
   researchers from participating in the scientific peer review process of
   a proposal to delist the gray wolf as a protected species throughout
   most of the United States. Three of the nation's top wolf experts have
   been excluded from the scientific peer review of the plan to remove
   federal protections from the gray wolf on orders from the U.S. Dept. of
   Interior-Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS). The scientists were barred
   because they had signed a letter with 13 other scientists expressing
   concern about the scientific basis for the federal plan, according to
   Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER)."

   [77]Why Do These People Hate Sea Otters--by LeftOfYou: "Why have these
   cuties been dragged into court by the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF),
   an anti-Obamacare litigant and backer of other Tea Party legal wet
   dreams? According to the LA Times: Commercial fishermen have filed a
   lawsuit in federal court challenging the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
   for abandoning a program to create an 'otter-free zone' in Southern
   California coastal waters that sustain shellfish industries.The
   lawsuit, filed this week by the Pacific Legal Foundation on behalf of
   harvesters of sea urchin, abalone and lobster south of Point
   Conception, accuses the agency of illegally terminating the program
   without congressional approval or authorization. Do you know what an
   "otter-free zone" is? Me either before I stumbled across this story and
   dug deeper. I was more than a little gobsmacked by what I found."

   [78]The Daily Bucket: Tern Tern Tern Again--by PHScott: "These photos
   of Caspian terns diving were taken a few weeks ago when the terns were
   more active. Now we only see 1 a day or so. Getting near time for them
   to move on South, so maybe I'll see them at the Florida coast later
   this fall. From the NY Natural Heritage Program website: 'The first
   known nesting of Caspian Terns in New York occurred in 1986 and the
   species is therefore recently new to the state.  ... The maximum number
   of nests was 1788 in 2005 and has declined to 1376 in 2008 after an
   outbreak of type E botulism in 2006. Caspian Terns that breed in the
   northeast and Great Lakes region begin arriving at their breeding
   grounds soon after ice break-up, usually in April. Peak nesting occurs
   late May to mid June, with chicks hatching in July to early August.
   Adults and young begin to migrate to wintering grounds mid to late
   August and are at their wintering areas by mid-November.'"

   [79]The Daily Bucket - small threatened slithering things--by Polly
   Syllabic: "At first we were startled and then we met shyly, eye-to-eye,
   on the first sunny day of spring. Fresh out of hibernation and our
   winter shelters we were both basking in the warmth of the unfamiliar.
   Its delicate tongue-flicks were as numerous as my camera clicks. We
   spent a short moment in the backyard regarding each other until it
   slipped away towards the wet meadow in search of juicey earthworms. We
   haven't seen each other since. In 1997, the Butler's garter snake was
   placed on the Wisconsin Endangered and Threatened Species List to
   protect it from habitat loss by the encroachment of real estate
   development. Its habitat was shrinking and the distinct population was
   declining and growing more fragmented."
   Black Oystercatcher
   Black Oystercatcher
   [80]Dawn Chorus: mmmm.... Oysters!--by lineatus: "It's kind of an odd
   name.  I mean, there's not much to "catching" an oyster - it's not like
   they're going anywhere.  Oysterhunter would make more sense, but I
   digress. Oystercatchers are large-ish shorebirds who make their living,
   for the most part, by prying and smashing mollusks with their awesome
   orange bills. They will also eat other creatures found along the shore,
   but are not typically fish eaters. Here in North America, we have two
   species of oystercatcher, American (found on the east and Gulf coasts,
   and on the west coast of Mexico) and Black (found on the west coast.)
   They prefer rocky coastal areas because that supports the mollusks they
   prefer and provides good breeding spots. If you look at their eastern
   range, there's a gap along the Louisiana coast and another at southern
   Florida. Presumably the marshy areas and sandy beaches in those
   locations doesn't give them what they need."

   [81]The Daily Bucket: old pond, summer afternoon--by OceanDiver:
   "Pacific Northwest: I was a small child when this pond was dug, in what
   was then rural western Washington over half a century ago, so it's old
   to me. And old enough to have an established community of residents and
   transients, some of which I enjoyed a couple of weeks ago, on a warm
   afternoon. The occasion was a gathering of family and friends, and
   while most folks were playing a brushy game of high-grass baseball in
   the field beyond, some of us were poking around beside the pond. The
   usual ducks and swallows had decamped, but invertebrates were oblivious
   to the human activity, busy at their own. Several Eight-Spotted
   Skimmers (Libellula forensis) flew in circles around each other,
   occasionally alighting for a rest. Here's a male. These skippers, named
   for the 8 black spots on their wings, are common in muddy bottomed
   ponds and lakes of the western U.S. As adults they feed on soft-bodied
   flying insects like mosquitoes, flies, moths, butterflies and
   termites."

   [82]The Daily Bucket - a Different View of Yellowstone--by Milly Watt:
   "The usual images conjured up of Yellowstone National Park are big ones
   - large wildlife like bison, elk, grizzly bear, and wolves; amazing
   geology like geysers, hot pots, the caldera of a super-volcano, and the
   grand canyon of the Yellowstone river; historic buildings like the Old
   Faithful Inn; the huge wildfires of 1988; and, of course, massive
   crowds of tourists in the summer months. The Old Faithful area was my
   backyard when I worked summers in the park during my college years. I
   recently went back for a visit and I was amazed at all the smaller
   details that I never noticed before. So, let me take you on a tour of
   the often overlooked nature in Yellowstone. Yeah, sure, Old Faithful is
   going off again - but, wow, look over here at this dragonfly! These
   insects are very common, hovering over the Firehole River.  In flight,
   they look entirely rust-colored.  I didn't see the clear ends of the
   wings until one settled down near me on a log.  They are feisty and
   chase each other aggressively. I believe that this is a Flame skimmer
   (Libellula saturata).

   Eco-Activism & Eco-Justice

   [84]DK's 'Reject Keystone XL' Campaign Stronger If Updated w/President
   Obama's Key Points--by Patriot Daily News Clearinghouse: "The upshot is
   that President Obama acknowledges that the GOP's economic arguments
   used to support the XL Pipeline are bogus on jobs, energy security, and
   gas prices. President Obama acknowledged that the U.S. is merely
   functioning as an oil bridge from Canada to world markets. This means
   that the U.S. will also get stuck with irreparable damage to our
   natural resources and wildlife and all the other harms flowing to
   people and earth when the XL leaks or spills. The DK campaign letter to
   President Obama would be far more effective and stronger if it were
   updated to include President Obama's statements regarding jobs, energy
   security and gas prices that may all be considered in the upcoming
   national interest determination on whether this pipeline should be
   rejected. President Obama presented a clear case to knock down the TC
   and GOP BS, and we should let him know that we support his words and
   expect him to do the same."

   Pollution, Hazardous Wastes & Trash

   [86]Radioactive water from Fukushima spilling into Pacific ocean--by
   Jen Hayden: "Japan's nuclear watchdog says there is a new state of
   emergency: An official from the Nuclear Regulation Authority says
   contaminated groundwater has risen above a shore barrier meant to
   contain it and is seeping into the Pacific Ocean. Speaking to the
   Reuters news agency, Shinji Kinjo revealed the leak is exceeding legal
   limits of radioactive discharge.
   Countermeasures planned by Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), the
   operator of the Fukushima nuclear complex, are only a temporary
   solution, Mr Kinjo added. 'Right now, we have an emergency,' he said."

   [87]Fukushima: Tepco, Destroyer of Worlds--by Yasuragi: "On July 18,
   the residents of Fukushima prefecture posted a statement: From the
   residents of Fukushima Prefecture. Please be noted that we, residents
   of Fukushima Shirakawa district (southern part of Fukushima prefecture)
   will perform action against the Ministry of Environment's burning
   project of highly contaminated radioactive waste (more than 8000 Bq/kg)
   on 18th July, here in Samegawa. Fukushima Disaster is not over, but the
   Ministry of Environment (MOE) is trying to bring another contamination
   plan all over the world."

   [88]That "Slight Leak" at Fukushima--by Joieau: "It has been nearly two
   and a half years since 4 of the 6 nuclear plants at TEPCO's Fukushima
   Daiichi reservation were destroyed following the March 11, 2011
   earthquake and tsunami. Yesterday the New York Times reported that
   about 650,000 gallons a week [400 tons per day] of highly contaminated
   water is flowing into the Pacific Ocean from the reservation.
   Regulators with Japan's version of the NRC express concern about
   TEPCO's inability to stop the flow, and do not know when the leak began
   (estimates go from December through May) or even where it's coming
   from. Obviously this highlights an issue Japanese officials have with
   TEPCO's longstanding corporate inability to tell the truth about much
   of anything, which led earlier this week to a request from officials of
   Fukushima prefecture that Japan's central government remove TEPCO from
   its management of the disaster due to its inability to contain the
   mess."

   [89]BP's Criminal Conduct Damages the Entire World--by Ring of Fire:
   "Last month, BP announced that its claim-compensation fund, intended to
   pay for claims filed by businesses and individuals affected by the 2010
   oil spill, is running dry; claims that they are required by law to pay.
   Even more recently, BP claimed that it has 'uncovered new allegations
   of fraud and conflicts of interest' in regards to the claims filed, an
   extension of similar allegations the company made earlier this year. BP
   requested that settlement payments be suspended temporarily so that a
   former FBI director could investigate the settlement program. A similar
   request was thrown out by a federal judge last month."

   [90]Sunday Train: The Triboro RX & the G Train to the Brooklyn Army
   Terminal--by BruceMcF: "While the Triboro RX plan was first introduced
   in a Regional Plan Association study in 1996, it was injected into this
   year's NYC Mayoral Race back in April of last year by Manhattan Borough
   President and Mayoral Candidate Scott Springer: Scott Stringer: NYC
   needs a commuter tax, new 'X' subway line: Stringer said the next big
   transit projects should include adding an AirTrain to LaGuardia Airport
   and adding a subway route--he called it the "X" line--to connect
   Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The Regional Plan Association first
   floated the idea in 1996, according to Jeffrey Zupan, a senior
   transportation fellow for the group.This is what is sometimes called an
   "orbital" line."

   Eco-Philosophy & Essays

   [91]My 1-man neighborhood trash crusade--by 8days2amish: "Carrying a
   plastic grocery bag with me on my daily walks is starting to become a
   habit. It's happening frequently enough that my daughters said they're
   thinking about getting me an orange jump suit so it'll at least look
   like I belong to a prison work release program. They think this would
   be better than appearing as I am, just a conscientious father out to
   tidy up the planet they'll one day be inheriting from me. You'd think
   they'd be grateful. If things keep going the way they've always been,
   the planet's the only thing they'll likely be inheriting from me. For
   some reason, even the daughters of two recycle-mad, earth-friendly tree
   huggers like Val and myself sense there is a stigma to a grown man
   wandering around his neighborhood scooping up trash."

   [92]Being green and slow--by cordgrass: "First, I'm taking public
   transportation to work.  Either I take two buses and a train, which
   involves a lot of waiting, or I walk the bus parts of my commute, which
   involves a lot of walking time. A long stroll or waiting for the bus
   are the opposite of the go-go-go 90's. Second, I'm embracing the slow
   food movement. It's cheaper, it's healthier and it's better for the
   environment. Sure, I use a pressure cooker to speed up cooking times,
   and a slow cooker so I don't have to spend hours minding my slow
   cooking, but still there is a lot of time spent chopping vegetables and
   braising."

   in the latest High Country News Jeff Welsch of the Greater Yellowstone
   Coalition thanks James Watt for energizing environmentalists into
   opposition of the destructive pro business plans for the public lands
   of the US begun in the early 80s. I see things differently. I see the
   Watt years as the beginning of the big do nothing period of
   conservation. I'd trade a couple James Watts for one Kyoto Protocol.
   I'd even toss in a Kieran Suckling or two just to sweeten the deal.
   Welsch lists his multi-million annual budget and the large charismatic
   but biologically unendangered carnivores as accomplishments. Dear Jack,
   look out the window of your mansion. See Mt. Moran? The iconic Skillet
   Glacier is shrinking as fast as the polar ice cap dude! Nope. James
   Watt is no hero of mine."

   [95]Bikes and Tisha B'Av, Hope and Climate Change--by swidnikk: "Seeds
   were planted in 2008 when I volunteered for a bicycle advocacy
   non-profit in Tel Aviv. I helped with various technical affairs such as
   publishing a monthly digital newsletter, GoogleApps administration, and
   leadership on a website project. Somehow, I took notice of 350.org,
   probably via Greenprophet, the sustainability news blog of the middle
   east. 350.org's website enabled people to create actions and meetings
   in their own hometowns and this modeled exactly what this non-profit
   needed. With core activities in Tel Aviv, we wanted to enable other
   cities such as Jerusalem, Haifa, and Ra'anana to mature and organize
   further without starting from scratch while keeping in touch and in
   sync with the umbrella organization."

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [112]Civil
   Rights, [113]Community, [114]Congress, [115]Culture, [116]Economy,
   [117]Education, [118]Elections, [119]Energy, [120]Environment,
   [121]Health Care, [122]International, [123]Labor, [124]Law, [125]Media,
   [126]Meta, [127]National Security, [128]Science, [129]Transportation,
   or [130]White House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider
   adding the state ([131]California, [132]Texas, etc). Keep in mind,
   though, that there are many wonderful and important diaries that don't
   fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       about the Obama admin's decision to not finance new power plants
       globally: [253]Global Finance Saying No to New Coal Power Plants.
       In terms of long term climate strategy, this is hugely important.
       As people who are interested in addressing climate change, we
       should keep this on our front burners all of the time. First, to
       make sure it actually happens, and second, to make sure that the
       policy doesn't revert back to financing coal plants when we change
       administrations.
       There is a lot of evidence that suggests that the coal plants that
       will put us into the more catastrophic climate scenarios over the
       next century haven't yet been built. If we can just keep from
       increasing coal infrastructure worldwide, we are way ahead of
       ourselves.
       Anyway, it's an important diary. Check it out.

     [277]Satellite to track climate change

     By Parker Leavitt
     PHOENIX -- The world's first satellite dedicated solely to tracking
     atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide is being developed at a
     Gilbert, Ariz., manufacturing facility, as NASA scientists move to
     make space the next frontier in the study of global climate change.
     The satellite, estimated to cost about $468 million, promises to
     paint a more detailed picture of the environmental impact of global
     warming, including how forests and oceans are reacting to higher
     levels of CO2, scientists say.
     "It's obvious that human emissions, particularly within the
     developing world, have been increasing at a staggering rate," said
     Michael Gunson, project scientist for NASA's Jet Propulsion
     Laboratory in California.
     "It's going to affect all of us, for example, if we find that the
     response of the great rain forests in the Amazon, the Congo and
     Indonesia is very sensitive to climate change," Gunson said.

       enough revenue to run the government on." ~ Will Rogers

   unifying topic here on dKos. Sure, there is some infighting between the
   most rabid coal haters (the ones who see fission as a better choice
   than coal) and the no nukes types, but Kossacks largely agree with
   climate change science and recognize the imperative of getting on with
   addressing it. Most respect the natural environment and wildlife, etc.
   etc.

       There will always be lively discussion here, but I agree that, for
       the most part, there is true unity on the need to attack this
       looming calamity.

       Nuclear power is the only answer to sustain our current way of
       life. It's not just better than coal, it's better than solar -
       because it's actually feasible. From an engineering standpoint, the
       environmentalists are shooting themselves in the foot by being
       rabidly anti-nuclear.

       Many of the reactors in service today are incredibly old and
       inefficient models. Modern reactors are practically the definition
       of safety. They're also cheaper.
       Plus there's room to expand in the nuclear field, technologically
       speaking. Thorium holds great promise as an alternative to uranium.
       Shame we're too busy building solar panels. Maybe one day, solar
       and wind will actually hit 5% of our electrical generation! ... One
       day. If we spend a trillion dollars.
