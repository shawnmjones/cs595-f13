   [29]Michael Bluman Schroeder at The Christian Science Monitor:

     Several Democrats and Republicans in Congress have recently found
     something to agree on: The UN is not worth waiting on in Syria. They
     rightly point out that Russian intransigence makes a Security
     Council resolution impossible. But the UN is more than one
     institution. The Security Council's paralysis implores the US and
     the international community to ask more from other key UN
     institutions, especially the office of UN Secretary General Ban
     Ki-moon.

     President Obama and Congress should wait for the secretary general's
     report on its investigation of chemical weapons use in Damascus
     before using military force in Syria. No nation will be bound by the
     report, but it can confer legitimacy on those calling for a
     concerted response and weaken the legitimacy of those shielding
     perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks.

   [30]Paul Krugman at the The New York Times:

     Before the financial crisis, 63 percent of adult Americans were
     employed; that number quickly plunged to less than 59 percent, and
     there it remains.

     How did that happen? It wasn't a mass outbreak of laziness, and
     right-wing claims that jobless Americans aren't trying hard enough
     to find work because they're living high on food stamps and
     unemployment benefits should be treated with the contempt they
     deserve. A bit of the decline in employment can be attributed to an
     aging population, but the rest reflects, as I said, an immense
     failure of economic policy.

     Set aside the politics for a moment, and ask what the past five
     years would have looked like if the U.S. government had actually
     been able and willing to do what textbook macroeconomics says it
     should have done -- namely, make a big enough push for job creation
     to offset the effects of the financial crunch and the housing bust,
     postponing fiscal austerity and tax increases until the private
     sector was ready to take up the slack. I've done a
     back-of-the-envelope calculation of what such a program would have
     entailed: It would have been about three times as big as the
     stimulus we actually got, and would have been much more focused on
     spending rather than tax cuts. Would such a policy have worked? All
     the evidence of the past five years says yes.

   More on the day's top stories below the fold.

   [31]Rajan Menon at The Los Angeles Times:

     "Credibility" has great power in national security debates. It
     conveys strategic sagacity by using historical analogies. (Neville
     Chamberlain at Munich is a staple.) It warns of consequences that
     transcend specific nations or issues. It points to the "big picture"
     and to complex interconnections. It invokes the United States'
     unique responsibilities for maintaining global order.

     In reality, the credibility gambit often combines sleight of hand
     with lazy thinking (historical parallels tend to be asserted, not
     demonstrated) and is a variation on the discredited domino theory.
     This becomes apparent if one examines how it is being deployed in
     the debate on Syria.

   [32]Ron Waldman, M.D.:

     According to the U.N., one-third of Syrian hospitals have been
     shuttered since the conflict began and a staggering two-thirds of
     medical personnel have either fled or been unable to continue
     working. The repercussions of this breakdown on the health of the
     population are impossible to overestimate, and cannot be dealt with
     effectively until safe access for medical and public health
     personnel can be assured.

     During my recent visit, I observed the the thousands of people with
     chronic conditions stranded in the region's refugee camps. Unlike
     children with acute illnesses that can be treated relatively easily
     and inexpensively in the short term, these patients need on-going
     care with relatively expensive medicines or procedures. Because
     treatment in Syria may have been different from what is customarily
     done in their new host countries and because the cost of that
     treatment may be too much for those countries to absorb, given the
     large number of refugees, those who manage to survive the physical
     violence of the war will find themselves facing the irreversible
     advance of chronic illnesses without adequate medical care.

   [33]Patrick M. Regan, professor of peace studies and political science
   at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, writes at CNN
   about the historical track record of such intervening strikes:

     President Barack Obama faces a terrible choice in the coming days.
     It is whether to kill a number of Syrians who had nothing to do with
     a poison-gas massacre to show President Bashar al-Assad, who
     presumably did have something to do with it, that using chemicals
     weapons violates an international norm.
     Few would doubt the importance of international agreements to
     regulate war, particularly those that safeguard the rights of
     citizens, such as bans on chemical weapons and torture. If al-Assad
     is responsible for the use of chemical weapons, he had full
     knowledge of the norms he was violating. [...]

      A significant amount of research, including my own, demonstrates
     that military interventions from outside states lengthen and make
     bloodier civil wars. Much of this evidence is the result of
     statistical modeling of all civil wars and any associated
     interventions. The data include roughly 1,000 interventions into 100
     civil wars over the last 60 years, with research carried out by
     multiple research teams.
     The results point to patterns in what happens when states intervene
     to try to help their preferred actor, and the results are strong and
     consistent that interventions rarely work to promote peace or reduce
     violence. For example, my own research has shown that the likelihood
     of a civil war lasting for four years without an intervention is
     37%, but if there is an intervention the likelihood that it lasts
     for four years is 60%. The intervention accounts for the 50%
     increase in the length of the war.

   [34]Stephen Stromberg at The Washington Post on lower than expected
   Obamacare premiums:

     We won't have a full picture for a long time. But, as the nation
     prepares for the phase-in of the law's most important elements next
     month, we are starting to get real data back. And at least one major
     criticism -- that the law will require people without
     employer-sponsored insurance to buy very expensive health-care
     coverage -- looks increasingly weak.

   [35]The Detroit Free Press takes on Michigan Senate Republicans for
   their failure to expand Medicaid:

     Self-satisfaction and contempt.

     Those curious emotions beamed from the Michigan Legislature on
     Tuesday, as the Senate refused to give immediate effect to Medicaid
     expansion. [...]

     Michigan's current crop of state lawmakers have indulged a large
     passel of wrongheaded policy-making since 2010. But none could be
     crueler or more foolish than the refusal to expand Medicaid as soon
     as possible.

     This isn't legislative pablum or other triviality. It's about
     people's lives, and significant reform that will help preserve those
     lives.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health

   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Why don't we just replace the name "Syria" with "Texas GOP" and
       "Michigan GOP" in all the targeting and redlines. It would make
       more sense in some ways.

   The Free Press editorial nailed it.  The rightwing nutcases who run
   state government couldn't wait to repeal motorcycle helmet laws, make
   Michigan a Freedom to freeload off unions state (otherwise known as
   "right to work"), tax retiree pensions and give tax cuts to
   corporations.

   Yet, for Medicare recipients, no--you can wait.  I always find it very
   odd that rightwing nutcase conservatives who claim they are "pro-life"
   and "fiscally conservative" do things that harm or kill people and
   actually spend a lot more money than Democrats when in office.

                [173]wintergreen8694, [174]grich01

       "[175]A war the Pentagon doesn't want," by someone I'm probably
       largely in disagreement with on politics in general, but who makes
       some valid points in my experience and opinion:

     None of the White House staff has any experience in war or
     understands it. So far, at least, this path to war violates every
     principle of war, including the element of surprise, achieving mass
     and having a clearly defined and obtainable objective.
       My [176]comment a few days ago seems to apply because a range of
       [177]statements seem to have gotten the administration--and
       us--into a lose-lose situation. I'm afraid it comes from scholarly,
       lawyerly, politician's pontificating that results in confusion and
       later unpleasant consequences.

     Two decades ago, five years ago and today, the source of the problem
     is the same: The president of the United States wishes to represent
     things -- justice, fairness, international norms -- that he cannot,
     or will not, or doesn't know how to defend in practice. In the
     future, it would be far more just, and far less cruel, for the
     president, and the rest of us, simply to say nothing at all.
       "Speak softly and carry a big stick" has much to recommend in these
       cases, but politicians, particularly lawyers and academics gone
       politician, tend to do far too much chattering and then become
       faced with the consequences that come when the stick is forced to
       be brought forth.
       The only foes that threaten America are the enemies at home, and
       those are ignorance, superstition, and incompetence. [Elbert

       United States involved itself in a war with the element of surprise
       or possessing a clearly defined and obtainable objective.  The
       American people have been lied to repeatedly, had its attention

       believing our involvement was on the side of the greater good.  Our
       allies have been betrayed, double-crossed and abandoned by us.  I

       While it is true he could have pushed for more, and likely achieved

       Krugman has acknowledged more than once that it might not have been

       He also acknowledges that the process of legislation is not his

 Do not expect much from U.N. inspectors ([403]0+ / 0-)

   Back on Aug. 26 [404]Mona Mahmood talked to doctor Dr Abu Akram, who
   runs a makeshift hospital at Mua'adamiyat Al-Sham.

   Dr Abu Akram was not impressed with the inspectors.

     They took samples of the soil and some affected animals. They took a
     chicken. They refused to take the chemical rocket. It seems they are
     not allowed to take the rocket with them.

     ...

     The committee did not visit any house in the district. We asked the
     committee to exhume the bodies for checking them. But they refused.
     They say that there was no need to do that.

     We had prepared samples for the committee from some bodies and video
     documentation. There were urine and blood samples as well as
     clothes. But they refused to take them.

     We asked them if they could supply us with medical aid but they said
     that they do not have the authority to do so.

     We are worried that the regime intelligence would play with the
     samples and change them. The hotel is under the control of the
     regime.

     Some of the Arab members of the committee were not in support with
     us. We do not want their support but we want them to be objective.

       That's the real story in that article.
       The doctor's ideas of what the UN team's procedures should be are
       only that -- the doctor's ideas.
       I could certainly defend the UN inspectors' decision to not accept
       urine and blood samples collected by another party. Surely that
       would be prohibited for any inspection team. And since the UN team
       collected tissue and blood samples from victims in hospital, the
       doctor seems unreasonable to request exhumation of bodies for more
       tests.
