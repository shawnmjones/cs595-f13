   Trey Gowdy
   Rep. Trey Gowdy raises the decibels in questioning of witnesses at
   congressional hearing on Benghazi Wednesday.
   In occasionally emotional congressional testimony Wednesday, Gregory
   Hicks, the deputy chief of mission in Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, told
   representatives what unfolded during and after an attack in Benghazi on
   the U.S. consulate and a nearby CIA facility that evening. Hicks, who
   was in the capital of Tripoli at the time, said he was on the phone
   with Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador who was at the consulate.
   "Greg, we're under attack," Hicks quoted Stevens as saying. Then the
   line went dead. It was the last time he talked with Stevens, who was
   killed in the attack, along three other Americans, and at least 10
   Libyan militiamen fighting alongside them.

   Hicks and two other witnesses testified before the House Oversight and
   Reform Committee chaired by Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California.
   The two others were Eric Nordstrom, the State Department's regional
   security officer in Libya at the time, and Mark Thompson, the acting
   deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism at the State
   Department. Their [30]opening statements can be read here.

   Outside some biting opening remarks by the ranking member of the
   committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, and strong support for
   former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from Rep. Carolyn Maloney of
   New York, questions and comments from Democrats on the committee were,
   to be generous, subdued. Cummings said the committee has a
   responsibility to investigate claims [31]before making public
   accusations:

     "In contrast, what we have seen over the past two weeks is a
     full-scale media campaign that is not designed to investigate what
     happened in a responsible and bipartisan manner, but rather to
     launch unfounded accusations and to smear public officials."

   Some of the witnesses' criticisms, especially those of Hicks, have been
   getting a major airing in the traditional media in the past several
   days as right-wing representatives and pundits make extravagant claims
   about the political damage the Benghazi attack--and what they claim is
   a White House coverup of what happened--will do to Obama and to
   Clinton's chances of winning the presidency in 2016.

   Each of the three witnesses criticized aspects of the U.S. response to
   the attack, public statements made afterward regarding who was
   responsible for the attack and what their motive was, the inadequacy of
   security at the unfortified consulate, parts of the [32]independent
   investigation by the State Department Accountability Review Board, the
   failure to interview Thompson as part of that investigation, and the
   two-and-a-half-week delay in the arrival of the FBI team sent to Libya
   to investigate the attack.

   Hicks also said that he was essentially demoted by being assigned to a
   desk job because of his criticism of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's
   public statements that the attack began when protesters motivated by a
   crude video attacking Islam showed up at the consulate gates. Please
   continue reading about the Benghazi hearing below the fold.

   Hicks and the others pointed out that diplomats on the ground in Libya
   knew and told Washington that terrorists were behind the attack.
   Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina [33]put into the record an
   email from Beth Jones, the acting assistant secretary of state for Near
   East Affairs:

     The September 12 email--disclosed for the first time on
     Wednesday--said Jones had spoken to Libya's ambassador to Washington
     who said the attack was the work of former Gadhafi regime loyalists.
     Jones said she told the ambassador: "The group that conducted the
     attacks, Ansar al-Sharia, is affiliated with Islamic terrorists."


   One claim the committee reviewed at some length was Hicks's previous
   assertion in written testimony to the committee that a Special
   Operations team in Tripoli was ordered to stand down rather than fly to
   Benghazi on a C130 and help defend American diplomats and CIA
   operatives under fire in the attack. [34]But:

     Before Hicks appeared before the committee, two senior Pentagon
     spokespeople, George Little and Marine Col. Dave Lapan, worked to
     blunt his testimony. They confirmed that the four-man team was in
     Tripoli before and at the time of the hours-long assault on the U.S.
     diplomatic compound in Libya began. According to them, the four-man
     team was not only not kitted for battle, but their path to Benghazi
     did not reach the city until after the fighting had ended. [...]

     The team, in Tripoli already to train Libyan forces, requested to
     hop on a Libyan C-130 cargo plane to head to Benghazi. But Special
     Operations Command Africa told them not to go, because "there was
     nothing this team could do to assist," Little said, opting to tell
     the team to stay in Tripoli to assist with consular staff's
     evacuation from Benghazi.

   Hicks told the committee that when members of Congress came to Libya to
   investigate, a State Department lawyer sought to keep him from being
   interviewed by them. Hicks did it anyway, with the lawyer trying to
   interject himself in the conversation. Subsequently, Hicks said, he was
   contacted by Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, whose tone, he
   said, was one of reprimand. He has since been assigned a desk job
   stateside, which he views as a demotion.

   One key claim of Clinton's critics is that she personally signed off on
   memos that Nordstrom said ignored his requests for better security in
   Libya, both at the embassy in Tripoli and at the "below-spec"
   consulate. Clinton has testified she did not handle that directly, that
   is was left up to underlings, including the regional security officer,
   which would be Nordstrom himself. He told committee members that he did
   not feel in charge because of being overruled on security matters. He
   said he was told at one point that putting his concerns for added
   security in an official cable would not be helpful.

     Nordstrom, who said he has been given access only to the
     unclassified report released by the accountability board, said he
     found its conclusions and recommendations sensible.

     "It is not what is contained within the report that I take exception
     to but what is left unexamined," he said.

   Whatever round this is in the fight over Benghazi, it's definitely not
   the last. As Issa called the hearing ended, he noted, "But this
   investigation is not over."

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       That's part of the equation.  Another part of this particular

   On August 6, 2001, Bush got a President's Daily Briefing that warned
   that Osama bin Laden was planning to attack. Bush dismissed the report
   cavalierly, and 3000 people died.

   The warning that militants were plotting to hit the consulate in
   Benghazi was not as clear, nor as timely, as the 8/11/01 PDB, and only
   4 people died.

   The fact that the Republicans are flogging this "scandal" shows that
   they believe in an "Equality of Ends," and in all probability, they
   want their ends to be more equal than others'.

   The furor over Friday's [10.5] job report revealed a political movement
   that is rooting for American failure, so obsessed with taking down
   Obama that good news drives its members into a blind rage. -Paul

 The GOP trying to whip Benghazi into a scandal ([367]0+ / 0-)

   reminds me of the meme circulating a week or two ago about how the MSM
   was ignoring/suppressing the Gosnell story.  On fb, a slew of
   righty-beyond-help "friends" posted links to stories about the
   "conspiracy" to ignore the trial.  I took a pass on commenting since it
   would be to no avail.  Then a true friend who is largely center-left,
   but pro-life, posted. I responded:

   "This is the new trendy meme circulating in conservative circles, that
   'the media' is conspiring to suppress the Gosnell story due to liberal
   bias.  The media encompasses thousands of organizations and
   individuals.  Ya really think they all got together and came to a
   consensus to suppress a story? Media is a business that needs to make
   money to stay in business.  Do you think they would conspire to
   suppress a story that the public would eagerly eat up, sending ratings
   (and advertising dollars) into the stratosphere? A more realistic
   scenario is that the stories that were published at the time of
   indictment weren't well read or well commented on, so there was no
   public demand for more coverage.  If the public wanted more coverage of
   Gosnell, and less of, say, Jodi Arias, I have no doubt that HLN and
   Nancy Grace would report live from Philadelphia every night and
   broadcast live coverage.  Does this lack of interest in the Gosnell
   case say something about society as a whole?  Absolutely!  But that is
   for another thread."

   IMO, the citizen masses care more about the Arias case, the Boston
   marathon bombing, and the Cleveland kidnappings, than they do about
   Benghazi.

   Missions under [811]GW Bush, maybe the Democrats should demand that
   these failures to protect diplomats should be revisited and
   investigated--in the interests of national security and how despite all
   the tough talk and wars started by Bush, diplomats were still attacked.

   and...

     ...Moreover, under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
     Relations it is actually the host country that is responsible for
     the security of diplomatic facilities, not the Marines...

   ...maybe the Democrats need to put Issa on the hot seat and ask him if
   he intends to grill the leader of Libya on the failure of security?  Or
   maybe Issa could be called on to explain how he thinks [812]the CIA can
   conduct covert missions--like the one being attempted in Benghazi--
   with a large US military presence--and still keep the mission covert?

   Maybe Issa could explain why he wants to publicly investigate a covert
   CIA mission for the obviously strictly [813]partisan political
   motivation of attacking a strong potential Democratic presidential
   candidate.

   These are the questions that news people would be asking if so many of
   them weren't ignoramuses, and/or over-paid GOP mouthpieces.  These are
   the things Democrats should be saying loudly and clearly if they
   weren't so worried about nicely playing by a totally different set of

       1.  being removed from office
       2.  being barred from further federal office or benefit
       and it is important to know that the founders would have been aware
       of the impeachment of FORMER Governor General of India Warren
       Hastings, which began in 1788 and lasted for years, even though he
       had left India in 1785.  By 1786 the question being raised made it
       clear he was heading for impeachment.
       There is nothing in the Constitution that prevents a former
       government office holder from being impeached for the conduct while
       in office.
       Most impeachments only subject the impeached to being removed from
       office if convicted -  that was true of the charges against Richard
       Nixon and of Alcee Hastings when he was a federal judge.  That is
       why Hastings could be elected to the House.
       It is worth noting that the two charges voted by a Republican House
       against Bill Clinton included both penalties, thereby demonstrating
       the vindictiveness that was involved.
       Given that mindset, do you doubt that the current House, which is
       even more right-wing than that of 1996, would go ahead and impeach
       Hillary if they thought it was a way of either removing her from
       politics or hopefully damaging her enough - especially since right
       now she looks unbeatable/

       State intentionally downplayed that story in favor of the video,
       and even demoted him because he raised concerns.

       The Susan Rice kabuki disgrace at the UN and on the Sunday shows
       caused a lot of problems. Because she called the Libyan president a
       liar on Face the Nation, it kept the FBI out of Benghazi for three
       weeks and botched their investigation. The US lost face in the

       The Benghazi hearings will amount to nothing because everything
       pertaining to the CIA rendition compound in Benghazi hiding behind

       Benghazi -- is highly classified.
       Suffice to say, Petraeous is no longer and Our Chief Torture

   I'm not connected but I can tell you anyone with any political savvy
   knew the White House was not ruling out a terrorist attack from the
   start.

   There were subtle messages sent out from the beginning--sophisticated
   weaponry--taking advantage of an opportunity during general Middle East
   outrage--planned attack--etc.

   The administration never denied these facts.  It just (wisely, I
   believe) said that it couldn't make a final judgment until all the
   facts were in and assessed.

   This is not a cover up.  It's called judicious government. Unlike what

   Dems let a virtually endless parade of right-wing apparatchiks walk
   away unscathed by their tortures, secret prisons, and other war crimes.
    That was (OF COURSE!) justified as "pragmatism".  It was more than
   predictable when anything remotely resembling the shoe being on the
   other foot would never gain similar "kid gloves" treatment.  And here
   we have it, as it always predictably was.  But there's no use trying to
   explain the way of real life and real politics to today's
   "pragmatists", because apparently today "pragmatism" is a concept
   completely unrelated to real life (and totally dedicated to advancing
   the power of the already powerful--power centrism.)  So you can be sure
   this won't be the last time we see this cycle play out.  It's probably
   a fair guess that it will be a defioning characteristic of American
   policy-making and politics for the next half-century.  After all, who
   will change the Dems, or more precisely, who will change the prevailing
   epistemology of the Democratic Party?  So yes, let those Republican
   torturers walk, by all means!

 Some pretty damning testimony - maybe? ([1345]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1346]Sitting Jack Flash

   some things are pretty alarming :

   On 9/12

     "The group that conducted the attacks, Ansar al-Sharia, is
     affiliated with Islamic terrorists."

   Even though Ms. Clinton said two days later:

     We've seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the
     lives of those brave men. We've seen rage and violence directed at
     American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing
     do to with..

   And rice claimed as much for over a week.

   But according to this testimony there was never any mention of a video
   based demonstration. What I STILL can't understand are the reasons
   behind the video story? There is nothing factually that is politically
   damaging in what occurred. Islamists attacked, ambassador killed in the
   line of duty. Rescue mission was too dangerous. Understandable. So who
   had the lame idea blame it on a YouTube video?

   And this:

     a State Department lawyer sought to keep him from being interviewed
     by them. Hicks did it anyway, with the lawyer trying to interject
     himself in the conversation. Subsequently, Hicks said, he was
     contacted by Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, whose tone, he
     said, was one of reprimand. He has since been assigned a desk job
     stateside, which he views as a demotion.

   Sounds kinda' bad. Mills has been a Clinton right hand stalwart and
   confidant since the WJC presidency.

   However, it all needs context. But point humber one has always been
   inexplicable to me.

       The issue of Cheryl Mills' "tone" is pointless.  Unless it was
       taped, that is merely his interpretation, and you know she would
       deny that it was anything like that.
       But as far as the responsible party, I'd be interested in knowing
       how Ms. Mills knew that the next day, particularly since the
       ambassador said it was loyalists to the old regime. The email in
       and of itself is useless. I'm more interested to know how and why
       she came to that conclusion.

       People seem to have forgotten the total context of that horrible
       night.
       There was lots going on in many hotspots across the middle east.
       The embassy in Cairo was being attacked, though no one lost their
       life there.
       The attacks elsewhere did originate as protests over the video and
       things could have blown up at more locations at any time.
       There was a sort of "fog of war" element across the big picture.
       And there was more to the investigation than just hearing from the
       people in Tripoli like Hicks.
       Yes, Hicks knew then and we all know now that there was no video
       protest in Benghazi.  However some Libyan "witnesses" in Benghazi
       did talk about anger over the video and this was among the input
       that intelligence units were sorting out.
       Some people fight fire with fire. Professionals use water.

       This was all known in 24 hours.

     '  However some Libyan "witnesses" in Benghazi did talk about anger

       Huh?
       and that does not comport with the President's "claim"in the debate
       about calling it terrorism (even though he blamed the video for
       days as well) Again, the shifting talking points are way too
       inconsistent.

 but Mr. T ([1367]0+ / 0-)
       If by Sept. 19th the WH was referring to this as a terrorist
       attack, it's hard to see how this was some vast cover-up. If the
       video story was intentionally put out there to somehow help with
       his re-election as some have implied, they didn't get much mileage
       out of it if that angle was over and done with a week later.   And
       there were plenty of concerns raised at WH press conferences prior
       to the election about the Benghazi issue, including why there
       wasn't more adequate security.
       As with all cover-up/conspiracy theories, this one will never die.
        But like it or not, most Americans have moved on. While their main
       focus is jobs, they're probably more concerned about the Boston
       bombing than the attack at Benghazi at this point.

 Actually as I re-read ([1371]0+ / 0-)

   today's transcripts. The Sec of State has a lot to answer for. But I'm
   sure she won't. She was or her direct subordinates were- informed of
   the details within 24 hours and yet she was publicly pushing a false
   narrative afterwards- even to the deceased families. As was Rice and
   the President. Very disturbing.

 I guess what I don't get ([1391]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1392]vcmvo2

   Is how they say the idea that this was a terrorist attack was covered
   up to help with Obama's re-election.  The attack happened September
   11th. There are at least a couple of times in the ensuing days that
   Obama called it "an act of terror" (which I guess is different than a
   terrorist attack).

   But regardless of the semantics, by the time of the election November
   6th, it was acknowledged by the WH and others that this was a terrorist
   attack and that it was distinct from any violence related to that
   video.  We hadn't caught the responsible party (and still haven't), but
   there was no dispute by election night that it was a terrorist attack.

   So what's the issue?

   Unless we are to believe that Hilllary personally supervised all the
   affairs of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near
   Eastern Affairs, the two bureaus at State responsible for security
   lapses,

   what does any of this testimony have to do with impeaching Obama, or
   pre-impeaching Hillary?

   Nordstrom said his pleas for more security were overruled by State.
   The individuals responsible for those decisions have been disciplined
   or fired.

   So we continue to investigate this why?
