   This is a special edition of Wonkbook for the New Year's Eve "fiscal
   cliff" deal.Â

   No Biden, no deal. (ERIC THAYER/REUTERS)

   Suzy Khimm's [349]summary of the fiscal cliff deal:

   â Tax rates will permanently rise to Clinton-era levels for families
   with income above $450,000 and individuals above $400,000. All income
   below the threshold will permanently be taxed at Bush-era rates.

   â The tax onÂ [350]capital gains and dividendsÂ will be permanently set
   at 20 percent for those with income above the $450,000/$400,000
   threshold. It will remain at 15 percent for everyone else. (Clinton-era
   rates were 20 percent for capital gains and taxed dividends as ordinary
   income, with a top rate of 39.6 percent.)

   â The estate tax will be set atÂ [351]40 percentÂ for those at the
   $450,000/$400,000 threshold, with a $5 million exemption. That
   threshold will be indexed to inflation, as a concession to Republicans
   and some Democrats in rural areas likeÂ Sen.Â [352]Max BaucusÂ (D-Mt.).

   â The sequester will be delayed for two months. Half of the delay will
   be offset by discretionary cuts, split between defense and non-defense.
   The other half will be offset by revenue raised by the voluntary
   transfer of traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs,Â which would tax retirement
   savings when theyâre moved over.

   â The pay freezeÂ on members of Congress,Â which Obama
   hadÂ [353]liftedÂ this week, will beÂ [354]re-imposed.

   â The 2009Â [355]expansionÂ of tax breaks for low-income Americans: the
   Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and the American
   Opportunity Tax Credit will be extended for five years.Â

   â The Alternative Minimum Tax will be permanently patched to avoid
   raising taxes on the middle-class.

   â The deal will not address the debt-ceiling, and the payroll tax
   holiday will be allowed toÂ [356]expire.

   â Two limits on tax exemptions and deductions for higher-income
   Americans will beÂ [357]reimposed: Personal Exemption Phaseout (PEP)
   will be set at $250,000 and the itemized deduction limitation (Pease)
   kicks in at $300,000.Â

   âTheÂ [358]full packageÂ of temporary business tax breaks â benefiting
   everything from R&D and wind energy to race-car track owners â will be
   extended for another year.Â

   â ScheduledÂ [359]cuts to doctorsÂ under Medicare would be avoided for
   a year through spending cuts that havenât been specified.

   â Federal unemployment insurance will beÂ [360]extendedÂ for another
   year, benefiting those unemployed for longer than 26 weeks. This $30
   billion provision wonât be offset.Â

   â A nine-month farm bill fix will be attached to the deal, Sen. Debbie
   StabenowÂ [361]toldÂ reporters, averting the newly dubbedÂ [362]milk
   cliff.Â

   Wonkbook's Number of the Day: 89.Â That's the number of senators that
   voted in favor of the fiscal cliff deal. Only 9 voted
   against.Â [363]Opposing the legislation were Democratic Senators Tom
   Carper (D-DE), Tom Harkin (D-IA), and Michael Bennet (D-CO) along with
   Republican Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Richard Shelby (D-AL), Rand Paul
   (R-KY), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Marco Rubio (R-FL). The House is
   expected to vote on the bill in the next few days.

   Top story: Everything you need to know about the fiscal cliff deal

   We have a deal.Â "President Obama and Senate leaders struck a
   bipartisan agreement late Monday to let income taxes rise sharply for
   the first time in two decades, fulfilling Obamaâs promise to raise
   taxes on the rich and avoiding the worst effects of the 'fiscal
   cliff.'â¦As Biden rushed to the Capitol to brief Senate Democrats on
   the deal, Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) laid plans for a vote
   shortly after midnight, when taxes were set to rise for virtually every
   Americanâ¦Upon Senate Âpassage, the measure would go to the House,
   where Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) pledged to bring it to a vote in
   the coming days."Â Lori Montgomery and Paul Kane inÂ [366]The
   Washington Post.

   And it passed. "The Senate approved a bipartisan agreement early
   Tuesday morning to let income taxes rise sharply for the first time in
   two decades, fulfilling President Obamaâs promise to raise taxes on the
   rich and avoiding the worst effects of the âfiscal cliff.â The
   agreement, brokered by Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader
   Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), passed 89 to 8 in a highly unusual New Yearâs
   morning vote. It now heads to the House, where leaders have not
   guaranteed passage but top officials believe it could win passage in
   the next few days." Lori Montgomery and Paul Kane in [367]the
   Washington Post.

   Read:Â [368]The full text of the Senate bill.

   Five facts about the Biden-McConnell deal.Â "The working poor would
   benefit significantly from an extension of tax breaks for low-income
   families: The proposed deal includes a five-year extension of tax
   credits that Obama had expanded in the 2009 stimulus: The Earned Income
   Tax Credit was expanded to help more working poor, particularly those
   with big families; the Child Tax Credit was expanded to help the
   poorest Americans; and a more generous tax credit was given to families
   for college tuition."Â Suzy Khimm inÂ [369]The Washington Post.

   [370]@BobCusack: Conventional wisdom post election of Sen. McConnell
   voting no on deal was dead wrong.

   After a âfiscal cliffâ deal, what next?.Â "Assuming the deal is
   approved, it will nevertheless give way to a nearly continuous series
   of fights that will consume the first part of the year, even as
   President Obama might hope to shift Congressâs attention to immigration
   reform and gun control."Â Rosalind S. Helderman inÂ [371]The Washington
   Post.

   Read:Â [372]President Obamaâs Dec. 31 remarks on âfiscal cliffâ talks
   (Full transcript).

   How much will your taxes change?Â "For millions of wage earners, the
   most immediate effect would be the lapse of a two-percentage-point
   payroll-tax cut that was part of a deal President Barack Obama struck
   with Republicans late in 2010. It lowered to 4.2% from 6.2% the
   employee portion of the Social Security tax, allowing workers to keep
   more take-home pay. For an individual earning the maximum 2013 cap of
   $113,700 or more, the increase would be nearly $200 per month. Overall,
   the expiration of this stimulus would cost working Americans $125
   billion a year."Â Laura Saunders inÂ [373]The Wall Street Journal.

   [374]@Reddy: When the House sees CBO take on what this deal does to the
   deficit, the reaction will be spectacular. Permanent AMT fix/tax cuts =
   trillions

   Winners and losers in the fiscal cliff deal.Â "Bidenâs entrance into
   the cliff negotiations over the weekend -- after a personal plea from
   Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell -- seemed to serve as a sort
   of oiling of locked Congressional gears. The press in the wake of the
   deal (and even in the runup to the final agreement) will focus on the
   idea of Biden as the closer, the guy who got the debt ceiling and
   fiscal cliff deals done for the White House."Â Chris Cillizza
   inÂ [375]The Washington Post.

   [376]@elwasson: Farm bill is in fiscal deal: one year 2008 extension
   without dairy security act

   How Biden rode to the rescue.Â "The late entry of Mr. Biden to the
   tax-and-spending talks that have consumed the capital over the last two
   months recalls his role in the debt crisis of 2011 and once again seems
   to have been critical toward cutting through the deadlockâ¦As soon as
   the talks boiled down to Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell, it became a
   relatively short path to a tentative agreement on taxes. The two talked
   late into the night on Sunday, with their last call coming around 12:45
   a.m. Mr. Biden remained at the White House along with Mr. Obama until 2
   a.m. before returning to the vice presidential residence for a little
   sleep. Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell were back on the phone at 6:30 a.m.
   on Monday, and by the afternoon Mr. Obama and Mr. McConnell were both
   reporting a near-deal."Â Peter Baker inÂ [377]The New York Times.

   [378]@TheStalwart: But seriously, what is the deal with the night-desk
   at the CBO? Are there just always folks there on call?

   The Biden-McConnell relationship, and how it counted in the fiscal
   cliff deal.Â "In the end, it came down to two 70-year-old men, talking
   on the phone. They are not the most powerful men in Washington: Each,
   in his own way, is a second fiddle. Joseph R. Biden Jr. is vice
   president. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is the Senate minority leader, in
   charge only of the senators who are not in charge. But these two men --
   rivals, colleagues and wary friends for almost 28 years -- were the
   ones who finally struck a deal to end the 'fiscal cliff' crisis. The
   New Yearâs Eve agreement between Biden and McConnell provided a glimpse
   at the ways that personality quirks and one-to-one relationships can
   still change the course of Washington politics."Â David A. Fahrenthold
   and Ed OâKeefe inÂ [379]The Washington Post.

   [380]@JohnQuiggin: Unlike everyone else, I see fiscal deal as big win
   for Obama. Predict Repubs will split over this, then cave on debt
   ceiling.

   How the deficit hawks lost on the fiscal cliff.Â "There are two facts
   you should know about the 'fiscal cliff' deal: One, it wonât reduce the
   deficit by much. Two, it wonât avert the fiscal cliff. Whatever deal
   gets worked out this week will be very narrow in scope, simply delaying
   major parts of the fiscal cliff and doing little to reduce the
   deficit."Â Suzy Khimm inÂ [381]The Washington Post.

   Explainer:Â [382]The âfiscal cliffâsâ Most Valuable Republicans.

   No grand deal. A legislative quick-fix.Â "The confusing struggle to
   head off a national fiscal crisis has made one thing crystal clear: The
   era of the Big Deal is overâ¦The list of unrealized goals from Mr.
   Obama and Mr. Boehnerâs last attempt at a grand bargain two weeks ago
   are breathtaking in their number, particularly when compared with the
   probable outcome of these final Congressional negotiations. Ambitious
   plans to overhaul the individual tax code, tackle corporate rates,
   revamp the Medicare program and possibly consider changes in Social
   Security appear to have given way mainly to a tax increase for big
   earners."Â Jennifer Steinhauer inÂ [383]The New York Times.

   [384]@robertcostaNRO: Lots of pressure on Senate to come through w/
   70ish, not 60ish votes on deal, per top Repub senators. 70ish gives
   Boehner lift in final push

   Obamaâs wrong: This âcliffâ deal still raises taxes on the middle
   class.Â "Taxes will rise on the middle class even if this deal passes,
   because it doesnât include an extension of the payroll tax holiday.
   That means that the paychecks for more than 160 million Americans will
   be 2 percent smaller starting in January, as the payroll tax will jump
   from 4.2 percent to 6.2 percent. And a huge number of those hit will be
   middle class or working poor."Â Suzy Khimm inÂ [385]The Washington
   Post.

   [386]@robertcostaNRO: I hear Boehner is unhappy with the deal. Not sure
   he can sell. Not sure how conf. will respond, per Senate sources
   familiar w/ the talks.

   We just hit the debt ceiling.Â "On top of everything else, the United
   States officially hits its debt ceiling today, starting a countdown
   clock that ends in a cash management crisis in a matter of weeksâ¦Right
   now, the Treasury is undertaking 'extraordinary measures' to give the
   government enough breathing room to pay all of its bills. But such
   measures buy Washington only so much time. In February or March, the
   Treasury secretary would need to decide which payments to delay or
   default on."Â Annie Lowrey inÂ [387]The New York Times.

   [388]@TPCarney: I'm looking for a decent conservative case to vote
   against this deal. Haven't found it.

   Why the White House thinks it's winning.Â "Consider the ongoing fiscal
   cliff negotiations from the White Houseâs perspectiveâ¦It raises taxes
   by $600 billion over 10 years, secures important Democratic priorities
   like unemployment insurance and the stimulus tax credits, and doesnât
   include any spending cuts of noteâ¦It would be going too far to say
   White House officials are thrilled with this package. But it looks
   pretty good to them. As they see it, it sets up a three-part deficit
   reduction process."Â Ezra Klein inÂ [389]The Washington Post.

   [390]@amacker: The muni bond tax exemption, eyed by Obama and House Rs,
   isn't changed by Biden-McConnell plan, a victory for states and
   localities.

   Why Republicans think theyâre winning.Â "Consider the ongoing 'fiscal
   cliff' negotiations from the Republican Partyâs perspective. Not the
   revanchist conservatives who never believed theyâd need to compromise,
   but the realists who knew, when they lost the election, that compromise
   was inevitableâ¦The question for Republicans has always been how to get
   to the debt ceiling while giving up the minimum in tax increases. Many
   of them figured that theyâd at least have to give on the Bush tax cuts
   for income over $250,000â¦All this raises the tantalizing prospect for
   Republicans that they could end these negotiations having given up less
   tax revenue than they ever thought possible -- less tax revenue than
   Boehner offered Obama, even -- but still getting their entitlement
   cuts."Â Ezra Klein inÂ [391]The Washington Post.

   [392]@mattyglesias: Has the fiscal cliff recession started yet? I feel
   like GDPâs been super-low for the past six minutes.

   Hereâs what Republicans really hated about Obamaâs news
   conference.Â "President Obamaâs cheerful, mocking statement enraged
   Republicans. But the bigger problem is he said something Republican
   leaders have been trying to hide from their members. Obama said,
   clearly, that if the GOP wants more spending cuts later, theyâre going
   to need to hand over more taxes, too. In fact, he said it
   repeatedly."Â Ezra Klein inÂ [393]The Washington Post.

   SEIB: Why reaching deals is hard.Â "There are multiple reasons that
   even the seemingly easy still is hard in Washington right now. The
   problems start, of course, with the basic polarization of not just
   Congress but the country. America is right now in an unusual political
   state, in which the two parties are very evenly divided in power, but
   far apart ideologically."Â Gerald F. Seib inÂ [394]The Wall Street
   Journal.

   COHN: The fiscal cliff's biggest winner? George W. Bush.Â "Itâs as if
   President George W. Bush finally wonâthe tax cuts heâd always wanted
   would be staying on the books indefinitely, 'starving the [government]
   beast' of the resources it needs to survive. But that analysis is also
   too simplistic. For one thing, not all of the Bush tax cuts would be
   staying on the books under this deal. Taxes on higher incomes would
   return to their Clinton-era levelsâ¦This deal gives Bush a victory,
   yes. But it's far from a total one."Â Jonathan Cohn inÂ [395]The New
   Republic.

   BROOKS: Fiscal flop.Â "Obviously, the fiscal cliff negotiations were
   not going to lead toward the deep structural reforms that will
   eventually be needed. But they could have begun the reform processâ¦But
   the proposal is not a balance of taxes and spending cuts. It doesnât
   involve a single hard decision. It does little to control spending. It
   abandons all of the entitlement reform ideas that have been thrown
   around. It locks in low tax rates on families making less than around
   $450,000; it is simply impossible to avert catastrophe unless tax
   increases go below that line. Far from laying the groundwork for future
   cooperation, it sentences the country to another few years of budget
   trench warfare."Â David Brooks inÂ [396]The New York Times.

   BERNSTEIN: A deal liberals can live with, probably.Â "It looks as if
   weâre going to get a two-part fiscal cliff deal: Congress will finish
   voting on part one tomorrow or Wednesday, and part two at some point in
   the near future, although itâs possible theyâll wind up getting merged.
   Itâs important to get all the details on these things, but based on
   what is being reported so far, it appears to be a deal that liberals
   should be able to live with -- pending part twoâ¦"Â Jonathan Bernstein
   inÂ [397]The Washington Post.

   SAMUELSON: The fiscal cliff and leadership failure.Â "Only the
   president can pose these questions in a way that starts a national
   conversation over the choices to be made, but doing so requires the
   president to tell people things they donât want to hear. Thatâs his
   job: to help Americans face unavoidable, if unpleasant, realities.
   Barack Obama has refused to play this role. Instead, he has cast the
   long-term budget problem as a question of whether the richest 1 percent
   or 2 percent of the population should pay more in taxes."Â Robert J.
   Samuelson inÂ [398]The Washington Post.

   Top op-eds

   PONNURU: My predictions for 2013.Â "It will also be a year of
   unexpected setbacks for President Barack Obamaâs health-care
   lawâ¦Predictions: Premiums will go up, especially for young people. The
   Washington Postâs recent report that 'Obamacare exchanges will open for
   business' on Oct. 1 will be proved false when Health and Human Services
   Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admits the federal government wonât be
   ready by then. The Obama administration will propose further delaying
   the law."Â Ramesh Ponnuru inÂ [400]Bloomberg.

   SUNSTEIN: End of the world, and I feel fine.Â "Most of us acknowledge
   that some of our most cherished beliefs are based on faith, not facts.
   Even so, it takes a lot to dislodge those beliefs. When we are
   confronted by contrary evidence, we may dig in even more deeply.
   Consider a cautionary tale, exotic to be sure, but helping to explain
   why evidence-challenged thinking persists in a lot of areas, including
   politics and business."Cass R. Sunstein inÂ [401]Bloomberg.

   The fiscal cliff and the economy

   The deal may mean slower growth.Â "The biggest hit to 2013 growth
   appears likely to come from the payroll-tax holiday's expiration on
   Monday. The deal reached by the White House and Senate Republicans
   wouldn't extend this tax break."Â Sudeep Reddy inÂ [403]The Wall Street
   Journal.

   Markets didn't sweat the cliff. They were basically right, it
   seems.Â "The financial markets are proving to be surprisingly
   indifferent to the last-ditch negotiations underway Monday to avert an
   austerity crisis. The stock market was up 0.2 percent at 11:00 a.m. as
   measured by the Standard & Poorâs 500 index. A key measure of expected
   market volatility known as the Vix index was actually down slightly
   Monday morning, falling 2.4 percent after a steep rise on
   Friday."Â Neil Irwin inÂ [404]The Washington Post.

   Despite turmoil, markets did well in 2012.Â "What stands out is how
   well financial stocks and consumer discretionary stocks did during
   2012. The latter stocks are things purchased by consumers that are
   likely to do better when the economy is improving. In the United
   States, the two best such stocks in the S.& P. 500 were PulteGroup, a
   homebuilder, and Whirlpool, an appliance maker."Â Floyd Norris
