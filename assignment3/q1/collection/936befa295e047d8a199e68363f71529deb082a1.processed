In his second term, Obama becomes bolder on the environment

By [292]Juliet Eilperin, E-mail the writer

   President Obama's environmental policies are likely to play a prominent
   role in defining his second term, even as the budget, immigration and
   health care still dominate the current political debate.

   When [293]Gina McCarthy first met with Obama in the Oval Office on Jan.
   10 to discuss the prospect of heading the [294]Environmental Protection
   Agency, she recalled, "the first words out of his mouth was the need
   for EPA to focus on climate."

   "He sees this as a necessary part of his legacy," she said in a recent
   interview.

   Cutting carbon emissions and preparing for the impacts of climate
   change are the biggest environmental policies the president is
   pursuing, but they are not the only ones. His deputies are laying the
   groundwork to manage public lands across broad regions, drawing on
   high-tech mapping to balance energy interests against conservation
   needs. They also are preparing to weigh in on a controversial mining
   proposal in Alaska.

   In the administration's first term, it framed climate initiatives
   [305]as ways to promote energy independence or cut consumer costs. It
   also made modest concessions to business interests -- such as rejecting
   a controversial smog rule, which would have affected a broad swath of
   industries, and delaying other regulations.

   Agency heads were given very different guideposts for the second term
   as Obama deputized a new team of Cabinet members to enact a series of
   rules and policies aimed at tackling global warming.

   In his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, Obama has a policy manager who
   has written and contributed to several pieces on climate change as a
   senior fellow at the liberal [306]Center for American Progress think
   tank in 2006 and 2007. He is a sharp contrast to former Obama chiefs of
   staff William Daley and Rahm Emanuel, who both privately saw global
   warming as a political liability for the president.

   The shift has alarmed some industry officials, as well as coal allies.
   Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) described the administration as coal's
   "[307]adversary" and [308]brought a state delegation headed by West
   Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin (D) into the White House on Aug. 1 to
   meet with McCarthy and Michael Rodriguez, the White House legislative
   affairs director.

   While Manchin called the nearly hour-long session "very respectful and
   productive," he also said it exposed the "deep differences" between
   politicians like himself and Obama.

   "You cannot describe this any differently than as a war on coal, and
   not just in West Virginia or the U.S. but on a global scale," he said.
   "They're using every tool they have to destroy the most abundant,
   reliable and affordable resource that we have."

   Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who co-founded the [309]"Safe Climate
   Caucus" with Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) and [310]has pressed the
   White House for years to address the issue more aggressively, said he
   has sensed "a sea change" since Obama [311]unveiled his climate plan in
   June.

   "It does not appear to be `just make a speech and walk away,' " he said
   in an interview. "It appears to be a lasting and real policy shift."
