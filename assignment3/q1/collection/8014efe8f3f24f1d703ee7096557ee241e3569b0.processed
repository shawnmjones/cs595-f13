We Cannot Sit Out the Race for Global Talent

   New York City would not have become a global economic capital if we had
   not also been a global immigration capital.

   Ellis Island was historically the gateway for many of our nation's
   newest arrivals who came here to find opportunity -- and then worked
   hard, started businesses, and saved enough money to give their children
   a better life.

   Today, that story continues. Nearly 40 percent of New Yorkers are
   immigrants, and they play a vital role in driving our economy and
   creating jobs. In fact, 48 percent of all businesses in New York City
   are owned by immigrants. But our companies -- like companies around the
   country -- are having trouble hiring the workforce they need to compete
   in the global marketplace.

   Our federal immigration system is broken, and until we fix it, our
   economy will continue to suffer and other countries will continue to
   gain jobs at our expense. For instance, right now we welcome the best
   and brightest students to study at our universities -- where we often
   subsidize and support them -- and then, after they have earned their
   degrees, we send them packing. Meanwhile, our competitors around the
   world line up to offer them jobs. These students are the innovators of
   tomorrow -- and we are losing them to our competitors.

   Likewise, we want entrepreneurs with innovative ideas to start their
   companies here in America, creating jobs for American workers. More
   than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or
   the children of immigrants, and immigrant-owned businesses generate
   more than $775 billion in annual revenue. But there is no visa for
   immigrant entrepreneurs to come here and launch their companies.

   If America is going to lead the global economy, we cannot sit out the
   race for global talent. Companies in sectors from agriculture to
   aerospace, hospitality to high tech, and media to manufacturing all
   require an immigration system based on today's modern economy. But our
   immigration laws haven't been significantly updated since the 1960s.

   Business leaders, mayors, and Americans across the country understand
   how important this issue is to our future -- and finally Washington is
   getting the message. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been
   working together on a reform plan, but it won't pass unless all of us
   make our voices heard.

   Today, the bipartisan group of more than 500 mayors and CEOs who make
   up the Partnership for a New American Economy are teaming up with
   Organizing for Action and Republicans for Immigration Reform to kick
   off the largest-ever virtual march on Washington to support bipartisan
   reform. Along with our supporters at Huffington Post and leaders from
   politics, business, tech, media, sports, and entertainment, we are
   going to harness the power of modern-day technology to urge our elected
   officials to back smart immigration legislation -- and, in turn, keep
   America's economy strong.

   I invite you to join us at [267]www.MarchForInnovation.com. We're
   closer than ever before to achieving meaningful reform.

   Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent, is the mayor of New York City.

   This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and The
   Partnership for a New American Economy, in conjunction with the March
   for Innovation, a virtual march taking place May 22-23 across a number
   of social-media platforms designed to call attention to the
   immigration-reform bill now before Congress. One of those platforms
   will be HuffPost Live. For more information on the march, click
   [268]here.
