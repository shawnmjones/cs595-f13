[24]Database-hating National Rifle Association may very well have you in its
database if you own a gun

   Multiple Guns
   One of the mainstays of the argument the National Rifle Association and
   other gun lobby groups have made against universal background checks
   for gun sales is that this would create a database that would amount to
   a backdoor registration system which would eventually be used to
   confiscate some or all firearms. That was one of the key arguments that
   stopped the watered-down Manchin-Toomey gun safety legislation in
   April.

   Universal background checks don't require a registry. Background checks
   mandated for commercial sales don't produce such a registry. Which is
   not to say that a registry is a bad idea.

   Indeed, for the past 79 years, there has been a registry that was
   initiated under the National Firearms Act of 1934. It requires anyone
   who wants to buy a machine-gun or other fully automatic firearm,
   silencer or gadget-gun (like a cane gun) undergo a thorough FBI
   background check, pay a tax and have their name and the weapon they
   have purchased added to a registry, which was long ago turned into a
   computer database. In all those years, there has been no confiscation
   of the hundreds of thousands of weapons registered on that database, no
   harassment of their owners, no midnight knocks at the door.

   But, as [30]pointed out by TriSec, the NRA is not so skittish when it
   comes to the database the organization itself maintains:

     But in fact, the sort of vast, secret database the NRA often warns
     of already exists, despite having been assembled largely without the
     knowledge or consent of gun owners. It is housed in the Virginia
     offices of the NRA itself. The country's largest privately held
     database of current, former, and prospective gun owners is one of
     the powerful lobby's secret weapons, expanding its influence well
     beyond its estimated 3 million members and bolstering its political
     supremacy.

     That database has been built through years of acquiring gun permit
     registration lists from state and county offices, gathering names of
     new owners from the thousands of gun-safety classes taught by
     NRA-certified instructors and by buying lists of attendees of gun
     shows, subscribers to gun magazines, and more, BuzzFeed has learned.
     [...]

     The NRA won't say how many names and what other personal information
     is in its database, but former NRA lobbyist Richard Feldman
     estimates they keep tabs on "tens of millions of people."

   In other words, this ain't no membership list. These are not people
   voluntarily providing their information to the NRA. These aren't people
   checking a "terms of service" box. This is the association Hoovering up
   all these data without any of the targets on those lists having a clue
   it's happening. Please read more below the fold on the NRA's game.

   The NRA hypocrisy runs deep. Last year, the Westchester Journal News
   [31]published an online map of gun permit owners in two New York
   counties, many people criticized the move as an invasion of privacy,
   and an invitation to burglaries or worse. The paper soon took the map
   down. Nobody was more critical than the NRA. Likewise when the editor
   of the North Carolina Cherokee Scout dared to request--not publish, but
   merely request--similar data from his local sheriff, he was forced to
   apologize and resign after receiving [32]death threats from gun owners.
   The NRA excoriated him, too, and sought legislation barring the release
   of such information by local authorities.

   But as Sergio Hernandez at Gawker [33]pointed out in February, the NRA
   has been collecting such data from authorities for a long time. Steve
   Friess [34]quotes former NRA lobbyist Richard Feldman:

     "We've been doing this since the old days," Feldman said. "You could
     obtain from most states the listings of hunter licenses from the
     Department of Wildlife and Conservations. It was sort of amazing
     what we knew about people from that. There were early
     [concealed-carry] permit holders, black powder holders, so many
     different seasons. It was a lot of data."

     Complementing this practice is the mining of data on the thousands
     who take gun safety classes from NRA-certified instructors.
     Arulanandam said there are 97,000 of them, a figure that impressed
     [Laura Quinn, CEO of Catalist, a data analysis firm used by Obama
     for America] as a larger "army of organizers" than Obama had.

   The NRA hasn't stopped doing this. As Friess reports, NRA lobbyist
   Christopher Rager wrote to Iowa Department of Public Safety legislative
   in 2011 inquiring how to go about obtaining data from the state's
   concealed-permit files and how much it might cost to have the files
   copied and mailed to the association's headquarters.

   Imagine if the Obama campaign or former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords'
   gun-safety lobbying group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, were
   found to be fishing for such data from state agencies. The NRA's
   shrieks would be heard all the way to Tierra del Fuego.

   What does the NRA use its list for? Politics, of course. Like campaigns
   to bellyache about databases of gun owners. Campaigns seeking to smear
   and defeat elected officials who don't follow the association's
   prescriptions for loosening already loose gun laws. And, you can be
   sure, helping manufacturers sell more guns, which has for a long time
   been the NRA's primary mission.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health

   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       early 70's. They helped train in gun safety at gun clubs. Dad was
       also an enthusiast of Civil War era guns and owns a particularly
       beautiful Norfolk muzzle-loader which was the first gun I ever shot
       after having made the minie balls with him in the cellar and packed
       them with bee's wax and the cartridges with black powder. It
       knocked me on my butt, but I was also about 12. Maybe 11.
       I grew up on a farm. I was exposed to guns, and it was important
       that we learned early how to respect them.
       My dad abandoned the NRA in the early 80's when they started to get
       "political". He is an advocate for gun control, and his guns? All
       in safes with trigger locks on top of that.
       It's interesting to see just who the real responsible gun owners
       are.
       I resent that. I demand snark, and overly so -- Markos Moulitsas.

   that I commented on already, but I'll say it here again.  I don't have
   a gun, never owned a gun, don't want to own a gun.  But I did take a
   class in gun safety that apparently got me on the NRA list and now I
   can't get rid of their phone calls and mailings.  If they only knew who
   they were trying to recruit!

   Point being, the database is their marketing database and it includes
   more than gun owners.  The question is whether it distinguishes between
   the two.  I'm sure they try to mark those who have permits (public
   information) or purchased guns from dealers (private information sold
   to them).

   We are all in this together.

   This great nation of ours has more guns per capita than any other

 I think that the folks with ANONYMOUS ([616]0+ / 0-)

   should hack the NRA and steal this database and publish it.

   I never know quite how to feel about Anonymous, but this would make me
   very happy

   That passed by; this can, too. - Deor

 Their database is inaccurate as well... ([619]1+ / 0-)

   Seven years ago, my son had to take an NRA shooting sports instructor
   training for his job with the Boy Scouts.  At that time, he still used
   my e-mail address.  I;m still getting NRA e-mails, but neither my son
   or I own guns.  We both believe in responsible gun use, and responsible
   regulation.  But somewhere, somehow, Wayne LaPierre believes I'm on his
   side, because he has my e-mail address in his database.

   The Scout Law (trustworthy, loyal, helpful...) is a GREAT liberal
   manifesto.

 If the NRA's membership is ever hacked... ([623]0+ / 0-)

   and the names are made public, buy stock in brown pants manufacturers.

   There will be a shit storm.

   Sarcasm on...It is so nice I live in a post racial America...Sarcasm

 NSA has NRA Gun database looking for Terrorists? ([626]0+ / 0-)

 Dear Outraged Kossacks...... ([629]0+ / 0-)

   ......who can't tell the difference between a civil rights organization
   using publicly available governmental data in addition to
   self-generated information to create a database and the federal
   government mandating a central database: congratulations!  You have
   gone full TeaParty.

   I half expect that you shall next conflate my accidental overhearing
   1/2 of a conversation between an oblivious and non-conscientious
   cellphone user and rampant illegal NSA eavesdropping.

 The first headline about this I saw, I misread ([632]0+ / 0-)

   NRA as NSA (incipient dyslexia) and thought 'oh my, they're actually
   doing something useful'

   They that have power to hurt, and will do none
