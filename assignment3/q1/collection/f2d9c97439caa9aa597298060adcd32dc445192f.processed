Reject Hate.
The crime on Sunday that left a community devastated and a nation wondering
how such evil still happens today

   [12]Image of Reject Hate.
   August 7, 2012 [13]Allegiance World Premiere at the Old Globe
   [14]Exclusive Pre-sale by George Takei

   Terror and tragedy struck a Milwaukee suburb on Sunday as a white
   supremacist opened fired in a Sikh temple, killing six and critically
   injuring three.  Worshippers reportedly hid inside closets while the
   killer walked through the temple, firing coldly and repeatedly.  After
   responding to multiple 911 calls, Oak Creek police shot and killed the
   gunman. Thousands of Sikh temples across the world are holding vigils
   this week for the deceased and injured, who range in age from 39 to 84.

   Since the events of 9/11, the targeting of Sikhs has been a horrific
   by-product of hate crimes intended for Muslim Americans. That
   perpetrators of such crimes mistakenly believe Sikhs to be Muslim
   reinforces the fact that ignorance lies at the root of racial and
   ethnic hate. That such acts against any group still occur in America
   today saddens me beyond words.

   Seventy years ago, over 120,000 Japanese Americans, including my
   family, were rousted from our homes and sent to internment camps
   because we happen to "look" like the people who bombed Pearl Harbor.
   Today, Sikhs are targeted because their headdress happens to resemble
   turbans commonly associated with Arabs. These impulses are not
   disconnected; they are part of a tragic continuum in which whole groups
   people are viewed as the "enemy" because of how they look or act.

   There are no easy answers here, and my heart aches for the families and
   victims and the senselessness of the killings. What I do know is this:
   Each of us bears a responsibility to reject hate, whatever its form,
   whatever its justification. A soul filled with hate can devastate a
   community. A nation filled with hate can devastate a people. It must
   start and end with each of us.

   - George Takei
