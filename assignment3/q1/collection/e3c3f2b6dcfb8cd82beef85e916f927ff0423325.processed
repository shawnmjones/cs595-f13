[24]Happy 40th Obamacare care repeal vote day!

   Silhouette of man pushing big number 40.
   Apparently wanting to leave for their five-week break on a high (?)
   note, or at least with a vote they can "win," Republican House
   leadership went back to the Obamacare repeal well. For the 40th time.
   Today's vote was the "Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act," H.R.
   2009, [30]combining Republican hatred of Obamacare with their paranoid
   fantasies about the IRS. It passed 232-185, and  would prevent the IRS
   from enforcing any part of Obamacare. Or at least it would in an
   alternative universe, one with a Republican Senate and a president who
   would sign it.

   It's as baldly a base-frothing-up vote as any Republicans have taken on
   repeal, the last vote taken before an August that is going to be, once
   again, focused on feeding the base what it wants. They have to keep the
   base at as high a level of fear and paranoia and frenzied furor as
   possible to justify more Obamacare votes, to justify the extreme
   measure they're toying with: shutting down the government over
   Obamacare. This is the [31]debacle John Boehner has wrought.

     Boehner and his allies want to head off an effort by conservatives
     to demand that the healthcare law be defunded in a stopgap spending
     measure that Congress must pass to avert a government shutdown at
     the end of September. [...]

     The Speaker privately opposes the strategy, but he has yet to rule
     it out and wants to let his conference determine the way forward
     over the August recess. He said on Thursday that no decisions had
     been made on how to construct the stopgap bill, known as a
     continuing resolution (CR).

   Does this smell like a set-up to anyone else? The House goes on recess
   immediately after its 40th vote on Obamacare repeal, taking that vote
   to their rabid constituents to whip up them up in town meetings they
   have already planned to be a [32]hate-fest against "Washington," i.e.,
   the IRS, President Obama, Harry Reid, and Obamacare. Then they return
   to Washington, where Boehner is going to let them decide how to proceed
   on shutting down the government. Which Boehner "privately" opposes.

   And the insanity goes on.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [50]Tagging tips - [51]Search For Tags - [52]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   to ensure high turnout in 2014.

   But the GOP won't actually need to do that much to repeal the ACA. I'm
   sure that once the exchanges go online, many of the consumer protection
   provisions will be challenged in court. The administration won't bother
   to defend them. Since so much of it is left to the states, the
   insurance companies can go shopping for judges and jurisdictions which
   will give a favorable verdict.

   And then, many things like Bernie Sanders' community health care
   centers have already been defunded as part of the deals between the WH
   and the GOP on the "fiscal cliff" bullshit. Every time we go through
   this budget crisis nonsense, it chips away at the good parts of the
   ACA. The administration has shown little interest in fighting for these
   parts of the law; indeed, their prime concern seems to be getting a
   deal with the lunatics in charge of the Republican party.

   As for what remains, once the GOP regains control of both houses of
   Congress in 2014, they'll be able to muck up quite a bit of it if they
   choose. I just don't think there will be that much left of it by then.

       but by disenfranchising the voter base of the opposition. Also by
       dividing the opposition.
       And the oh-so-clever Dem leadership is just bright enough to give
       the Republicans plenty of ammunition. Obama put Social Security
       cuts in his budget request and you can be sure that the GOP will
       try to hang that albatross around every single Democratic
       candidate's neck in 2014.
       You see, in a democracy, no matter how stupid you may be, you get
       to vote. At least if you're white and male. Otherwise, you are
       liable to be purged from the rolls by any one of a dozen legal,
       quasi-legal, and illegal means that the Republicans, in their
       endless ingenuity, have devised to swing things their way.
       You don't have to persuade a majority of the country to win an
       election, just a majority of those allowed to vote. And as we saw
       in 2000, sometimes you don't even have to do that much.
       So yes, despite being totally out of touch and unrepresentative of
       the country, the GOP can still regain power in this country.
       I think it is a grave mistake to think the GOP is stupid. They are
       antediluvian in their views, yes--some of them object to the use of
       fire and the wheel. But don't ever think that means they're not
       politically savvy.
       Even when they're forced into a defensive position, they know what
       to do to gain small footholds that will serve them well five or ten
       years down the road. And the Dems are just feckless enough to let
       them off the hook.

   Back in early July 2013 when the GOP had only held 33 pointless votes
   on killing Obamacare, the estimated cost to taxpayers for this absurd
   waste of time was [536]$48 million..

   Now that the GOP morons are up to 40 votes, the cost to us taxpayers
   must be north of $50 million.

   At the same time that this is going down, GOP hack Senators like
   Sessions and Hatch are advancing a line of pure bull shit by asserting
   that the country cannot afford $3 million to hire 3 judges for vacant
   seats in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.

   It's looking to me like the GOP is nothing more than a continuing
