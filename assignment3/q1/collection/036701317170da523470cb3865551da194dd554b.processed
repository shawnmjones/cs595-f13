How To Apologize After You Call A 9-Year-Old Girl A Horrible Name In Front Of
Everyone

   The Onion, America's Finest News Source (satirical), tweeted something
   truly awful. [6]It's so awful, I'm linking to it rather than saying it.
   Thankfully, after an outcry, their CEO also decided to hold them
   accountable. While it's not comprehensive, it's a start. Take note,
   politicians: you could learn something from this.

   this horrible episode, you might help encourage a more positive
   representation of girls and women in the media. The best way I know how
   to do that is to [12]like Miss Representation on Facebook, and [13]take
   their pledge.Â
