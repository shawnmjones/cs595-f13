The triumph of style over substance

   One of the main drawbacks to televised political theatrics is that we
   tend to evaluate the events in an unconstructive way. We see players on
   a stage, after extensive rehearsals, playing to a packed house, and we
   judge them as if they are actors -- who seemed "crisp" and looked
   "confident."

   In other words, we invariably value political theater on its theatrical
   qualities, watching to see who knew their lines and delivered them more
   effectively.

   By this measure, when it comes to determining who "won" last night's
   debate in Denver, I'd argue the conventional wisdom is right: it wasn't
   close. Based on style and performance, Mitt Romney did all of the
   things a "winning" debater is supposed to do.

   Did he know his lines? Obviously, yes. Did he deliver them well?
   Flawlessly. I [3]argued last week that Romney's "strength as a debater
   is wildly underappreciated" and "if Democrats expect Romney to falter
   in the debates, they're making a big mistake." Last night illustrated
   what I was talking about.

   President Obama, meanwhile, was listless and timid. He stumbled on his
   words. At times he seemed distracted and unfocused. There were key
   opportunities for the president to go on the offensive, but for
   whatever reason, he chose not to engage. For pundits checking boxes --
   who gave the appearance of being "in control"? -- Romney excelled.

   But all of this overlooks an element I like to think is sometimes
   important: substance. The men on the stage last night aren't actors;
   they're candidates for the nation's highest office. Delivering lines
   well is a nice quality, but as the dust settles, it's worth pausing to
   reflect on whether those lines were true and reflect reality in any
   meaningful way.

   Indeed, it seems to me Romney thrived in large part because he
   abandoned the pretense of honesty. And as it turns out, winning a
   debate is surprisingly easy when a candidate decides he can say
   anything and expect to get away with it.

   Romney told viewers his proposed $5 trillion tax cut isn't really his
   proposed $5 trillion tax cut. He suggested he could eliminate a $1
   trillion deficit by going after Big Bird. He said his non-existent
   health care plan protects those with pre-existing conditions when in
   reality the exact opposite is true. He cited trumped up "studies" from
   far-right ideologues as if they're legitimate, assuming the public
   won't know the difference. He said a deficit that's shrunk has actually
   "doubled."

   And when Romney wasn't repeating falsehoods, he was furiously shaking
   an Etch A Sketch, rolling out yet another version of himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This new model -- version 8.0? 9.0? -- likes regulations of the
   financial industry, wants to work with Democrats, thinks his
   Massachusetts health care law was a great idea, and has no use for the
   goals of his running mate's budget plan that Romney enthusiastically
   endorsed. Does this in any way reflect the candidate who's been running
   for president the last year and a half? No, but the Republican assumes
   most voters won't realize and most news organizations covering the
   campaign won't tell them.

   He might very well be right.

   But as Romney and his supporters take a victory lap this morning, it's
   fair to note their success was a triumph for style over substance.

   The reason everyone is surprised at how well Romney did in the debates
   is because they have been listening to MSM's interpretation of who he
   is and what he believes. Last night Romney had his first opportunity to
   talk directly to the American people so people could see for themselves
   and make their own judgement. I have to say the same for Obama - he
   opted not to show up and instead sent in the empty chair.....

   Really? This was the FIRST time Romney had the opportunity to speak
   directly to the American people?? Not the two years on the campaign
   trail for GOP nomination, not 2008 when he ran for president then and
   lost to John McCain in the GOP primaries?? Not the RNC which was dubbed
   the first night Romney could present himself to the nation?? Not the
   tens of dozens of political Op Ed pieces he's written over the past six
   years in public forum? This man has had ample opportunity to talk
   'directly to the American people'. To say to the contrary is
   ridiculous. Maybe it was the first opportunity for Romney version 143.2
   to unveil himself to the American people, but not Romney the actual
   candidate. This man wants to be president so bad he can taste it. He
   cares little for the middle class, if you've actually followed his
   campaign over the past two years. This version of Romney last night
   almost seemed to care. He must have practiced really really hard to
   "nail it".

   Do you not consider any of his prior public statements to be "talking
   directly to the American people"? The debates leading to the
   nomination, for example? The candid Boca Raton dinner party?

   I think that's the point here ... what we saw last night was very nice,
   Romney sold himself very well and I in fact found myself agreeing with
   a lot of the things he was saying.

   Unfortunately, had he been debating himself from 6 or 8 months ago, I
   fear he would have drawn equally contrasting lines *with what he
   himself has previously stated*.

   It certainly sounds nice to hear that he'll create 12 million jobs and
   generate a surplus and maintain or lower taxes and increase military
   spending ... but the *reality* of the matter is that many of these
   claims are either mutually exclusive at face value *or* they require
   draconic austerity in programs that qualify us as a First World Nation.

   Sadly the general public doesn't pay enough attention to recognize the
   snake oil salesman, especially when Obama brought his B- game, at best.
   Much of the blame here goes to Obama. Not only was he stylistically
   off, rambling on tangents, not sharply stating important points, not
   nailing Romney at various opportunities ("Someone making millions,
   without even working should not be paying a 14 or 13% tax rate ... if
   it's even that high, we don't know because Romney won't release his
   returns! How can we trust that he'll improve tax policy for middle
   class citizens at his own expense?") etc. but his demeanor was rather
   poor. He looked defeated. He would not look at Romney nearly often
   enough, and head-down smirking should be reserved for off-camera
   moments. They do not bode well given the plight of the average person.

   I think Romney did a great job of looking extremely concerned and as if
   he felt bad for Obama, giving the sense that Romney knew he was in over
   his head. Frankly Obama should have been looking angrily at Romney the
   entire night. He should be angry at the political game being played and
   about the consequences of losing. He should be angry and defiant in the
   face of the Romney machine. Burying his head and occasionally smirking
   at remarks (however smirk-worthy) was not a winning strategy,
   stylistically.

   Talking directly to the American people makes no difference if the face

   He's campaigned as a fancy empty suit, he debates as a fancy empty

   More specifically, Nate Silver puts the bump on winning the first
   debate at 1-2%, based on data going back to Carter. With Obama up 4%
   going in, that's not enough.

   To further cite Nate's Sunday football analogy, Mitt was down 7 with 10
   minutes to go. He just scored a field goal. But the clock is ticking,
   and Obama has the ball.

   People, including myself wanted the POTUS to jump in that fire, play
   Romney's game. we could make analogies and metaphors all day to the
   effect. Sticking to the fire thing... Romney just burned all the oxygen
   in the room, ( he has nothing left but the lies he spewed ) He melted
   that marshmallow mediator who would be fired right along with Big Bird.
   Our President came in with an oxygen supply of his own, grinned and
   bared it, stated facts, calmly, (albeit hesitantly at times), Allowing
   Romney to do what he does best. Romney is either going to be held
   accountable for the onslaught of lies and insult to the intellect of
   the American middle class or, he could be President. I have more faith
   in WE THE PEOPLE than that. Romney's run to the center was mind
   blowing. I live in Florida and have a very educated opinion on just how
   fast a man in flip flops can run... Our sand is sweeter than the

   have him going against a Liberal ideologue who is hard=headed and wants
   his way. You folks in the media have pampered his butt for 4
   years-REFUSING to hold his feet to the fire when he is wrong. Why did
   it take UNIVISION to ask the tough questions?? The VAST majority of
   Americans reside 'middle-right', whether you like or not and most folks
   would like their President to reside-philosophically in the same
   neighborhood or at least the same STATE. Prez Obama does NOT represent
   the majority of Americans. To top it off, He CANNOT defend his

   President Obama lost the debate last night -- and he may changed the
   outcome of the election. If the latter is true, its not because of the
   what he has accomplished in his first term or because his path for the
   future not the better path. He lost it because Romney was successful in
   doing what he did to every Republican that got in his way: Romney said
   whatever he needed to say to undercut his opponent - and very
   selectively threw in a data point here and there to make it sound like
   he had the "specifics" for which voters are asking.

   Romney successfully and skillfully used small bits of data to
   characterize the President's administration as having failed in jobs
   growth, tax policy, the deficit, the plight of the middle class,
   housing - just about every aspect of the economy that means something
   to the average voter.

   The President failed to attack Romney on the facts, and more
   importantly, on credibility. The President allowed Romney to focus on
   the number of people hurting out there rather than the consistent
   improvement in unemployment. He allowed Romney to talk about taking
   $17B from Medicare rather than the hidden costs of hospital emergency
   care that are passed along to the rest of us through higher health care
   insurance premiums. He allowed Romney to misstate that his health
   insurance plan would allow all children up to 26 years of age to stay
   on they parents' health insurance plans. He allowed Romney to never
   need to make the budget numbers to add up while reversing his previous
   statements about tax breaks for everyone, wealthy or middle class. The
   President failed to perform like an arrogant, bombastic bulls--- artist
   like Rush Limbaugh, Donald Trump, and Rudy Giuliani. And the President
   allowed Romney to successfully do his imitation of them.

   It seems to me that the President's advisers did not anticipate the
   threat and did not prepare the President well. They decided to have the
   President be "presidential" rather than prepare him for an alley fight.

   The President will recover but it will take more focus, more resolve,
   more clarity, and more toughness that anyone could have even imagined
   just 12 hours ago. I would like to see an ad campaign that ruthlessly
   compares Romney's statements last night to what he has been saying
   leading up to the debate.

   Obama phoned it in until later on when it finally dawned on him that
   Romney was landing punches. What we saw last night was Romney, in a
   hyper state, lying with a straight face, repeating them as he realized
   that no one was calling him on them. If Obama was rope-a-doping, then
   it was a bad game plan.

   The next debates will have Schieffer and Crowley as moderators, and
   they, as the conservatives that they are, will stack the deck against
   Obama in their moderation. Obama is going to have to show up in person
   for those two debates. (Also, just a pet-peeve: Mr President, please
   lose the "aaand" verbal tic that showed up over and over again in your
   replies.)

   The reason Romney did well in presentation -not substance- is because
   he is good at being a CEO going before a Board or being Chairman of the
   Board and making a presentation. Romney has to be in control and
   scripted, when he is he performs well otherwise he gets into trouble.
   Romney could not handle a crisis because he would not have control and
   it would not be scripted. Even his wife worries about his well being.
   He talks to the American People every time he gives a stomp speech or
   an interview. Obama did have a poor showing - he had openings to call
   Romney out and he did not.

   I only caught part of the debates and I agree Obama was flat. What I
   will say about Romney is what some of you folks have already stated: he
   will say ANYTHING to get elected. If you see some of his previous
   interviews from the 1990s and 2000s, he says that he used to say
   anything to close a deal, because the goal was to close the deal. He
   would deal with the specifics later. Same true here...the Presidency
   for Mitt is nothing more than another business goal. But just because
   you say it, Mitt, doesn't mean it's true. Unfortunately, in a land of
   Honey Boo Boos, that might be enough.

   Romney did win hands down. I am an Obama supporter. Obama did not show

   opportunities to counter Romney's change of position on taxes and
   health care. Obama seemed to think the facts would win the debate for
   him. But he failed to defend the facts. I am disappointed, but I think
   he will bounce back strong in the next debates :( He could at least
   have asked if that is going to be his plan tomorrow. I noticed that

   absolutely as "mainstream" as network news, MSNBC, and the "liberal

   "Hitler was a great speaker too. Charismatic and had the German people

   Bingo! The comparison is spot on! I would slightly modify the
   comparison, though. Romney showed the stridency and belligerence that
   Hitler started to show once he came to power, becoming worse and worse
   until he eventually became a grotesque parody of an orator. I'm not
   making excuses for the President...he was flat and too subdued.
   However, I'm not about to agree with the fatuous hosannas I've been
   seeing about Romney. As one would expect of someone who is at best
   basically a sociopath, Romney came across as very unpleasant. Those on
   the right love that sort of thing, though. They routinely act as though

   The debate was quite a spectacle, but "crushed" is not the operational
   world to describe the event unless one is given to sound and fury that
   signifies nothing. I did hear a more forceful voice from Mr. Romney,
   and I did see a flat no drama Obama, but I did not hear anything that
   satisfied my want to know who Mitt Romney is!

   He meandered, rather firmly, into a political landscape of his own
   making, and said things that contradicted what he has been saying on
   the campaign trail. I saw a man who would be president tell me he is
   for everything good, and against everything bad - and then, if you
   wish, worked the bad to crush President Obama.

   I still don't know anything more about Mitt Romney! Is he a tax cheat?
   How can he deny Obamacare is modeled after and performs very much like
   Romneycare? His talk of bi-partisanship is belied by Mitch McConnell's
   boast that he will make Barack Obama a one term president! Does he know
   math? Is his Ryan Plan good for our nation? Can he accomplish things
   simply by saying he can?

   Ah, and riddle me this: Mitt Romney condemns government in its many
   functions and in particular in its ability to employ people, give them
   wages and help them support their families. So how does he brazenly
   think he can get away with telling me such tripe, and then tell me in
   the same breath, vote for me, make me president, and I will use the
   instruments of government to create 12 million jobs?

   Answer, as soon as the Republicans regain power, the federal purse
   strings will be drawn open and government funding of a new corporate
   order will begin in all due deliberate fashion! -Kevo

   It's hard to argue with bold face lies. I think the President was in
   shock that he was facing an opponent that was actually using lies in
   front of a live audience. If Obama seemed off his game, it was likely
   because he was trying to figure out how to respond without getting down

   even not pitiful. A disheartening and disappointing performance.

   I don't know. Yes, he was flat, but I actually think this could work to
   his advantage. I think alot of deems (myself included) were feeling so
   good about the election that they were starting to take a win for
   granted. I think this may motivate the base to turnout, work and

   Seems to be two camps here; Romney won but he lied, and Obama lost but
   he told the truth. One big problem I see is the number of ads that can
   be cut from the debate showing Romney looking very presidential, and
   Obama looking like a sour puss.

   You don't get to claim victory in a debate when you change your
   positions from ones that you've established for the past 1-2 years.
   This reinforces the 'flip-flopper' label that Romney has earned with
   his changing positions. Where does he stand? Bush voters of 2004,
   what's your excuse for voting for Romney? He's a bigger flip-flopper
   than Kerry and you wouldn't vote for Kerry for the same reason? No one
   should listen to hypocrites or flip-floppers.

   As an informed voter, Romney didn't impress me or convince me to vote
   for him. He did not win the debate because like you say, Steve, Romney
   failed in substance and took any position he felt like taking and that
   alone should disqualify him for president.

   But Obama FAILED to call him out on it. All the lies, all the position
   changes yet again, all the obnoxious things Romney-Ryan think and want
   to do, all of it, Obama failed to press the case. No mention of the
   47%. No mention of Ryan's 70%. No pushback on the Medicare $716 billion
   lie. No mention of the Republican obstruction they have prosecuted. No
   making it known to the nation the Romney campaign is nothing but
   manufactured lies. None. Nothing. Nadda.

   If you're not DISGUSTED with Obama right now, there's something wrong
   with you. He acted just like the loser Democrat of the last 20+ years,
   letting a bully and liar run right over his a$$. Mr. Nice Guy, Mr.

     Obama can get his licks in and there's nothing Romney could do about
     it.

   So, Romney couldn't continue to lie?

   Do you think there would have come any point in the debate where Rombey
   would have admitted he was lying? Romney made up studies that claim his
   tax plan works, out of thin air. You know he lied, I know he lied, but
   to uninformed aka undecideds, it would have been a he said she said all
   night long. Romney would have never relented from the lie.

   But, I do believe the video evidence will be the undoing of Romney in
   the coming days and weeks to come. Romney changed his entire platform
   last night. Was Obama supposed to be prepared for that? Should he have
   prepared for Mitt 3.0, Mitt 4.0, etc?

   It's not easy debating a liar that does not have a moral compass. It is
   doubly difficult to do it with the MSM telling the viewing audience
   that his lie filled "performance" was good.

   @Derek: I don't think Obama lost the "debate" per se. At least not on
   the substance. What he lost was the effective functional purpose of the
   "debate." He lost the chance to paint an accurate picture of reality to
   those irresponsible citizens who were tuning in for the first time. He
   lost by letting Romney appear -- and only appear -- to be the one in
   command of what is good for the country and who has the best ideas. He
   FAILED to expose the malignancy that is the three R's of America:
   Romney-Ryan-Republican. He simply let a liar and a bully convince
   ignoramuses that the malignancy has a point. It doesn't.

   @rollo: C'mon man. Seriously? Do I think Romney would have admitted
   lying? Are you fu king serious? It doesn't matter if Romney admits it.
   Of course he's not going to admit it. But wouldn't it have been nice if
   Obama actually said that Romney was a lying sack of shhit (in so many
   words) and pressed it forcefully. The headlines would be a hell of a
   lot different today and the race would be over.

   Look, here's what happened last night. Romney knows without a shadow of
   a doubt the base is voting for him. He could become Mao or Che and they
   would vote for him. And you know it. So that long awaited shift to the
   middle that was expected a long time ago but was impossible for him
   till he solidified his base? It just happened.

   Obama should have been in his face. But he was too busy doodling on his
   notepad and too intimidated to confront a liar and a bully because the
   audacity of the lying took the breath out of him. Are you gonna tell me
   Obama and Democrats, at this point, should not expect
   Romney-Ryan-Republicans to lie? And not to know how to handle it?

   You're right Rollo. I messed up on your intent of that post I responded
   to. I'm really pissed off right now after that disaster last night.
   Sorry I didn't take enough time on your post before I began another
   rant.

   As for how Obama should have behaved? I definitely think he should have
   been just as forceful -- make that more forceful -- defending the truth
   and attacking Romney's lies and position changes as Romney was in
   pressing his lies and position changes. And every time Romney repeated
   a lie, Obama should have called him on it, and challenged the press --
   explicitly -- to do the fact-checking item for item.

   Yes, that's what I think would have been better than what happened. The
   headlines would be a lot different today if he had. We see what the
   alternative looks like. To think it has to be that way, to think Obama
   did the best that could be done in that situation, is to think that
   lies and liars always win. I will NEVER believe that.

   As for Sharpton, well, he had some good lines (fish keeping it's mouth
   closed can't get caught, etc), and he did a good job, but ..., the
   opportunity for Obama was lost. Who knows if Romney sealed the deal
   with some ignoramuses last night. And he has pumped up his supporters
   at a time that Obama could have dealt a death blow to the Romney
   campaign. Now the money will keep pouring in. The press and media are
   all tingly that they got themselves a horserace.

   This race should be over. It's not. And it's not because of Obama
   timidity. Same ol' story.

   As for ThinkProgress and all the fact-checking: Yes, I know. But will
   the irresponsibly inattentive know? That's what's important. These
   people aren't impressed by all that sissy fact-checking. They're into
   hormones and body language and appearances. And that's where Obama
   failed. Miserably.

   i disagree with the comment that the President failed to counter Mr.
   Romney's falsehoods. There were multiple times where Pres. Obama stated
   that what Mr. Romney just said is the exact opposite of what he's been
   running on the past 18months (tax cut for top, repeal ACA and replace).
   He also called him out for all the pandering to popular things about
   the ACA and other reforms (regulations are the one that stuck out to
   me). i also thought the zingers were weak

   Romney won the style battle, no argument here and i made that case with
   my wife and friend after the debate. However, the way that he ran over
   the moderator at times, and his brash style made Mr. Romney look more
   like a bully than a president (my wife and friends opinion that i have
   to agree with). The President can not afford to get down in the mud and
   be labeled as the 'angry black man' running for reelection. It is
   better for him to face a bit of fallout from his base (who are going to
   turn out regardless) than to give the right wing smear machine
   ammunition for him being 'angry' (Rush was telling his listeners that
   Obama was going to be angry and to watch for it yesterday). President
   Obama did a very good job of keeping his cool and making valid
   arguments for his policies when all Mr. Romney could do is claim the
   President's versions of his plan were just straw men because he says so
   during the debate.

   The serial liar may have looked good, and sounded good, but lies won't
   convince voters that he is on their side, especially after the fact
   checkers get done with him...

   How could he let Willard off the hook from his 47% comment?

   As soon as the word "Solyndra" passed Willard's lips he should've been
   met with a faceful of 47%, but Obama just let it pass. He had numerous
   other times that he should have countered Willard's lies...but,
   nothing...silence...

   I know he doesn't want to be that angry black guy, but to just let

   "Oh well... it's just the first debate" can't be the attitude that

   Hi Disgusted ... I understand where you're coming from. I was angry
   last night. And then I read a bit (a lot) and waited for the results,
   and listened to my MSNBC and started to feel a little better. And then
   I woke up - and the ache was back. I think what I'm feeling is "beat up
   on". It feels like justice or fairness or whatever you call it, is not
   on our side. The Republicans are cheating and getting away with it.
   They are lying and not being punished. And we're sitting here and
   having to "take it" and want someone - our leader - to stand up for us
   and shove a mirror in their face. At least that's what I'm hoping for.
   But then I remember what happened yesterday. THEY reintroduced a video.
   And in that video they highlighted all the things about Obama that they
   know "Americans" are sensitive about. And they relied on the momentum
   of the racist backers to promote this idea that we have, waiting in the
   dark or under our beds, a black, angry President. I don't know if there
   was anyway for the President to win last night. Whatever he did, there
   would be fuel, would you agree? So I'm thinking that our Leader weighed
   his options. And thought this option of being maybe a bit too passive,
   would work out better for him. And in the meantime he just might,
   MIGHT, gather some information that would serve the party (and us) well
   in the days to come. I think it's important for me to remember why I'm
   so angry. It's not just because of this latest debate. It's the
   frustration I feel of how the world seems caught up in some back to the
   past 1960 type racial @!$%# right now. And even though the law has
   stepped in many times, the intimidation, videos, billboards, etc.
   continue. How is that just? So I come in here with like minded people
   who see what is going on. And I rely on the strength of others to get
   me through and to pump me up for the next round. And I, although
   somewhat timidly, have faith our President to see us through this. I
   trust that he knows what he's doing. And that he has our back. And I
   give him a few passes due to the incredible @!$%# he has to wade
   through in order to get it done.

   Dear Mr. President,

   As much as we like our Presidents to be dignified and act presidential,
   doing so carries very little weight with today's electorate. We expect
   fire to be fought with fire, hardball tactics to be met with homerun
   swings, and liars to be called out.

   You didn't do much of that last night, and it may cost you this
   election.

   People loved Harry Truman's no-nonsense approach. When people lied to
   him or about him, he didn't just look down and smirk; he shot right
   back at them with the fury of a prize fighter. Even if that is not your
   nature, we need to see a little - no, a LOT - of Harry in you.

   Take the gloves off. We will not think less of you for it.

   Do not let Mitt Romney lie and buy his way to the White House. We
   cannot afford for you to continue to be cordial and deferential. You
   are the leader; so LEAD.

   Wake up. Obama was an intimidated little girl unwilling to WIN. He's
   simply let a liar and a business bully run right over him.

   What you saw last night is why we're fighting to salvage the 20th
   century instead of the Republicans being out of power for two
   generations like they should be and could have been if Obama had the fu
   king sense a decent politician has to WIN when you can.

   Cowardly?Is it cowardly to debate at a national level?Is it cowardice
   that prevents a man from becoming a "liar,liar pants on fire" child?
   Who was hiding in this debate? Was Obama or Mitt? I say it was Mitt as
   he hid behind his aggressive approach and his veil of lies.

   In truth I have never seen a brave liar.Brazen yes but brave-not
   hardly.

   When a man retreats into his own little world where things are as he
   sees them and not as they are he is running away from reality. Thus
   Mitt should be seen as either a coward or a truly psychotic individual
   in dire need of help.

   It was cowardly to stare at your notepad when a liar is lying right in
   your face and staring at you. cowardly not to call the liar on his lies
   over and over and over. Obama was intimidated. If you couldn't see
   that, I don't know what to tell you. He simply had his breath taken out
   of him when Romney started with all the lies and position changes in
   real time. He had no answer to "trickle down government." He had no
   answer when Romney -- ROMNEY -- called OBAMA the liar. Are you FU KING
   kidding me? Seriously? Who were the idiots prepping him? They needed
   Rahm Emanuel playing Romney instead of Kerry.

   Obama had no choice but to show up. What showed up though was a timid
   man unwilling to deliver the final blow. This race could be over. This
   race SHOULD be over. The only reason it's not over is because of the
   same ol' shhit. Democratic political impotence and incompetence.

   The Republicans have done uncountable damage to the country. How can it
   be that the country is largely unaware of it? You know the answer. How
   can it be that 50% think Romney would do a better job with the economy?
   You know the answer. How could it be that it's roughly a tie on who

   constantly trying to push anti-abortion,anti-gay legislation upon us as
   they deregulate and promote off shoring and try to continue the trickle

   This is no longer a simple decision of who is the best of the worst. It

   Come on you guys. None of us are wasting each other's time! We're

   many of us are pouring over blogs and stats and avoiding social media
   so we don't have to be sickened by the other side running around waving
   their flags singing "We Are The Champions"?

   There wasn't much momentum before, I noticed. People were becoming a
   bit too complacent on our end. We "had this", remember? Well, now it's
   time to sit in here (or out there) and fight, and energize ourselves to
   get busy and direct our anger to the real causes of it. Not to one
   another. Not in here.

   So I'll start - how can President Obama as a leader - stand up against
   this obvious racist bully bull@!$%# and not come off as a lawyer, angry
   black man, or smug? I agree - he HAS to look up. He has to make the
   liar look him in the face. In the eye. I think that might have made me
   feel a bit less of a victim last night if he had just made Mitt look
   him in the eye and lie to him. Don't get me wrong, Mitt still would
   have been able to lie, but there is power in at least maintaining eye
   contact while he does it.

   I think he was writing on his pad so he didn't lose his temper. He
   needs to be coached to not do that as much. And I think they will talk
   to him about that, don't you?

   Romney was obviously targeting low-information voters. And the thing
   about low-information voters is, if they haven't been following the

   Especially if 'Honey Boo-Boo was on. Anyone who follows politics knows
   that basically everything he said last night was a lie. The only thing
   Obama failed at was calling him out on his falsehoods.

   Like most successful Republican's Romney has one face for the masses,
   full of empty promises and fuzzy logic; and another true face for his
   wealthy donors and backroom deals. That is the main difference between
   Republicans and Democrats. You cannot take Republicans at face value,
   while Democrats can be trusted to give you the straight facts of the
   matter.
   Romney gave the illusion of more specifics in the debate that only had
   an impact from the lack of any real specifics that he has been willing
   to offer to the press up until this point. Piece by piece Romey's
   points could be refuted by his own past statements and record; but the
   massive volume of the deluge was somewhat impressive. #1 his promises
   of more jobs was made when he ran for governor of Mass and then quickly
   forgotten when he held the office while Mass ranked 47th in job growth.
   #2 his promise of raising incomes for working Americans demands an
   explanation when his party and his business practices thrive on holding
   back wages and lowering the bottom line on their ledgers in order to
   funnel every available dollar into corporate profits and CEO bonuses.
   President Obama held firm and took the high road; but the onslaught of
   half-truths and empty promises by Romney/Ryan/Rove and Co. has just
   kicked into overdrive.

   I would like to encourage all my fellow Democrats to exhale and
   remember: One debate does not an election make. We progressives are too
   quick to pounce on anything that does not line up with our narrative of
   what "we" think should have happened. I watched this same scenario
   unfold in 2010...and what happened? The Republicans won the House! Why?
   Because many voters stayed home as Progressive commentators and
   bloggers repeatedly attacked the President's inability to move a
   Congress that from the onset of his administration set out to make him
   a failure!

   Mitt Romney is a pathological liar with no core! He is willing to say
   anything, if it serves his own selfish purpose. In the South, we have a
   phrase which describes people like him: "Once a person shows you who
   they are, you better believe him." Mitt Romney has shown his true
   colors over and over again. He didn't fool anyone last night!

   Let us learn from our mistakes of 2010, and stand by our President and
   others Demos who are fighting for the middle class who truly have been
   buried by an avalance of Republicans lies for the past 3 1/2 years.
   President Obama has endured immeasurable disdain and disrespect from
   the other side. Must he now suffer the same from members of his own
   party?

   It's not easy to debate an empty chair with a lot of hot air, but no
   substance. Calm down, relax, and stay the course. Victory is at hand!

   Obama was certainly being very cautious last night. One pundit said

   contemptuous of the man. (See "sighing Gore" 2000).

   And I agree with others that it is hard to debate someone based on
   their records and plans, when they have absolutely no compunction about
   lying, short of saying "liar liar." Which would have made
   low-information voters think Obama was a bully.

   Yes, Romney "won" the debate. Short of tripping over his own tongue,
   it's hard to see how he could have lost, given Obama's defensive

   Obama may have looks sluggish and Romney may have looked sharp, but I
   really do think (and maybe I'm being optimistic here) that "Big Bird"
   will be the real takeaway from this debate.

   That may seem odd and minimalistic, but consider this--what Romney
   highlights is that he wants to balance the federal budget by getting
   rid of funding that is at best .01% of the federal budget, and may be
   as little as .00001%. One-percent of one-percent or one-percent of
   one-percent of one-percent. As Neil deGrasse Tyson puts it, it's like
   clearing space on a 500GB harddrive by deleting text files. Or as I
   would put it, it's like being morbidly overweight and going on a diet
   by eliminating one chocolate chip from your diet per year, and not the
   massive buckets of deep-fried Twinkies.

   What "Big Bird" does, then, is put a cute face on a real problem; Mitt
   Romney is ridiculously disconnected from real math. It also shows that
   he is disconnected from real people. If would be one thing to say
   "We're going to go top to bottom on the budget, and if that means
   cutting funding for PBS, then that's what we may have to do." That gets
   no retweets, and is forgotten.

   Firing Big Bird? Might as well say "I'm going to evict Fred Rogers;
   he'll have to find a new neighborhood."

   Thanks, Rachel, for mentioning substance. I believe that the news media
   has a clear job here. Why are they scoring performance and not
   mentioning the lies and flip flops that Romney is so famous for. Can
   you imagine all his tax cuts adding NOTHING to the deficit? The media
   should demand he tell which loopholes he'd get rid of. After all, don't
   we, as voters, need to know? Will it be my mortgage deduction, or those
   for my children? These will affect the middle class, a group that
   suddenly he cares so much about. I still believe in Obama and in his
   honesty. If you turned off the sound and looked at Romney when he was
   quiet, this is a man we cannot trust.

   The MSM has done a magnificent job in not mentioning the lies and flip
   flops of the Grand Campaigner. I don't feel there's any hope they'll
   start now, even to save the future of their own country, let alone
   ours.

   The smell of profitting from another Republican in office must be
   intoxicating the media moguls in their crystal towers. They aren't
   going to help a Democrat.

   'Perception' is what matters in a Presidential debate, not 'substance'.
   The people who are going to be impacted by that debate are not going to
   fact check what each candidate said, that's the job of the opposing
   debaters. Romney did his, Obama didn't.

   Perhaps we nominated the wrong Democrat in 08. Maybe we got taken in by
   pretty speeches and promises. The Liberal agenda has been watered down
   and compromised for 4 years, Obama refusing to defend it on stage last
   night wasn't a glitch, it was a pattern.

   I, personally, would like to see a Jeopardy-style debate format.

   Wouldn't it be so awesome to see Alex Trebek say "Oooh, sorry. That's
   wrong." when one of the candidates makes a bogus claim?

   (Potential answers we'll here from the great AT: The correct answer was
   "What is the 47%?" And we all know that only AT can pronounce Mahmoud
   Ahmadienijad in correct intonation.)

   You could get your fact checking and debate moderation in one swoop.

   Tricia, make it happen, champ. ;-)

   Oops, I meant for this to be on Tricia McKinney's post.

   And I meant "hear" instead of "here". Or maybe I meant "hair". Hmmmmmm.

   THe president cannot afford to have another debate night like the one
   in Denver. Sadly, voters and pundits appear to be giving Mitt full
   cover for the dozens of flip-flops and complete evasions of detail he
   found himself in last night. Romney disavowed his entire tax plan, then
   reaffirmed his support for cutting taxes for the rich, said he doesn't
   think government should have a say in Medicare, and refused to say how
   he would create 12 million jobs other than with "deductions." But
   Obama's apathy stole the show. Part of it was his attempt to remain
   "likable," but his reserve lapsed into peevishness and disinterest much
   of the evening. Where was his comeback that Mitt thinks health care is
   fine if we just parcel off the uninsured to emergency rooms at taxpayer
   expense? The polls will be tied next week, although how much of it is
   caused by Denver is hard to say. - [380]progressive

   Yup. Mitt handed him some unmitigated openings he could have used with
   confidence and truth.

   Obama really needs wide margins to prevent the opportunity of any
   accidental cheating at the election. Debates like this will keep those
   margins far too close.

   I don't know. I listened to the debate on the radio, and I came away
   with a big "meh." Nothing really new to think about, the usual
   "etch-a-sketch" comments from Romney (he will say anything to get
   elected), the usual stilted reasonableness from Obama (his willingness
   to be reasonable is a political weakness in our partisan environment).
   I learned nothing I didn't already know about the candidates.

   The only thing Romney did was to lie louder and be more obnoxious than
   anyone. I still say "Where's the beef?". I turned off the sound and
   watched the body language...basically the bully in romney was forefront
   and the mellow Obammer was too mellow in making his points. It seems
   Romney bullied the moderator (who should be put out to pasture after
   this performance), and wouldn't let up. I just hope Barry (the hoops
   player) shows up for the next debate and starts stuffing the ball down
   romney's throat.

   Very interesting point, I noticed that also. I had the TV muted because
   I was watching the expanded debate on democracynow.org. I would glance
   over at the TV at times and it was weird to watch.

   This is becoming just too disgusting with Republicans, when you know
   that Romney is more or less a criminal on income tax evasion in which
   he was given a waiver so he would finally pay his taxes and probably
   still lied on how much money he had. If the average person did that
   they would be nailed to the wall as they were jailed or penalized to
   the hilt. The Republicans sit there and act like Romney is a great guy,
   especially on Morning Joe promoting Romney who would steal you blind
   and should be in the White House. What the heck does Republicans do
   encourage people to be non-Americans and criminals. This is just too
   sickening to even watch as you see how low these Republicans can go.
   Hate to say it, but it is becoming just too difficult to even watch
   someone like Joe talking his load of crap. Republicans want people to
   be criminals by being so greedy that you will lie, cheat and steal
   anyway you can just to get rich, even if it destroys our environment
   and the very health and welfare of other people. Republicans would
   prefer to tell you what to do as they lie through their teeth, but live
   by a whole set of different standards that is sick as it gets.
