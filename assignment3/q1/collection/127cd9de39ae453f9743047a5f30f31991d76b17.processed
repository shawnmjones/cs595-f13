[24]Putting 'IRS higher-ups' and 'conservative groups' in a headline doesn't
make it news

   IRS Seal
   NBC appears to believe [30]that this is some kind of scoop, but it
   actually isn't news:

     Additional scrutiny of conservative organizations' activities by the
     IRS did not solely originate in the agency's Cincinnati office, with
     requests for information coming from other offices and often bearing
     the signatures of higher-ups at the agency, according to attorneys
     representing some of the targeted groups. At least one letter
     requesting information about one of the groups bears the signature
     of Lois Lerner, the suspended director of the IRS Exempt
     Organizations department in Washington.

     Jay Sekulow, an attorney representing 27 conservative political
     advocacy organizations that applied to the Internal Revenue Service
     for tax-exempt status, provided some of the letters to NBC News.  He
     said the groups' contacts with the IRS prove that the practices went
     beyond a few "front line" employees in the Cincinnati office, as the
     IRS has maintained.

   Here's two reasons this isn't news. First, The Washington Post
   [31]already reported this information two weeks ago, albeit with a
   report that didn't read like a press release from Jay Sekulow.

   Second, and more importantly, it's not a "scandal" if the IRS asks
   groups applying for special tax status to verify their eligibility. If
   you want special privileges, you're going to have to be willing to
   substantiate your claims. When the IRS asks a group applying for
   501(c)(4) status to prove that it is entitled to that status, that's
   the IRS [32]doing its job.

   The problem comes if some groups are treated differently than other
   groups because of their political belief. But that doesn't mean the IRS
   should rubber-stamp the applications of political groups--it just means
   that left or right, all political groups should be on a level playing
   field.

   There's no question that the laws here are a mess, and the regulations
   surrounding them aren't any better. But those laws and regulations
   require the IRS to ask these kinds of questions. As long as they are on
   the books, political groups that seek non-profit status are going to
   have to be prepared to provide answers. It's not surprising that
   lawyers like Jay Sekulow would try to blur the line between the IRS
   doing its job and its unacceptable targeting practices, but NBC really
   should know better than to be his stenographer.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Woke up to Morning Ho today, where Sekulow's propaganda piece was
       presented as if it were objective news.  Klein was given a chance
       to opine, and he characterized the presentation as a mess.
       He properly distinguished between the partisan targeting of Tea
       Party groups, which is wrong and dangerous as an IRS activity; the
       investigation of those groups once targeted, though, Klein rightly
       pointed out was IRS properly doing its job.  Referral of these
       groups initiated investigation of them, which was apparently done
       at other levels.  This is apparently what Sekulow is trying to
       claim is broadening the scandal, but Klein asserts there is nothing
       scandalous in IRS asking questions of these groups, and it isn't a
       broadening of the scandal at all because there was no wrongdoing at
       this level of IRS.
       The scandal, of course, is that political groups are getting their
       501c4 designations approved at all, but the Beltway apparently
       isn't ready to take this leap.

 I agree that there are two issues, as Klein said. ([143]6+ / 0-)

       I think, however, that some people here would have more credibility
       if the, like Klein, recognized this fact:

     He properly distinguished between the partisan targeting of Tea
     Party groups, which is wrong and dangerous as an IRS activity
       Sometimes I see people, especially some people here, try to ignore
       that point and jump immediately to point two:  that the IRS had an
       obligation to investigate groups that raised scrutiny on grounds
       OTHRER THAN the fact that they had conservative ideologies.
       When you respond to point 1 solely by jumping immediately to point
       2 (without any recognition of the completely unacceptable and
       dangerous action by the IRS in point 1), it sounds like you are
       trying to rationalize away point 1.  And that looks hypocritical,
       implying that it's ok to do it to them because they are
       conservative anyway.
       If you really believe both points, you should want rectification of
       both points.  You can advocate for stronger limits on 501(c)(4)
       status.  Absolutely.  Completely.  But you also must want a full
       investigation to find out who it was at the IRS that initiated, or
       instigated, the "wrong and dangerous" activity by the IRS.  That
       "wrong and dangerous" activity is a huge concern in and of itself.

       People who claim that political targeting by the IRS, at whatever
       level, is not a scandal are just plain wrong.  They're letting
       partisan blinders obscure the obvious.
       There are four aspect to this scandal:
       1. Local targeting of right-wing groups for investigation, which is
       a scandal.
       2.  Investigation of targeted groups, which so far appears entirely
       proper.
       3. Granting these groups 501c4 status, which is much more of a
       scandal.
       4. Political grandstanding by Republicans and immediate caving by
       the president, which are dishearteningly familiar.
       It's useful to keep all these separate aspects in mind, because
       they all have very distinct implications.

       key, it seems to me.
       When you immediately move to "but groups with political ideologies
       shouldn't get 501(c)(4) status and the law should be changed,"  It
       looks like you are trying to change the subject, or sweep scandal
       #1 under the rug.  Trying too hard to link the two makes it looks
       like you are implying that what the IRS did was ok, it's just the
       law that's bad.
       By the way, whether scandal #1 was "local" is part of the issue.
       Remember, the Cinn office was the national office for 501(c)(4)'s.
        And Sekulow (who is filing an extensive federal complaint this
       morning) says he has letters and documentation from other offices,
       from Washington, and signed by Levin.  We'll have to see.

 Political ideology on its face is an alert flag. ([174]3+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:

       What activities the group seeking preferential tax treatment
       proposes to engage in - and will, in fact do - with its ideology is
       very much the business of the IRS.
       That, to me, is the first question about applying for tax exempt
       status.
       In this charged environment, among the next questions are:
       - Have groups with conservative ideologies been selected
       disproportionately for scrutiny?
       - Have they included in their application the purposeful "tests"
       the [178]New York Times article reported? (i.e. invited scrutiny to
       test the law, to get publicity that Fox & Co. is so willing to
       give?)
       I'm willing to believe a reputable lawyer's representations about
       facts, but the fact that he represents 27 conservative groups who
       have filed applications for 501c status suggests he might not only
       be knowledgable but a very involved party and possibly (!) even an
       advocate.
       What is hurting the IRS now is its failure to come forth. True, it
       doesn't usually disclose operational details, but this is an
       inherently contentious area (whatever ones ideology). These charges
       are serious and deserve more visibility.

       May we not know them by their chosen names and ask the next

       considerable tax advantages, cannot?
       For me, Tea Party says ideology, political ideology. And that
       ideology may well edge into real, honest, straightforward,
       non-objectionable political activity such as registering voters,
       holding rallies with candidates as guests or speakers, a website
       with links to conservative political action groups. It may be that
       some or all of these are not enough - in kind or degree - to
       disallow 501c status.
       But political ideology alone, for me, is definitely enough to ask
       some further questions in the application stage, particularly, so
       representations about the group's plans are on the record, and more
       than just a name.
       And Yes, The IRS should engage in the same analysis of liberal,

 How do you know? ([215]2+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [216]jfromga, [217]Larsstephens

       There are no stats on this that I know of. The issue is - did the
       IRS disproportionately target conservative groups for extra
       analysis? Over the past few years, it would not be at all
       surprising if the universe of 501c applications has been heavily
       skewed with conservative groups.
       But if there are trigger words and phrases - and yes, your chosen
       name can be a signal - that suggest political activity, it is
       absolutely a fair question (and under the existing regs, a
       necessary one) about the nature and extent of political activities.
       Bottom line: I don't think the IRS "is not supposed to target
       [insert species] for ideology." I don't think the IRS should be
       walled off from inquiring about the political activities of a
       politically ideological group for the purposes of granting or
       refusing tax exempt status.
       Tea Party preceding "Sewing Circle" or "Health Club" or "Tea Party
       Activists Book Club" - without a declaration of purposes or
       activities  (the 501c application form asks for this) that touch
       politics - shouldn't invoke more scrutiny than would normally be
       triggered by the rest of the application and the organizing
       documents that are attached.  For example, Question 15 on the IRS
       form asks:

     Has the organization spent or does it plan to spend any money
     attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or
     appointment of any person to any Federal, state, or local public
     office or to an office in a political organization? If "Yes,"
     explain in detail and list the amounts spent or to be spent in each
     case.
       But if the name is, say, "Tea Party Activists of NW Illinois" or
       "Progressive Activists of NW Illinois", the IRS does not have to be
       made blind or stupid about what to look for or what more to ask.

 TRPC - names should never be used to sort apps ([221]0+ / 0-)
       The content of the application must be the focus of the IRS review
       process. Subjecting any group for special attention based on a name
       is wrong. Subjecting only conservative groups based on key words in
       their names is completely unacceptable, as President Obama has made
       very clear. We need to know how this started, who knew about it,
       who approved it and how it was implemented.

 Really? ([225]0+ / 0-)
       I would think that the (hypothetical) application of the "Committee
       to Reelect the President" for 501(c)(4) status should go to the
       "give this one a closer look" pile right away.
       I think you are confusing profiling (usually racial) with applying
       rational criteria.  The name of a 501(c)(4) applicant is not chosen
       in a vacuum;  the name, in and of itself, conveys meaningful
       information about the activities of the applicant.
       Furthermore, there is a question on Form 1024 that asks, "Has the
       organization spent or does it plan to spend any money attempting to
       influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of
       any person to any Federal, state, or local public office or to an
       office in a political organization."  If a Tea Party (or Progress
       Now affiliate) answered yes to that question, it clearly would have
        warranted further scrutiny to determine if it complies wiht the
       limits on electoral activity.  On the other hand, if it answered no
       to that question, it also would have warranted further scrutiny,
       since it was pretty clear that Tea Party affiliates were heavily
       involved in electoral activity.

       None of yours, or my opinion on what they did matters. What matters
       is the rules they themselves must follow. They didn't. They found
       out. They admitted it. There is an investigation underway to
       determine the size and scope. Accept it and move on. I would think
       you would want to make sure that in the future that they wouldn't
       target liberal groups or anyone else unfairly.  Defending this is
       really a mystery to me.

     "the name, in and of itself, conveys meaningful information about
     the activities of the applicant.
       "
       It doesn't matter what you think the name means. They apply, they
       fill out the application. It is reviewed. In these cases extra
       scrutiny and delays were invoked not because of anything they
       provided on their application but only because of their name.
       Perhaps you are uninformed and did not know this but 501(c) (4) can
       be ideological and political- but they can't devote more than 50%
       of their efforts to electioneering for specific candidates. Yes
       they are ideological but that is well within the rules. Targeting
       them because of their ideology is not.

       I am all in favor of thorough review, but based on the application
       and if they answered yes to certain question applications deserve
       more review. That's OK, but that isn't what happened in practice.
       Applications with Tea Party names were set aside for more review
       based on nothing but their name. That was wrong, which the IRS has
       admitted. Why is this even a question any more. The IRS, the
       Treasury Dept and the President have all stated, clearly, with no
       qualification, that what the IRS did was wrong.

       If Tea Party groups were set aside because of their ideology, that
       would violate the first amendment.  But that wasn't what happened.
       The Tea Party branding that the groups chose clearly advertised
       that they were intending to engage in political advocacy.  Can you

   And your reasoning is either disingenuous or uninformed.

   The forms are received  and reviewed. Then either accepted, rejected or
   asked for more information. The IRS specifically targeted conservative
   groups for EXTRA scrutiny (the latter case) without regard to their
   application- but based only on the key words they used. That is

       because it lumps together ALL applications that were given "extra
       scrutiny.  Extra scrutiny based on something in your specific in
       their application, like checking "yes" to the question of whether
       they intended to participate in elections, is completely proper.
       The IRS always did extra scrutiny based on something specific in
       the application. so the groups singled out for that - a completely
       proper thing to do -- are in that number you cite.
       What is at issue here is that, at some point, the IRS ALSO started
       screening for extra scrutiny based on words used in the name -- and
       all the words used in the screening were words associated with
       conservative ideology. In other words, if you used the words "tea
       party," "patriot,' or "9/12" in your name, you were very likely to
       be selected for extra scrutiny regardless of whether there was
       anything in your application that merited extra scrutiny. That's
       what the IRS admitted to.  That was completely indefensible.
       The better question would be, of the groups selected for extra
       scrutiny based on a word used in the name (rather than something in
       their application that was flagged), how many were conservative
       groups?

       As it turns out, using those terms was more than 82% accurate

       whether a group warranted the additional scrutiny.  On the other
       hand, even when the IRS used its xray vision to scrutinize
       applications, the accuracy was only 67%.

 the IG's report ([286]0+ / 0-)

   seems to indicate that the stalling wasn't done so much to stop right
   wing groups, but because nobody knew what to do, that when the lower
   level folks figured out they needed help it was a long time in coming,
   and they just held on to the applications.

   No, it shouldn't have been done that way, it shouldn't take a year to
   get something from one part of the agency to another and get the answer
   back. Why did it take months to go from one specialist assigned to
   these files to several?

   I think it is great that you come at this in good faith from a 'better
   government' point of view and want the administrative agencies to know
   their stuff and do things right and be efficient.  Remember that much
   of what is happening in the actual debate is not about good government.
    It is not about improving the IRS and its performance.    If everyone
   talking about this was acting in good faith, then I would be for
   yelling and screaming and waving my hands around too, it is fun to jump
   on the tax man.   But some of the comments and some of the
   investigation isn't in good faith, it isn't about good government or
   making the IRS better,  the right wing perspective is merely to fan the
   flames and try to pin this on the WH by throwing as much dirt as
   possible without any basis.

   So I think it behooves us hear to speak carefully and accurately and
   not just jump on the bandwagon of IRS was very very bad but examine the
   context.  If this is not politically motivated, but certainly grossly
   incompetent, it is one level of problem.   If it was deliberate
   political targeting, then we have another problem altogether.  Nothing
   so far shows political motivation or ill motive at all, just crass
   incompetence.  Supporting the idea that investigation will turn up
   political motives leading to the WH is speaking in Right Wing Frames
   and we owe it to ourselves as persons who believe in good government
   not to happily follow the wingers over a cliff.

       any more than I do. It's possible, even probable, that applications
       that didn't require additional information were processed while IRS
       employees were waiting for responses from those requiring further
       information. It's not "targeting" to request information that
       proves an organization conforms to the requirements of this very
       special tax treatment.
       Note: I was an eligibility worker for the welfare dept. Each
       program had its own laws to determine eligibility. I couldn't
       approve an application until I had sufficient information to
       determine eligibility. Not only did I feel a personal obligation to
       act properly, but the federal government requires the states to
       have a QC unit. Error rates were reported, and high ones definitely
       frowned upon. Were there clients who felt they were being targeted?
       Probably.

       [388]USA Today:

     In February 2010, the Champaign Tea Party in Illinois received
     approval of its tax-exempt status from the IRS in 90 days, no
     questions asked.

     That was the month before the Internal Revenue Service started
     singling out Tea Party groups for special treatment. There wouldn't
     be another Tea Party application approved for 27 months.
     In that time, the IRS approved perhaps dozens of applications from
     similar liberal and progressive groups, a USA TODAY review of IRS
     data shows.
     As applications from conservative groups sat in limbo, groups with
     liberal-sounding names had their applications approved in as little
     as nine months. With names including words like "Progress" or
     "Progressive," the liberal groups applied for the same tax status
     and were engaged in the same kinds of activities as the conservative
     groups.

     Someone said, let's pull out those we know are political

   Instead, it seems like what they said is, "let's pull out those we know
   have a conservative/tea party ideology, and do those first."

   If what you say is correct (that they were just looking for political
   ideology of any kind), in addition to the words they used -- "tea
   party," "patriot," "9/12," --  they ALSO would have added words like
   "progressive" "progress" and "occupy." There's no claim that they did
   so.

   Also, if the point was to process things as quickly and expeditiously
   as possible, why (if the allegations are true) did they stall
   applications from conservative groups for a year or more?

   And, more importantly, whose idea was all of this?

   We don't have all the answers.  But the allegations are serious enough
   that we deserve those answers.  If you brush this under the rug, then
   you are essentially saying that it's ok for someone to do that to

 501(c)(4) Inherently Ideological/Political ([494]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [495]VClib, [496]coffeetalk

   If an organization were strictly a social benefit organization such as
   general education, providing health services, medical research, helping
   the poor, garden club, etc., it would file as 501(c)(3), so its
   contributors could deduct contributions on their personal income tax
   returns - which should make a significant increase in their donations,
   and not being able to engage in electoral politics would not be much of
   a constraint on what they want to do.

   If the organization wanted to be exclusively trying to elect people to
   office they would file as 501(c)(5).  Donors do not get a tax deduction
   and donor information is made public.

   Organizations choose to be 501(c)(4), so they can engage in politics
   and ideology and even electoral politics and not be required to make
   donor information public while donors do not get a tax deduction on
   their contributions.  The restriction however is that spending directly
   on elections must be less than 50%.

   As a piratical matter, approving 501(c)(4)s is an issue of campaign
   finance and whether the donors are publicly disclosures, it is not
   about what taxes the government collects.   If the organization is not
   approved for a 501(c)(4), it either cuts back on electoral politics so
   it does qualify or it becomes a 501(c)5.

   This is why you will not find 501(c)(4)s that are not political.

   targeting before the scandal broke, it recognized on its own that it
   had screwed up.  Its apology basically broke the scandal, which the
   IG's report confirms was relatively small, relatively contained,
   investigated and changed insufficiently to satisfy the IG, but
   nevertheless, the IG determined on its own that 69% of the targeted
   groups with tea party or other right wing names, did not meet the
   critieria for tax exempt status.

   Sometimes the government does the wrong thing.  I bet, every day,
   somewhere, some administrative employee in government, makes a mistake
   and misapplies the law.  Most of those mistakes are never found.

   What is making this scandal a scandal, as opposed to other scandals
   where the higher ups in an administration really did target their
   political enemies, is that apparently this didn't come out of the White
   House.   And the wingers can't let that go, so they have to keep

       start and when did it end; (3) what, exactly, did they do for that
       extra screening -- was it (as some now allege) dragging their feet
       for months, asking some improper questions?  and who initiated
       that?
       The IG report was an audit, not an investigation of improper
       behavior.  It didn't answer those kinds of questions.  Something
       this "wrong and dangerous" (as Ezra Klein put it this morning)
       warrants a full investigation to answer those questions.  That's
       the only way there can be any comfort that the problem is fixed and
       that it won't happen again -- like to target progressive groups
       if/when there is a change in ideology by someone in a position to
       initiate something like this.
       I think the public is entitled to those answers on something as
       clearly unacceptable as the IRS using political ideology as a basis
       for differential treatment.  The public does not have to accept,
       "Some unnamed person screwed up.  Get over it."
       It seems to me that it would be well for the administration to get

       Watergate, so we won't be having those televised hearings.
       The IG investigated based on complaints about the IRS, delays in
       particular.  Their methodology, not their purpose, was an audit of
       a significant number of files to see what criteria were used, how
       they were used and the effect of the screening system on outcomes,
       and if their was a bias or problem.  Further, the report spoke
       directly to issues of training, review, involving upper management
       in processes that may have legal and political implications instead
       of leaving it to field personnel and the first level of management.

       about what the report covers.
       How can the IG reach a conclusion, print it in the report, and
       state that the criteria was set and never reviewed by more than
       first level management initially and that was wrong, if they didn't
       know from looking at the files, memos, etc who set the policy?  If
       you read the footnotes to the report, it never names a person's
       name, but it even names the numbers of people who were on the
       specialist teams (originally one person, there is a lot of your
       delay right there), etc.
       The Administration has done nothing to hinder any investigation.  I
       never said that Congress couldn't investigate.  I merely pointed
       out the widely known disfunctional nature of the House oversight
       under Issa.
       What you keep saying is there has been no investigation, what you
       keep wanting is to further the notion of a need for a witch hunt.
       They are actually different things.
       Anyone can say the administration did something.   The IRS is an
       administrative agency enforcing statutes, so Congress has control
       and oversight of its rule making functions and the power to fund
       the agencies, the executive has the job of administering the
       funding and staffing  of these agencies and making them do their
       work.  It is an interesting hybrid system, but not quite accurate
       to say that Congress has oversight of the 'executive branch' in the
       sense of the President and his functions as assigned by the
       Constitution, as they are separate and co-equal branches under the
       Constitution.
       My point isn't that Congress can't or shouldn't investigate, if the
       IRS made bad rules or even internal criteria, that is clearly in
       the scope of the Congress' control of rulemaking being in line with
       legislative intent.   I am sure the IRS is having to come up with
       even more reports internally to the new acting Director who will be
       expected to report back to the President and probably asked to
       testify before Congress (that will be Congress' call).  You pretend
       none of this will be ongoing.
       All I am saying, is there is very little there, there,  that what
       there was there is pretty much public already, and that this is
       being fanned on this site by some and elsewhere as a political
       scandal to try to pin it on orders from the WH that again, simply

       report was an audit, not an investigation. Every time a member of
       Congress referred to his report as an investigation he corrected
       them and said it was an audit. The IG was very clear that his
       report did not deal with the issues of how the Tea Party
       identification system was established, who knew about it, who
       approved it, and who implemented it. Those are all questions that
       do now need to be answered. I am fully confident that with the
       President's leadership the Executive branch will find the answers
       to those questions and that both the House and Senate
       investigations will find answers to those questions.

 All sorts of people call it an investigation ([546]0+ / 0-)
       [547]http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...
       The methodology was an audit of files, but the purpose of the audit
       was to expressly address the issue brought to the IG from Congress
       related to political targeting: from the introduction of the
       report:

     TIGTA initiated this audit based on concerns  expressed by members
     of Congress. The overall objective of this audit was to determine
     whether allegations were founded that the IRS:  1) targeted specific
     groups applying tax-exempt status, 2) delayed processing of
     targeted groups' applications, and 3) requested  unnecessary
     information from targeted groups

     After media attention, the Director, EO, stopped issuance of
     additional information request letters and provided an extension of
     time to respond to previously issued letters. The Deputy
     Commissioner for Services and Enforcement then asked the Senior
     Technical Advisor to the Acting Commissioner, Tax Exempt and
     Government Entities Division, to find out how applications were
     being processed and make recommendations. The Senior Technical
     Advisor and a team of specialists visited the Determinations Unit in
     Cincinnati, Ohio, and began reviewing cases. As part of this effort,
     EO function Headquarters office employees reviewed the additional
     information request letters prepared by the team of specialists and
     identified seven questions that they deemed unnecessary.
     Subsequently, the EO function instituted the practice that all
     additional information request letters for potential political cases
     be reviewed by the EO function Headquarters office before they are
     sent to organizations seeking tax-exempt status. In addition, EO
     function officials informed us that they decided to destroy all
     donor lists that were sent in for potential political cases that the
     IRS determined it should not have requested. Figure 8 lists the
     seven questions identified as being unnecessary
       A table with dates, who was involved by title and source of
       information, such as emails, is set out.  It is absurd to say no
       one knows what was done by whom when the IG's report spells it out.
       I am not going to quote the whole report, but the information
       wasn't limited to the applications or the contents of the materials
       filed by the applicants. Who did what and when was looked at
       specifically.  That was part of the 'audit'.
       To the extent that the IG called it an audit at the hearing, that
       probably distinguishes it from an investigation into culpability
       where disciplinary action or crimninal charges might be brought as
       opposed to what was done, what should have been done and how to fix
       your process.  But you look at the same facts for any report that
       investigates a process completed by an agency.  Other organizations
       that have looked at the report mention all the things looked at by
       the IG and commented on  as well as his testimony that there were
       no higher ups or political motives.  The lack of high level
       oversight was cited in the report as a problem.

       All I can say to anyone who really wants to know what the IG did,
       is don't listen to the spin here, read the report, there is a lot
       of information in there and it clearly encompasses more background
       work than just pulling open the files of the applications.

       article has a more explicit quote in context of the questioning, I
       linked it.
       And the IG made sure it was an audit as opposed to an
       investigation, on the same distinction I made, culpability of
       individuals versus what is wrong with what happened in the system.

       The very partisan nature of the questioning and types of answers
       that people were trying to elicit is clear in the politifact
       review.
       Again, spin is everything in these 'investigations'.  The IG didn't
       specifically go looking for a link to the White House, but in all
       the documents they did look at, all the emails and reports, etc.,
       they found no trail leading away from low level people.  Again, his
       conclusion, that low level management did some incredibly stupid
       things.   The IG is not going to let himself be drawn in to look
       like he is taking sides.  You are trying to parse this from a very
       winger friendly set of words to make it seem like there is more
       here than what the IG found, reported with great specificity.  The
       only thing missing is the ability to tie it to the WH.   Why that
       is so upsetting and leads you to keep saying, no one knows anything
       just makes you sound like the people on the right who keep
       screaming Benghazi.   What was wrong has been admitted to be wrong.
       It has been changed.   People have lost their jobs over this.
       What is lacking is only the trail to the WH to make it political
       instead of stupid.  There is no there, there.

   "targeting of right wing groups" is not a "scandal" if they were
   blatantly and proudly engaging in political activities from the
   beginning and applying for tax exempt status at the same time.  Why
   shouldn't they be targeted from the beginning when their whole agenda

   with other elected officials who opposed the President and Democrats?

   This "immediate cave" consisted of the President saying "If the IRS

   was wrong.

   What did you expect him to say? "F- the tea party! WOOOO. REPUBLICANS

   It drives me crazy that everything the President does is considered a
   cave regardless of result. Even when we get most of what we want and
   give up nothing, all we hear is that this just shows that president is
   going to cave NEXT TIME.

   See Fiscal cliff, tax cuts expiring, etc etc.

     Second, and more importantly, it's not a "scandal" if the IRS asks
     groups applying for special tax status to verify their eligibility.
     If you want special privileges, you're going to have to be willing
     to substantiate your claims. When the IRS asks a group applying for
     501(c)(4) status to prove that it is entitled to that status, that's

       [686]New CRS briefer:

     Here, the term "exclusively" is not defined in statute, whether in
     the IRC or somewhere else. This may lead some to think the term
     should be given its ordinary and customary definition. The
     dictionary definition of "exclusively" is "only" or "solely," which
     suggests the IRS  interpretation is overly broad.

     However, this is an example of where a term's statutory meaning
     might not be obvious on its face. In a 1945 case, the Supreme Court
     found that a Social Security Act requirement that an organization be
     operated "exclusively" for certain tax-exempt purposes "plainly
     means that the presence of a single [non-exempt] purpose, if
     substantial in nature, will destroy the exemption regardless of the
     number or importance of truly [exempt] purposes." In other words, an
     organization may engage in activities for a non-exempt purpose so
     long as those activities are  insubstantial. The Court found the
     organization did not qualify for the exemption because "an
     important, if not the primary, pursuit" of the group was engaging in
     non-exempt purpose activities.
     This case may provide support for the IRS's interpretation of the
     law to permit 501(c)(4) groups to engage in some campaign activity
     even though the statute says they must be operated "exclusively" for
     social welfare purposes. Additional support might be found in the
     IRC's income tax scheme on 501(c) groups with unrelated business
     income, as it may suggest that Congress recognized 501(c)
     organizations could engage in some activity outside their tax-exempt
     purpose.  Some, while conceding these points, might still argue that
     the IRS nonetheless was wrong to use "primarily" as the standard
     because it may permit more campaign activity than would be allowed
     under a "substantial in nature" test. The basis for this argument is
     that the regulation's use of the term "primarily" may suggest
     campaign activity is permissible so long as it (and any other
     nonexempt purpose activity) is less than 50% of the group's
     activities, while an "insubstantial" standard would seem to permit a
     lesser amount of such activity. In order to assess this argument, it
     seems necessary to have a better understanding of how the IRS
     interprets the regulation in practice....

   the IRS compromised between the two conflicting laws by using primarily
   which seemed to satisfy Congress who never passed another law

   ignoring facts, and repeating scandalized bemoanings from right wing
   groups.

   Too bad the higher ups didn't carbon copy the President so the right
   wing would finally have the scandal they really want.   But that
   doesn't stop the media from repeating statements from the wingers about
   how they are sure there might be a memo somewhere, if they just keep

   This is silly.  First it was a widespread issue involving the President
   and all Conservative groups, then it was the Director of the IRS and
   many Conservative groups, then it was the office supervisor and groups
   with Tea Party in their name.  When this all shakes out it will
   probably be an intern who suggested that the groups screaming about how
   the IRS are criminals should maybe be looked at with more scrutiny.

   Also, as I take everything the IG says with a huge grain of salt.

       Yes, it is often the case that when people -- including lower-level
       processors -- feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work they are
       facing, they take shortcuts.  And it is logical to believe that one
       or more lower-level processors decided on their own to address the
       applications with "tea party" or similar words in the titles.
       One of the things that bugs me is the (arrogant) assumption that
       lower-level employees have no minds of their own and do things
       precisely as they are instructed.  But it could well be that the
       lower-level employees watch television or read the Internet or
       newspapers, draw their own conclusions about which applicants are
       most likely trying to get away with something (i.e., the tea party)
       and sort through and tackle their respective workloads accordingly.

       There is no need to automatically assume that President Obama or
       some senior official instructed the processors to discriminate.
       There is need to understand that people at all levels think
       independently and tend to arrange their work in a way they find
       manageable, regardless of the specific official policies and
       procedural guidelines.

       One employee could have decided that they would use these key words
       to filter applicants for scrutiny.  Federal Employees, especially
       in auditing roles, are given wide autonomy as to who they target.
       If they see a mistake they will often target similar applications.
        There aren't enough resources to target everyone and it would be a
       waste of resources to just randomly choose applicants to target.

   abusers of tax exempt status.

   Several stories have been written describing his practice of raising
   funds through a tax exempt organization and then siphoning them off

 Scrutiny ([816]0+ / 0-)

   is needed, of course. But I have seen little comment here on the
   seriously far-reaching kind of scrutiny demanded by the IRS
   questionnaires that have been circulating. Demands for complete lists
   of members, donors, interactions, minutes of all meetings, copies of
   all web pages, accounts of all discussions, and on, and on, and on...
   And, of course, the little matter that any information supplied will be
   made publicly available. And then, the IRS will get right back to
   you--just a couple of years maybe. This looks more like trying to bury
   these groups in mindless bureaucratic rigamarole than anything that
   might be regarded as simply judicious, even-handed application of the
   (unstated) rules. Yes, this time it's the Tea Party. Next time?

   When the IRS acts in a political manner it definitely is a scandal.
   Which is why the President took swift action on the matter. The initial
   explanation was it just a few rogue agents in Cincinnati. That
   obviously is not the case.

     it's not a "scandal" if the IRS asks groups applying for special tax
     status to verify their eligibility.

   Is IS a scandal if they target certain groups because of their beliefs.

     The problem comes if some groups are treated differently than other
     groups because of their political belief.

   They were. The IRS used inappropriate, political and ideological terms
   to target conservative applications for 505(s) status.

   And exactly who has claimed that groups seeking tax exempt status
   should not be examined?

   I'll stick with the President on this matter, you can try to defend the
