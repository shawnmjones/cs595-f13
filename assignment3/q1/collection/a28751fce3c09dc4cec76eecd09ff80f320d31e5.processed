[24]Holder seeks to restore key Voting Rights Act protections in Texas

   Eric Holder address National Urban League on July 25, 2013
   Eric Holder announces the DOJ action in a speech to National Urban
   League
   Attorney General Eric Holder announced Thursday morning that the
   Department of Justice would seek to "bail in" the state of Texas to the
   preclearance requirements of the Voting Rights Act, citing
   "intentional" and "pervasive" racial discrimination in the state's
   voting laws. Because of that history of discrimination, Holder said,
   "we believe the state of Texas should be subject" to the VRA's
   preclearance provision, which would require the state to seek approval
   from the Federal government before changing any of its voting laws.

   Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the formula used by Congress
   to determine which states and localities should be subject to
   preclearance was unconstitutional, but it left intact the preclearance
   provision itself as well as the mechanism for "bailing in" state and
   local governments on an ad hoc basis.

   After the court's ruling, Texas immediately [30]declared plans to
   impose new voting restrictions that would make it more difficult for
   racial and ethnic minorities to vote. The state's attorney general
   gleefully boasted that Eric Holder "could no longer deny" Texas the
   ability to remake voting rights in the state. With today's news, it
   appears he may have spoken too quickly.

   In his remarks, Holder indicated that the Texas decision was [31]just
   the beginning of a DOJ inititiative to use the bail in provision.

     "This is the department's first action to protect voting rights
     following the Shelby County decision, but it will not be our last,"
     Mr. Holder said. "Even as Congress considers updates to the Voting
     Rights Act in light of the court's ruling, we plan, in the meantime,
     to fully utilize the law's remaining sections to subject states to
     preclearance as necessary. My colleagues and I are determined to use
     every tool at our disposal to stand against such discrimination
     wherever it is found."

   Holder said the DOJ would file its request to bail in Texas in a Texas
   federal court. If successful, Texas would be subject to preclearance
   for the next decade.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [45]Tagging tips - [46]Search For Tags - [47]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       not directed specifically at any one person here, but is Holder
       back in Kos' good graces because of this, or do we still want him
       to resign because he's too tight with Wall Street?
       Pursuing these voter suppression cases won't be any easier if he's
       forced to leave and we have an AG vacancy that will instantly
       result in another circus in the Senate.

       but I'd rather see him stay if it means avoiding another
       confirmation circus.  Obama could appoint a reincarnated John Jay
       and the Republicans would still find the new AG to be a racist,
       communist, corrupt, lying, incompetent tool of Hugo Chávez.

   In other matters he hasn't.

 certainly ([215]0+ / 0-)
       both can be pointed out, but this just reminded me of a FP post not
       too long ago that was demanding Holder's resignation or termination
       because of his alleged lack of aggression towards Wall Street.  I
       happened to agree with some of that, although I don't know who
       would replace him or whether he/she would be as good as Holder wrt
       these voting rights cases.
       At this point I'd prefer if he would stay through 2016, because
       then we'd at least be sure to have an AG that fights against voter
       suppression.

 And the corpocracy ([219]0+ / 0-)
       I think this is all great on Holder's part but the absolute zero
       enforcement from Justice towards Wall Street is inexcusable.  Why
       can't we have both, anyway?  I'd be happier if he resigns soon.

       Holder's action is completely consistent with Court's ruling.  The
       Court may have envisioned Congress acting instead of the DOJ, but
       pre-clearance based on current conditions is exactly what the
       decision required.

       that Roberts' 5 activist-judges were hoping for the VRA to be
       expanded beyond the states previously requiring pre-clearance as a
       result of their decision, but rather, intended to throw up major
       road-blocks for southern minority voters in pre-clear states

       You may be right that they were hoping for VRA protections to just
       collapse.  But they weren't activist enough to throw out the entire
       law.  They may have thrown out the 40 year old maps, but I have a
       current map with 50 states on it, nice and simple.
       They upheld the federal authority so now they can choke on it.  The
       best outcome truly is a massive expansion of VRA protections.

       Why do you think the court will choke on the federal authority it
       uphled?
       If it really hated the authority, it could have found it
       unconstitutional.
       In case you've forgotten, this is the second major VRA act this
       year. An earlier act struck down Arizona's requirement that voters
       show proof of  citizenship.
       And --  guess what? The author of that opinion was none other than
       one Justice Antonin Scalia.

   What's another kick in the onions is that students can't use their

   at these voter suppression tactics but the problem is deeper than that.
    we need to have the federal elections run in a uniform manner and have
   government issued voter i.d.'s.  no state should be allowed to jerryrig
   the process by demanding i.d. that many of its legal voters can not
   get.  if the feds can run the social security department, they can run
   a voter i.d. program based on the same kind of system. as long as the
