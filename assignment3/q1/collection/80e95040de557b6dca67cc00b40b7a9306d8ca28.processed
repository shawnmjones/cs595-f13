Presidents and jobs - a tale of the tape

   With the revised job totals published this morning, we now know that
   2012 was a better year for job creation than previously believed --
   2.17 million jobs were created just last year overall, 2.24 million in
   the private sector. When I [3]noted that 2012 was the best year for
   jobs since 2005, and better than seven of the eight years Bush/Cheney
   was in office, some of you were skeptical. I received a few "that can't
   be right" emails.

   So, let's take a minute to take a closer look. I put together this
   chart this morning, showing annual job totals from the start of
   Bush/Quayle through the end of 2012. Blue represents Democratic
   administrations, while red represents Republican administrations, and
   darker colors represent job creation overall, while lighter colors
   represent job creation in just the private sector.

   What does this tell us? A few things. First, Clinton and Obama outpace
   Bush and Bush in creating new jobs, even though both Democratic
   administrations inherited weaker economies.

   Second, the 2.17 million jobs overall in 2012 really was the best year
   since 2005, and surpass seven of the eight years of Bush/Cheney. While
   2012 obviously wasn't robust for job creation, it managed to surpass
   [DEL: three :DEL] two of the eight years Clinton/Gore was in office,
   too.

   And third, while the private sector has done better than the overall
   economy under Obama, under his three most recent predecessors, the
   opposite was true.

   Yes, it's further proof that if President Obama is a radical socialist,
   he's really bad at implementing the tenets of his leftist ideology.

   Looks to me that every year Bush, Clinton and Bush II were in office,
   government jobs grew (dark bar gains more that light bar gains, dark
   bar losses fewer than light bar lossed) with the possible exception of
   2003, which is so slight it's hard to tell.

   Only under Obama have government jobs been clearly reduced. And that
   for each of his first four years.

   Because Everyone Knows its true! And in our modern media culture what
   Everyone Knows to be true is far more important than what a bunch of
   pedants with a bunch of actual data know to be true based on silly old
   empirical evidence.

   Politico, Halperin and Joe Scarborough exist solely to mock those who
   try to challenge what Everyone Knows with objective data. Halperin's
   role is to dispense and articulate what Everyone Knows so that Everyone
   Who Matters (his "gang of 500) may know what Everyone Knows.
   Scaroborough's role is mock at the most simplistic level, to mock with
   incredulous guffaws the very idea that what Everyone Knows isn't true.
   And Politico's role is to give a cynical and worldly-wise chuckle at
   the pathetic futility of challenging what Everybody Knows even if
   Politico knows what Everyone Knows is wrong.

   The GOP response to steller job creation under democrats and less then
   desirable under Republicans is simple. Democrats enjoy the spoils of
   Republican policy while Republicans suffer under Democrat policy. Of
   course, we'll have to elect another Democrat to see if there's a dip in
   jobs after Obama leaves to be sure it's not just because Republicans
   screw it all up.

   the amazing part of your numbers is they do not take into account jobs
   lost vs jobs gained. Is this important or not?

   Is it? Perhaps you could provide a chart of jobs lost per month from 89
   to 2011? I'd like to see that myself. If you don't have one, it should
   be easy to research, no?

   Just one question - if the numbers are higher under Bush II, is that
   important or not?

   Maybe this will help, charts of percentage of the population that are
   employed. You'll note the accelerating declines. Why? This measure
   can't be numerically manipulated like the unemployment rate.

   Actually, I headed over to:

   [54]http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm

   Where you can grab data and do your own analysis. I'm guessing the
   numbers you're after are seasonally adjusted "Not in Labor Force, Want
   a Job Now". Unfortunately those numbers only go back to 1994. Doubly
   unfortunate, their graphing software makes a common error - the numbers
   range from 4,000 to 7,000 a year, with no zero point. All that said,
   numbers for Obama aren't great so far in terms of unemployment. I urge
   you take a look at the site and do your own analysis - interesting.

   Re: #3.2

   Since you posted that link again, I'll post my response again:

   Thanks for the link. I don't know who "zerohedge" is, but the graphs
   were from FRED - one of my favorite sources for data.

   One of the graphs is this one:

   Civilian Employment - Population Ratio (SA

   [58]http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EMRATIO

   I would like to point out several things:

   One is that the graph in the article stops with January 2011 - and so
   misses the improvement since then.

   The author also makes a point of showing that on 1/1/2009 it was 60.6%.
   As of 1/1/2013 it is 58.6. (Anybody remember what happened to the
   economy in between those two dates?)

   Does this chart look good? H*** No! Are the numbers going up? Yes -
   creeping.

   Another thing I want to point out is that the current % is similar to
   what it was back in the early 80's. As I recall, that was about the
   time wages started to stagnate and it became necessary for the Moms to
   go back to work - thus increasing the % of the population employed. So
   maybe the 60.6% employment is not a target we want to strive for
   (speaking as a Mom who had to work full-time from the time my kids were
   little).

   I believe the chart reflects "net job growth" which factor in "loss
   jobs". Regardless, facts are real and the numbers support the GOP are
   not good economic stewards!

   Wouldn't it have to factor in lost jobs in order to have a negative
   number? I mean you can't create negative jobs. So this would probably
   have to be net job growth.

   2001 was the Dot Com bust as well as 9/11. So blaming Bush probably
   isn't completely justified.

   Bush inherited a surplus. All he would have to do is basically "Don't
   mess up." Instead he decided to go to unfunded wars and give everyone a
   tax cut. Bush blew a surplus and Obama inherited a mess. The two are
   hardly comparable.

   Am I blind? I only see 2 worse years for Clinton. 1995 & 2000.

   Is the reason that public sector jobs did better before Obama; because,
   back then, the Republican Party did not do things to hurt the economy
   on purpose?

   Sure... that explains why EVERY Democrat controlled state is
   financially in the toilet, and EVERY Democrat controlled city is
   unlivable because of the corruption and crime. Still, I suppose to
   Democrats, maybe that IS good government ? Still, what can you expect

   Inheriting a bad economy makes it easier to add jobs than inheriting a
   good economy, cause there are more people to take jobs and more jobs
   recently lost.

   I think the republicans are expert in creating delusions while
   demonizing their opponents ie the "so called liberal media", the
   democrats etc. The MSM buy into their spin to avoid their constant
   media attacks therefore the factual reality is skewed and not realized
   until after the fact....shows they are not fiscally responsible, be it
   jobs, the deficits, equality etc.

   It would be interesting to see the same chart, not from the view of who
   held the White House, but from who controlled Congress. Clinton looks
   better on the economy and job creation after the Republicans take
   control in 1994. Bush, who was a bit of spendthrift anyway, looks far
   worse after 2006, after the Democrats run wild, and the Democratic
   supported real estate bubble bursts. Not all the blame for the crash is
   atributable to the Republicans, nor the booms to the Democrats. Much
   blame to share, but a lot of the malaise is also a Democratic
   construct. After six years of Democratic control, including two years
   of Democrartic super-majorities, with control of the White House, it
   continues. When is it the chosen one's whatch? Just saying.

   I guess you missed Republican President George W Bush's support of the
   real estate bubble during his 2004 re election campaign along with his
   Balance Budget by 2012 promise not to mention Republican President
   Ronald Reagan (Deregulation) appointed Greenspan!
