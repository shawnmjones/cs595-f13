[2]Mitt, Venn And Now

helping out mitt romney, one venn diagram at a time.

   Mitt, Venn And Now

About this blog

   Mitt Romney's campaign team needs your help. Unable to understand Venn
   diagrams, they released a series that are in no way coherent. So we
   [3]started helping them.
   They could probably use your help, too. [4]Send us your ideas and we'll
   get them cranked out so Mitt and his team always have a handy reference
   for the future.
   (Or, you know, you could follow our [5]regular blog. We're pro-choice
   here at Upworthy.)

   We couldn&#8217;t help ourselves. We had to make a diagram to mark this
   story.

   [56]This one comes to you courtesy of the geniuses over at the
