     * Today's [29]comic by Jen Sorensen is [30]Gap's reputation collapse:
     * [31]No summer downtime for auto plants this year:

     The three Detroit carmakers traditionally shut factories for two
     weeks around July 4 to do maintenance and change the machinery for
     new models. But they don't have that luxury this year. U.S. demand
     for new cars and trucks has been strong, up 7 percent through April,
     led by soaring demand for full-size pickup trucks as home
     construction rebounds. And after closing more than two dozen
     factories during the recession, U.S. automakers need to use their
     remaining capacity to its fullest. [...]

     Not all automakers are changing their schedule. Honda and Nissan
     said Tuesday they still plan to close their U.S. plants for a week
     around July 4. Toyota is also planning to shut down its U.S. plants
     for a week this summer.
     * [32]Expelling performance-hurting stereotypes from the classroom:

     Scientific American science writer Ed Yong explores new research on
     stereotype threat--the fear of confirming derogatory stereotypes
     about one's social group. Such anxiety can undermine people's
     performance in school, sports and the workplace. A girl in an
     advanced math class, for example, might worry that she will not test
     as well as the boys, because of the stereotype that boys are better
     at math. Her concerns might distract her and tax her mental
     resources so that she performs below her abilities. Similarly, a
     young white basketball player might play poorly because he is
     worried that he is not as skilled as his African-American peers.
     Stereotype threat is one of the explanations for certain achievement
     gaps.
     * [33]Budget-cutting lay-offs allow woman to be raped: She called 911
       to say her ex-boyfriend who had put her in the hospital a few weeks
       before was trying to break into her house.

     But the dispatcher has no one to send. Because the local sheriff's
     department recently lost millions in federal funds, it laid off 23
     of its 29 deputies and limited their availability to eight hours on
     Mondays through Fridays. The woman's call to 911 took place on a
     Saturday. [...]

     Eventually, the ex-boyfriend, a man named Michael Bellah, pried open
     the woman's front door. Choked her. And raped her. After he was
     caught, he plead[ed] guilty to kidnapping, assault, and sex abuse.
     * [34]Ríos Montt's attorney says the general's genocide trial must
       restart: In Spanish, an attorney is an abogado, but the attorney of
       Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt, Francisco García Gudiel, is often referred
       to in Guatemala as an "abogangster." Now that the country's high
       court has overturned Montt's conviction for genocide for his
       ordering the killing in the early 1980s of more than 1,700 Ixil
       Indians, next steps are being considered.

     [García said:] "You have to cancel the whole process and begin a new
     trial with new judges." [...]

     Back in 1983, Elliott Abrams, the assistant secretary of state for
     human rights under President Ronald Reagan, [35]once suggested that
     General Ríos Montt's rule had "brought considerable progress" on
     human rights.
     * [36]Hanging out at the White House in all his cuteness.
     * [37]Origins of Human Culture Linked to Rapid Climate Change:

     Rapid climate change during the Middle Stone Age, between 80,000 and
     40,000 years ago, during the Middle Stone Age, sparked surges in
     cultural innovation in early modern human populations, according to
     new research. [...]

     "The occurrence of several major Middle Stone Age industries fell
     tightly together with the onset of periods with increased rainfall."
     "Similarly, the disappearance of the industries appears to coincide
     with the transition to drier climatic conditions."
     * [38]Why are the "tone police" so one-sided?:

     Basically, I think the problem is everyone knows that progressives
     are the good guys and reactionaries are the bad guys, and so the
     onus to take the high road is always and forever on progressives.
     The problem, of course, is the "high road" is a constantly shifting
     target. If you refrain from overt jokes about conservatives, the
     next thing you're told is too far is sarcasm. If you cave into the
     intense pressure to stop using terms like "racist" and "sexist"
     accurately, as we've witnessed, even talking about the concept of
     privilege is considered a bridge too far. You begin to realize that
     speaking at all from the position of moral authority as a
     progressive is what is offensive, because you make people feel bad
     for, well, being bad people.
     * [39]Arizona legislator Juan Mendez says he is an atheist during
       invocation:

     A state lawmaker acknowledged that he is an atheist as he gave the
     daily House invocation Tuesday, urging legislators to look at each
     other, rather than bow their heads, and "celebrate our shared
     humanness."

     Rep. Juan Mendez, D-Tempe, who said it was freeing to be open about
     his secular views, also introduced about a dozen fellow members of
     the Secular Coalition for Arizona, who watched from the House
     gallery.

       More GunFAIL & passive voice. A note from alpaca farmer on one of
       the key arguments once made against a Utah bill to mandate alerting
       parents of armed teacher in their kid's classroom. And the guy
       quoted in support of armed teachers, whose argument rested on the
       extra protection of the permitting process, once lobbied to repeal
       the permitting requirement entirely! Plus, he's actually been on my
       GunFAIL list before! Moving on, more facts about tax-exempt
       political groups, and discussion of a possible "nuclear option" on
       filibusters.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [53]Tagging tips - [54]Search For Tags - [55]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     In 1978, he left the Roman Catholic Church and became a minister in
     the California-based evangelical/pentecostal Church of the Word;
     since then Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson have been personal

       This would be abhorrent regardless of any purported "reason", but
       these religiously-motivated attacks risk stoking a larger fire. My
       hopes here are twofold.
       First, obviously, I hope this is an isolated event. For several
       reasons, I believe that it is.
       Second, and especially with this occurring in London at the same
       time the riots and unrest in Sweden are continuing, I hope this
       doesn't snowball into wider violence against or by the British
       Muslim or immigrant communities.

     Atheists should be seen as good people if they do good, Pope Francis
     has said in his latest urging that people of all religions, and
     none, work together.

     The leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics made his
     comments in the homily of his morning mass at his residence, a daily
     event at which he speaks without prepared comments.

     He told the story of a Catholic who asked a priest if even atheists
     had been redeemed by Jesus.

     "Even them, everyone," the pope answered, according to Vatican
     Radio. "We all have the duty to do good," he said.

     "Just do good, and we'll find a meeting point," the pope said in a
     hypothetical reply to the hypothetical comment: "But I don't
     believe. I'm an atheist."

   Last week he essentially said that present-day capitalism is tyranny.

   Welcome to the Kabuki Theater of the Absurd.  Please take your seats
   and get ready for an act that's always a sure crowd pleaser!

   Get ready to cheer as (D) Harry Reid whips out the football and
   promises to let progressives kick it!

   This time Harry's for real.  He's serious about "Filibuster Reform".
   He means it.  No, really.  He does.  All those past times?  Fuggetabout
   it!

   This time.  Filibuster Reform.  It's Real.  It's Here.

   And Progressives, both real and professional, are going to absolutely
   love this recurring act.

   The excuses for Obama's behavior have long since passed the point of
   predictability neccessary to qualify as an absurd production of Kabuki
   Theater.

 Stereotype threat, eh? ([262]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [263]wintergreen8694, [264]JeffW, [265]Sonnet

   That doesn't feel quite right to me. Stereotype excuse/justification
   sounds closer to right.

   Makes me think of an experience with my youngest daughter earlier this
   school year.  She might be the brightest of my kids, and, in this
   unbiased father's opinion, that's saying a lot.

   She is in a special gifted magnet program designed to challenge (even
   threaten) her academically.

   One very good but scary feature of the program is that the school
   system, using a combination of teacher recommendations and test scores,
   will invite children to join that have not previously been identified
   and placed into accelerated classes.

   The "how did we manage to miss you before" kids have more of a struggle
   with the material at first because they are not used to working at that
   level.  The teachers are aware of the problem and do a fantastic job of
   pulling every kid along who is willing to lean in and do the work.

   At one point, she was getting her butt whipped by math and told me,
   "I'm not like you, dad. I'm not smart in math."

   I reminded her that my kids are not allowed to say or think they're not
   smart, and then we went about figuring out the problem, talking with
   teachers, and moving forward.

   She's all A's now, but I have to wonder:

   If my very smart girl, my girl who has been singled out by the school
   system and placed in a special magnet school for the gifted, my lgirl
   who has the advantage of teachers who know how to prod her into doing
   her very best, my girl whose self esteem is, well, estimable...if my
   girl can feel like that, what about other very smart girls who haven't
   been singled out and who haven't been given all that support?  When
   math kicks their butts, what happens?

   Do they say, "I'm just not smart at math.  Doesn't matter, anyway.  I'm
   a girl"?

   Conservatives love to wail about liberal "political correctness."
   Heck, Anders Breivik killed about 80 people because he hated political
   correctness.

   But conservative have their own all encompassing PC that includes
   speech, media, art and well just about everything else. It's called
   religion, and if anything you do or say does not match their standards
   of religious PC, they will pitch an absolute fit and claim they are

 The rape case argues for gun ownership ([343]1+ / 0-)

          [344]Meteor Blades

   I don't like it either, but case after case shows that one cannot
   blindly trust the police to come rushing to everyone's rescue.  Even
   with proper funding, the police can't be everywhere.  They cannot
   prevent crime, they can only clean up afterwards.

   So what is a woman to do, alone in her house, while a man is breaking
   in to rape and kill her?  Just sit there and wait for it?

   Now I personally have a baseball bat and if something like this
   happened to me or my wife, I have every intention of going down
   swinging.  But even with a weapon like a bat, many women are not a
   physical match for an enraged male.

   Events like this rape are why I will always support the right of an
   individual to decide for themselves if they should own a gun or not.

 An "abogado" is a Spanish lawyer ([364]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [365]Meteor Blades

   Which reminded me that "avocat" is the French word for "lawyer."
   They're both related to the English word "advocate." Makes sense,
   right? B and V are related (P, F, B, and V, actually) and C (K sound)
   and G are related (K, G, CH and J). Voiced, voiceless. Labial, dental,
   fricative, and so on.

   But in French, "avocat" also means "avocado." The words for lawyer and
   avocado are the same. I think one is masculine and the other is
   feminine.

   But I think it's funny. And worth mentioning.
