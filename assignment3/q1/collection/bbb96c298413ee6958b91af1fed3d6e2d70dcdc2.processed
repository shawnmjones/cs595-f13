   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * This is China's fifth crewed space mission and is scheduled to last
       15 days
     * It is the first high-profile launch since Xi Jinping became
       president in March
     * The mission seeks to test technology related to constructing a
       space station
     * China's march into space underscores its growing financial and
       military clout

   Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Chinese spaceship blasted off Tuesday from a
   launch center in the Gobi Desert, carrying three astronauts on what is
   expected to be the Asian giant's longest crewed mission yet.

   Propelled by a Long March-2F rocket, the Shenzhou 10 craft is scheduled
   to dock with the Tiangong-1 space module where the crew will transfer
   supplies to the space lab, which has been in orbit since September
   2011.

   China has stepped up the pace of its space program since first sending
   astronaut Yang Liwei into orbit in 2003. In 2012, it conducted 18 space
   launches, according to the Pentagon.

   Tuesday's launch from the the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center marks the
   start of China's fifth crewed space mission.

   Footage broadcast by state broadcaster CCTV showed the craft lift off
   from the Gobi's flat expanse and arrow into the empty blue sky.
   Officials at the launch center looked on as it gained altitude,
   gradually shedding stages of the rocket.

   During its 15 days in orbit, the crew will master the rendezvous and
   docking capabilities that are essential for the operation of a manned
   space platform.

   "The functionality, performance, and coordination of all systems will
   be evaluated during this mission," Wu Ping, a spokesperson for China's
   Manned Space Program, told a news conference on Monday ahead of the
   launch.

   She added that another main objective of the mission was to test
   technologies related to the construction of a space station as China
   seeks to establish a long-term human presence in space.

   The most recent crewed mission last year carried its first female
   astronaut and was the first to make a manual docking with the space
   module. The crew for this mission will also include a woman, Wang
   Yaping, and two male astronauts, Nie Haisheng and Zhang Xiaoguang.

   "These longer duration missions and space dockings are essential
   practice for any kind of long-term, more permanent presence in space or
   a mission to, say, the moon," said Dean Cheng, a research fellow at the
   Washington-based Heritage Foundation.

   Growing power

   China's march into space underscores the country's growing financial
   and military clout and has unsettled some Western observers.

   A 92-page report on Chinese military development released by the
   Pentagon last month highlighted the advances in China's space
   capabilities.

   "China is developing a multi-dimensional program to improve its
   capabilities to limit or prevent the use of space-based assets by
   adversaries during times of crisis or conflict," the report said.

   A spokeswoman for China's manned space missions said last year the
   program would cost a total of almost 40 billion yuan (US$6.27 billion).

   The U.S. closed its space shuttle program in 2011 and is no longer
   aggressively pursuing manned space exploration, leaving Russia and
   China as the only two countries in the world capable of independently
   sending humans into space.

   "In some ways, they have overtaken the US, at least temporarily," says
   the Heritage Foundation's Cheng. "Of course, the US, and even more
   Russia, have more experience in manned space. China is not, at this
   time, capable of reaching the Moon."

   "But like the tortoise and the hare, China is slowly catching up with
   the US."

   However, Cheng says that China is not engaged in a space race with the
   US. Rather: "They have a long-term plan, and they are sticking to it."

   Private space ambitions

   Companies like Boeing, Space X and Virgin Galactic are scrambling to
   develop private sector spacecraft and operate in what has previously
   been the exclusive preserve of sovereign nations.

   China is not part of the project that maintains the International Space
   Station (ISS), which currently orbits the Earth conducting experiments
   in a range of fields, from physics to astronomy.

   The ISS is a joint venture between NASA, Russia's RKA space agency,
   Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency, the European Space Agency and the
   Canadian CSA.

   China views its multi-billion dollar space program as a way to raise
   prestige both domestically and abroad. This is the first high-profile
   space launch since new leader Xi Jinping assumed the presidency in
   March.

   Public reaction to the planned mission was mixed, with some users of
   the Twitter-like Weibo platform wishing the astronauts well, while
   others said the resources were best used on the ground.

   "Our country may be lagging behind in other areas, but China has great
   achievement in aerospace technology," said one user with the handle
   @Jiniaobieliulin.

   "The government should spend more money to help those of lowest social
   status," said another user identified as @Xiaoxiaojuna.

   Journalist Katie Hunt wrote and reported from Hong Kong, and CNN's
   Zhang Dayu reported from Beijing. CNN's Jethro Mullen in Hong Kong
   contributed to this report.
