[22]House debt limit vote coming tomorrow

   House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, and Majority
   Leader Eric Cantor stand in front of a white flag of surrender
   House Republican leadership is already flying the white flag of
   surrender.
   The question now is whether they have the votes to surrender in unison.
   If you want to bury something in the news, announcing it in the middle
   of a presidential inauguration seems like a pretty good way to go, and
   that's exactly what House Republicans did yesterday when they offered
   details on exactly how they plan to conduct their [29]debt limit
   surrender on the floor of the House sometime [30]tomorrow:

     Republican leaders in the House of Representatives said they aim to
     pass on Wednesday a nearly four-month extension of the U.S. debt
     limit, to May 19.

     The measure does not specify a new dollar amount but allows the
     government to borrow what is needed to meet its obligations during
     the extension period, according to legislative language released on
     Monday. [...]

     Under the proposed legislation, if either the House or Senate fails
     to meet the April 15 budget deadline, lawmakers' pay would be
     withheld under the measure until their chamber passes a budget. If
     none is passed, they would eventually get paid, but not until next
     January 15.

   This is pretty much what Republicans announced on Friday, but the "no
   pay" provision is even sillier. Instead of "no budget, no pay" it's "no
   budget, delayed pay." That's really a side note, however--Senate
   Democrats [31]are already saying they'll produce a budget and the law
   already requires them to pass one. Including a demand for one in the
   debt ceiling bill is stupid, but it's more like insisting on a talking
   point than anything else. In any meaningful sense, Republicans are
   [32]waving a white flag here.

   The question now is whether House Republicans can pull together enough
   votes to pass their surrender--or if we're about to see a replay of
   House Speaker John Boehner's Plan B debacle. One big difference is that
   if the measure were to pass the House and the Senate, the
   administration says the president [33]would sign it. Plan B, on the
   other hand, was never even going to get a vote in the Senate.

   Given that this legislation isn't dead on arrival, Republicans may be
   more willing to vote for it. The conservative Club for Growth has
   already come and [34]said they won't oppose it unlike with Plan B.
   Nonetheless, Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) [35]says he'll vote no and Rep.
   Justin Amash (R-MI) says he's [36]leaning no. Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul
   (R-KY) is applying pressure from the right, [37]accusing House
   Republicans--correctly--of caving.

   Boehner can lose 16 Republican votes before he'd need Democratic
   support to pass the bill, but as the first major legislative action
   after back-to-back violations of the Hastert Rule, he'll probably do
   everything he can to make sure he doesn't need any Democratic votes. If
   he does end up needing them, there's no telling what will happen,
   because Democrats have no incentive to go out of their way to help the
   GOP enact its weird (but ultimately meaningless) "delayed pay" gambit.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health

   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       will go ahead and vote for the three month extension. Mainly
       because they went home to their districts after the tax increase
       and didn't get any mass protests. So, they're probably feeling like
       they can keep the corporate community happy on this one without
       earning themselves a challenger who will get some money.
       And that will break the back of this "default" nonsense the way it
       should have been done in 2011.

     a clean bill to raise the debt ceiling will get signed at this

     Obama said he was happy to talk to Republicans about ways to reduce
     the deficit. "What I will not do," he said, "is to have that
     negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people"

     "Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending," he
     said. "These are bills that have already been racked up."

   ...but it's not a clean bill and it's only for three months, and the

   This isn't a surrender, it's them surviving to fight another day.   In
   four months the re-election afterglow will be gone, as will the mandate
   which usually lasts about 6 months.  They're hoping by that time
   they'll have had enough time and help from the MSM to reframe the
   debate back on out of control spending and debt/deficit issues of 2011
   rather than the occupy-inspired focus on the wealth disparity of 2012.

   The timing, right after tax season is not a mistake either.

       and I suspect by then the President would have gotten through the
       bulk of his major nomination fights.  Then I suspect the budget
       fight will begin in earnest and that's compressed period of about
       two months right on through tax season (which for most of Obama's
       base is a good time of year). So he will have some room to maneuvre
       around them.
       Now that we can stop all this "one on one behind the scenes
       negotiations" crap and get back to normal lawmaking, maybe the
       President can get the better of them as he did here.

   Recommended by:
          [178]shoeless, [179]blue aardvark, [180]Sacto Joe

   All they've done is kick the can another three months until they can
   exploit the upcoming FY '13 CR renewal and the sequester to force the
   budget cuts they want....and the "no budget, no pay" provision is to
   force the Senate to pass the Ryan budget out of the House, which would
   lock in the cuts they want.

   I still think that ultimately, we will see a major cave-in by the
   Democrats, in which a combination of the Simpson-Bowles cuts to Social
   Security/Medicare/Medicaid, some modest tax increases, and a tradeoff
   of some defense spending cuts for even deeper social cuts, is bartered
   for a full year's increase/suspension of the debt ceiling.

   The only fly in the ointment would be whether enough TeaPubs are angry
   enough at the GOP's walkback on default to revolt...and whether any
   Progressives in Congress have even the slightest will of commitment to
   defend social spending.

   Otherwise....don't clink those champagne glasses yet.

       I think this may be a shifting point in American politics; one
       scholars look back on decades form now as a fundamentla transition
       in the legislative process.
       The salary thing is a red herring. The real story is that
       congressional Republians have given up on the Hassert Rule and now
       appear ready to allow Democrats and moderate Republicans to draft
       the budget. That's a big deal.
       If I'm reading this correctly, it's almost as if we've encountered
       the first formal acknowledgment that we're living in a center-left
       country. Republicans are done threatening the crash of the economy
       and have developed a mechanism through which they can allow
       Democrats to control the legislative process, eventhough they are
       actually the majority party in the House.

 Republicans have a problem. ([194]0+ / 0-)
       Many of the Republican reps from uber-red districts are in a tight
       spot. Their consitituencies elected them to kill the federal
       government. They feel like they can't vote for any compromise
       measures or they will be primaried. The thing is, even these
       politicians recognize that the times call for a robust federal
       government and that crashing the economy is not a viable option.
       Never mind the fact that they are inherently at a weaker position
       because this house is a product of geremandering and not
       popularity.
       So what do they do? Cede the legislative process to the Democrats
       so they can pass the legislation needed to keep the country
       running. They're still free to vote against everything to their
       heart's desire -- they're votes just don't really matter. We saw
       this exact thing in the financial cliff negotiations, where the
       ultimate resolution was dictated by the democrats in the House and
       Senate.
       Redstate Republican reps live to fight another day because they can
       point to their voting records against any primary challenge. The
       economy doesn't get it's legs chopped off.
       Win, win, win. This looks like the new norm, right? What am I
       missing.

 Why did we give up so much in the financial cliff ([198]0+ / 0-)
       negotiations if we had all the cards?  That's my issue...we have
       all the cards and are "running the show" and yet give up so much.
       We were told it would never go above $250,000 and yet it did.
       Hell, SS was even put on the table by our side...Thank God it went
       no further than that.  However, the point is that our side made the
       offer and had zero reason to do so.
        So I just don't see how kicking the can a few months will an
       ultimatum to budget or we won't raise it again as a fold on their
       part. Not when we have a history of doing basically giving them
       most of what they ask for, even if we have the mandate and they

 That's fine, but it's just an opinion. ([202]0+ / 0-)

   There's no proof that they have given up the Hassert Rule. Quite the
   contrary. They're excluding Dems fom this vote! Do you honestly think
   House Dems wil or shouldl vote to support the bill as is, with the
   inclusion of that "or else" rider?

   Until I see the Bonehead sitting down to deal with the Minority Leader,
   the Hassert Rule isn't dead. And the Senate should refuse to pass
   anything that doesen't include a substantial number of Democratic House
   votes. They need to back Nancy's play.

       deal, and gave up all his leverage for the debt ceiling and caved?
       Remember how Obama raised taxes on those making over $400k, cut

   ...also, too, the idea was that he was giving up his leverage to avoid
   Chained CPI for SS. That was the outrage. But since the "deal" he's
   come out and spoken in favor on Chained CPI anyway. So has Pelosi. So
   now we're in a situation where the leverage was given up, then we all
   jumped for joy for a three month delay because Jed told us to, and
   we'll probably get Chained CPI anyway. Amnesia, indeed.

   Or do you think that, in spite of President Obama speaking out in favor
   of it, Chained CPI won't happen?

       The  Senate is not obligated by any means to put up a budget or to
       even vote on the House version. The "budget" is simply a template
       guide to funding goverment services; the actual funding is

       wishes, continuing resolution/omnibus spending legislation).

   Adopting a budget is not optional. It is required by law. Under the

   Budget Committee by April 1 of every year and adopt a budget resolution
   on the floor by April 15.

 "No pay" unconstitutional, "Delayed pay" unclear ([383]0+ / 0-)

   Refusing to pay Senators (or Representatives) is unconstitutional.  The
   27th Amendment has very clear language in its one succinct sentence,
   possibly because it was written in 1789: "No law, varying the
   compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives,
   shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have
   intervened."

   It's not clear to me how the courts would interpret the question of
   whether a delay in payment would qualify as "varying the compensation".

   I feel like I'm watching a ball game where one team is running out the
   clock. The GOP has turned the budget into a perpetual crisis that is
   never resolved for more than a few weeks or months at a time. This does
   some great things for the GOP: 1) It keeps their issue at the top of
   the agenda, so we all have to talk about and react to it, which also to
   some extent legitimizes it. 2) Everyone is preoccupied making sure the
   nuts in the GOP don't blow up the economy - which makes it hard to
   accomplish much of anything else.

   Basically, every day the GOP can create chaos and dysfunction is one
   day Pres. Obama and Democrats in Congress can't effectively legislate
   and run the government. The GOP's operational logic is "We had to
   destroy it in order to save it."
