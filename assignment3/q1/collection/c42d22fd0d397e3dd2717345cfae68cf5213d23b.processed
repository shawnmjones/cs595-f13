The political significance of HPV rates

   Associated Press

   Ordinarily, the efficacy of a vaccine and a drop in cancer rates
   wouldn't be part of a political discussion, but [3]HPV has always been
   a little different.

     Infections with the human papillomavirus tied to cervical cancer
     fell by more than half in U.S. teen girls after the HPV vaccine was
     introduced in 2006, despite high-profile controversy -- and low
     rates of uptake, a new study shows.

     Government health officials said Wednesday that the new data should
     encourage wider acceptance of the vaccine, which became a lightning
     rod for political controversy almost from the moment it was
     implemented.

   For those looking for [4]a refresher, the human papillomavirus
   increases a woman's chances of developing cervical cancer. For several
   years, there's been an FDA-approved vaccine available that immunizes
   against HPV infection, but as the Republican Party has become more
   radicalized, the vaccine has been caught up in a culture war -- many
   conservatives believe the vaccine encourages minors to have sex, and if
   they do have sex, they apparently should be punished with cancer.

   The politics surrounding the HPV vaccine took a turn towards the
   ridiculous in 2011, when Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), at the time
   an almost-credible presidential candidate, went after Texas Gov. Rick
   Perry (R) for giving the vaccine to girls in his state. The right-wing
   lawmaker claimed that the HPV vaccine can lead to mental retardation --
   a claim with no foundation in reality -- and Perry ended up apologizing
   for one of his only progressive acts in office.

   It became a hot-button issue again last year when South Carolina Gov.
   Nikki Haley (R) [5]vetoed an HPV bill approved by state lawmaker in her
   own party, despite pleas from state health officials. (South Carolina
   ranks ninth nationwide for cervical cancer deaths. This, alas, did not
   sway the governor.)

   As is often the case, science keeps getting in the way of far-right
   Republican talking points. Last fall, research helped document the fact
   that the HPV vaccine [6]did not change sexual behavior among minors,
   and this week, new data published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases
   helps document the extent to which the vaccine is literally a
   life-saver.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This new information should, if reality means anything at all, have a
   real-world impact on the debate.

     Even now, only about a third of U.S. teen girls ages 13 to 17 have
     had the full series of shots that prevent HPV infection, despite
     repeated studies that show the vaccine is safe and effective, said
     Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and
     Prevention. Other countries, including places such as Rwanda, have
     higher HPV vaccination rates than the U.S., he added.

     "The report should be a wake-up call to our nation to protect the
     next generation by increasing HPV vaccination rates," said Frieden.
     "These are striking results because we can protect the next
     generation of adolescents and girls against cancer."

   All it takes the political will to ignore hysterical right-wing
   arguments.

   GILBERT GOTTFIRED made a really funny joke on joan rivers friday night
   show- "fashion police"- E! network- it was about michael douglas
   admission that his throat cancer was caused from "oral sex" - to women,
   and then said something about Catherine Zeata jones in the same
   sentence.. gilbert didnt say exactly "I ate a Zeta Pie", but i suppose
   that would be the follow up punchline.

   theres also a screaming funny and crude joke on youtube by gilbert
   gottfried about the circus act; and stand up comic standard- " the
   ARISTOCRATS"- OF WHICH THE FINAL PUNCH LINE on that one SHOULD BE- were
   a republican tea party act- were called THE ARISTOCRATS( well not
   exactly, but if the shoe fits..)

   sam kinison- how to well...- "eat a zeta pie"- lick the alphabet. A..
   BBB. CCC. DDD. and lots of "TTTTTTTTT"!!

   as in teehee!!

   but seriously- HPV is nothing to laugh about, and is a serious medical
   issue, as bad or worse than herpes, or HIV, and just as contagious STD.

   are you frightened to have sex yet? no? how about a side order of
   Hepatitis? ABC..

   think ill go find some internet porn- at least thats safe sex..

   Since the vaccine program is a government program that is apparently
   working, Republicans are against it. If the vaccine actually increased
   the likelihood of cancer, they would be pushing to have the program
   expanded (see: Department of Defense, Abrams Tank).

   When Running in the Iowa primary Michell Bachmann said a woman told her
   that her daughter recieved the HPV vaccine and it made her ( dont like

   that woman was her mother.

   To some, "retarded" is code for "not voting Republican". Could be the
   vaccine had nothing to do with it, and the daughter simply looked at
   her parents and said "I don't think so", and chose a different path.

   investigated, and there was no woman on that day who spoke to her about
   vaccines. Michelle was simply projecting her hearfelt wish that anyone
   who has sex will be struck down (by god, of course) with a horrible

   What amazes me is that they can make the argument that a somewhat

   any effect on the behavior of minors without getting laughed out of

     Infections with the human papillomavirus tied to cervical cancer
     fell by more than half in U.S. teen girls after the HPV vaccine was
     introduced in 2006...

     last year when South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) [72]vetoed an HPV

   So, can "50% of infections with the human papillomavirus tied to
   cervical cancer" in South Carolina be laid at Nikki Haley's feet? We

   The discovery that HPV causes most cervical cancers has changed the
   nature of pap testing--what used to be an examination every year is now
   every 3 years, and they mainly check for antibodies to HPV.

   The vaccine is currently recommended to girls who are still virgins;
   but, if a woman has had all negative pap smears, why can't she protect
   herself with the vaccine as well?

   Also, the Michael Douglas case shows that men and boys need to be
   protected, too!

   At this point in time HPV vaccination is most effective during
   childhood or adolescence, but adults can also benefit from the HPV
   vaccine. So yes if you have a clean bill of health (ie no anitbodies to
   HPV) and are under the age of 26 you can still get vacinated. The HPV
   vaccine's safety and effectiveness have not yet been studied in adults
   older than age 26. Until that information is available, the HPV vaccine
   is not recommended for adults older than 26. I'm assuming that they are
   doing these studies now and it it shows to be effective they will then
   recommend it.

   CDC recommends innoculations for both females and males up to the age
   of 21. Gardasil is approved for use in men and boys 9 through 26 years
   of age while, I think, girls and women can use both Gardasil or
   Cervarix.

   Although, to be fair, there was and still is controvesy over making
   this HPV vaccine mandatory and forcing children to get it. Not everyone
   wants to be vaccinated, against HPV or against anything.

   Those people are Typhoid Marys in the offing. Vaccination is safe,
   inexpensive and effective. The only disease to be eradicated from this
   world was done in by teams from the WHO and CDC who jumped on every
   outbreak like a medical special forces team. Now, the vaccine for
   smallpox is a footnote in history.

   If you don't like the idea of vaccination, do your
   (great?)grandchildren a favor, get your children vaccinated. I was
   vaccinated against smallpox, my nieces and nephews weren't.

   The real test will come when time tells us whether there is a
   subsequent reduction in Cervical Cancer diagnoses specific to
   HPV-vaccinated girls and women over their lifetime. Let's not forget
   HPV is still only 'associated' with cervical cancer and the mechanism
   by which is may course cervical cancer remains a focus of much research
   and is an as-yet-unanswered question. A reduction in HPV diagnoses is
   one thing, a reduction in predicted cancers would be much more
   significant and meaningful result.

   Don't worry. The Republicans may not give two hoots about women's
   health, but this affects men's health, too. Just as HPV is associated
   with a rise in cervical cancer in women, it is also associated in an
   increase in throat cancer in men as a result of oral sex. As soon as
   the Republicans realize that HPV in women is causing a serious heath
   threat in men as well, the HPV vaccine will be mandated as often as
   vaginal probes, and the religious right will incorporate it as a
   sacrament for all women.

   [113]And penile cancer.

     HPV infection is found in about half of all penile cancers.
     Researchers believe that infection with HPV is an important risk
     factor for penile cancer. HPV infection is also linked to many other
     cancers, including cancers of the cervix, vagina, and vulva in women
     and cancers of the anus in men and women. It is also a factor in
     some throat cancers (in men and women).

   oral HPV is on the rise and accounting for most oral cancer today. HPV
   can be transfered via kissing so young kids dont have to have sex to
   get infected with it. Why would ANYONE not vaccinate their child (best
   time is before age 12) and prevent them from getting cancer later in
   life now remember that individual may not be exposed to HPV till they
   are an adult

   I generally find the terms "Sexually Transmitted Diseases/Infections"
   to be incredibly dubious to begin with. Pretty much every disease that
   is "transmitted sexually" can be transmitted by other means, but for
   some reason we MUST associate them with sex? We end up making
   assumptions (which is terrible in and of itself) about people who have
   HIV because of blood transfusions, who those who got herpes and hpv
   from skin contact, or those who got crabs from dirty bath towels.

   You know one of the easiest way to get the flu? Having sex with someone
   who has the flu.

   The conservatives are wrong, of course. But its also true that the HPV
   vaccines are dangerous and are responsible for a large number of severe
   adverse events (e.g. neurological damage). The HPV vaccines have NOT
   been shown to the worth the risk. Cervical cancer is treatable, and
   occurs decades after infection (or after the vaccine). The vaccine
   proponents have not made the case that the vaccine is worth the risk.

   The HPV vaccine recommendation is being questioned in japan, for
   example:
