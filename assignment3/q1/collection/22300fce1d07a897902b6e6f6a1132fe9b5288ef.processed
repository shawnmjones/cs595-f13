   [30]Kate Taylor looks at what women think about male politicians
   behaving badly.

     Are women actually outraged about the Weiner and Spitzer
     candidacies? In interviews, some New York women said they would not
     consider voting for the men because of their conduct, but others
     said they were more concerned about the men's politics than their
     behavior.

     Polling data thus far suggests that there may be a gender gap in
     perception of the two men, at least among Democrats. A Wall Street
     Journal/NBC New York/Marist poll released June 26 found that, among
     registered Democrats, 62 percent of men had a favorable opinion of
     Mr. Weiner, compared with 45 percent of women. And last week,
     another poll found that slightly more men (49 percent) than women
     (43 percent) viewed Mr. Spitzer favorably.

     But political analysts say New York this year will provide an
     unusual test of how women feel about misbehaving male politicians,
     because there are other alternatives who are equally liberal, if not
     more so, on social issues. Women are expected to make up a
     significant majority of the Democratic primary electorate -- close
     to 60 percent -- and their choices will shape the outcome.

   How about we poll about the behavior of male politicians that's even
   more objectionable. Say those that are attacking civil rights, the
   right to privacy, and the ability of women to make their way in the
   workplace? I know that's not as fun as talking about penis pics, but...

   Come on inside, let's see what else is up on the editorial pages.

   [31]Ross Douthat on the Republican slough of despond surrounding
   immigration, which is totally the Democrat's fault.

     ...as the Democrats have come to march in lock step on the issue
     --dropping the old union-populist skepticism of low-wage immigration
     in favor of liberal cosmopolitanism and Hispanic interest-group
     pandering -- many of the country's varying, conflicting opinions
     have ended up crowded inside the Republican Party's tent.

     So there are Republicans who would happily vote for the Senate bill
     as is, no questions asked, and Republicans who might never vote for
     a bill that contains the words "comprehensive" and "reform," let
     alone "immigration."

   See, Democrats have become all close-minded in favor of being
   open-minded, which has forced Republicans to display diversity in their
   fight against... diversity. Douthat then explains the clever solution
   that Republicans have: creating a permanent underclass with fewer
   rights and no prospect of ever becoming a full citizen.

     ...the House would find a way to go along with a version of amnesty
     that either didn't include the promise of citizenship or made the
     path so long and arduous that few immigrants would take it.

   Just think of it as the Republican Dream Act  -- cheap labor, no
   rights.

   [32]Clifton Leaf covers an idea that may deflate most of the headlines
   around medical breakthroughs that you've heard since... forever.

     ... even after some 400 completed clinical trials in various
     cancers, it's not clear why Avastin works (or doesn't work) in any
     single patient. "Despite looking at hundreds of potential predictive
     biomarkers, we do not currently have a way to predict who is most
     likely to respond to Avastin and who is not," says a spokesperson
     for Genentech, a division of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche,
     which makes the drug.

     That we could be this uncertain about any medicine with $6 billion
     in annual global sales -- and after 16 years of human trials
     involving tens of thousands of patients -- is remarkable in itself.
     And yet this is the norm, not the exception. We are just as confused
     about a host of other long-tested therapies: neuroprotective drugs
     for stroke, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for anemia, the
     antiviral drug Tamiflu -- and, as recent headlines have shown,
     rosiglitazone (Avandia) for diabetes, a controversy that has now
     embroiled a related class of molecules. Which brings us to perhaps a
     more fundamental question, one that few people really want to ask:
     do clinical trials even work? Or are the diseases of individuals so
     particular that testing experimental medicines in broad groups is
     doomed to create more frustration than knowledge?

   Having been through a family health crisis (ongoing) where studies,
   drugs, and statistics have been advanced with the regularity of machine
   gun fire, Leaf's presentation is both frightening... and all too
   fitting with the confusing swamp of options and outcomes we've been
   living with.

   [33]David Leonhardt revisits the abortion debate to look at why there
   still is an abortion debate.

     It's no secret that the Republican Party differs with public opinion
     on some of the day's biggest issues. Be it on gun control,
     immigration, same-sex marriage or high-end taxes, the party has
     advocated a position at odds with the beliefs of most Americans,
     polls show. This disconnect has helped Democrats win the popular
     vote in five of the last six presidential elections.

     The recent acrimony in the Texas Legislature, with Republicans
     pushing a restrictive abortion bill, seems to provide a new example.
     It has allowed Democrats to cast Republicans, once again, as out of
     the mainstream.

     Yet abortion is not quite like those other issues.

     On abortion rights, both parties have a claim on public opinion.
     Maybe more to the point, both can make a strong case that the other
     party has an extreme view. Abortion is the relatively rare issue in
     which the cliché is true: public opinion does actually rest about
     midway between the parties' platforms.

   I've maintained for years that people would very soon look back on the
   question of gay rights with the same "of course, how could people have
   ever thought otherwise" attitudes that most now hold about issues of
   race and gender.  But in 2020, there will still be an abortion debate.
   And in 2050. Sorry.

   [34]The New York Times looks at executive pay vs. executive value.

     The median compensation of chief executives at 200 of the nation's
     biggest public companies came in at $15.1 million last year, a 16
     percent jump from 2011, according to Equilar, the executive
     compensation analysis firm. The pay packages -- including salary,
     bonus, benefits, stock and option grants -- ranged from $96.2
     million at Oracle to $11.1 million at General Motors.

     Is that excessive? One way to answer that question would be to look
     at the pay gap, the ratio of the pay of the chief executive to that
     of the company's employees. But nobody really knows what the gaps
     are. Three years after passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform
     law requiring companies to disclose the gaps, the Securities and
     Exchange Commission has not even proposed rules to put the provision
     into effect. Nor has Congress or the administration pressed the
     agency to get on with the job.

     ...

     But corporations don't want any of that. To hear them tell it,
     computing the pay gap is too hard. Nonsense. The real obstacle is
     that many chief executives do not want to have to defend what are
     sure to be some indefensibly large gaps.

   By too hard, they mean "too embarrassing." But seeing that we've
   watched these bozos take the world to the brink then turned around and
   given them a raise for it, companies are probably just worrying too
   much. They should print the CEO's salary along with the letters F.U. on
   every employee's paycheck, just for reference. It wouldn't make any
   difference.

   [35]Kathleen Parker on the "principled martyrs" in the GOP House.

     At this stage in the second term of the president they couldn't
     defeat, Republicans seem more like stubborn children refusing to
     come out of their rooms for supper, even though the alternative is
     going to bed hungry.

     This simile is unavoidable in light of the House's passage of a farm
     bill without any provision for food stamps -- the first in 40 years.
     The move prompted fantastic outrage from Democrats, notably Rep.
     Corrine Brown (Fla.), who shrieked: "Mitt Romney was right: You all
     do not care about the 47 percent. Shame on you!" ...

     Was this really the right fight at the right time?

     The wrong time would be in the midst of the politically
     life-altering debate on immigration reform. Again, congressional
     Republicans want to parse reform in pieces, excluding the 11 million
     or so immigrants here illegally, instead of dealing with reform
     comprehensively, as the Senate has done -- and as most Americans
     think necessary.

   Don't worry, Kathleen. Once the GOP creates the permanent non-citizen
   laborer class, they can let the 47% starve.

   [36]Dana Milbank has another look at the GOP's hatred for feeding
   American children.

     Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), a committee chairman and the man who
     led House Republicans to their majority in 2010, was explaining why
     he and his colleagues decided to drop the food stamp program from
     the farm bill.

     "What we have carefully done is exclude some extraneous pieces," he
     said.

     Extraneous? For almost 50 years, food stamps have been part of the
     annual farm bill, and the $80 billion spent on the program keeps
     tens of millions of Americans, about half of them children, from
     going hungry.

     ...as a political matter, the food stamp folly shows just what a
     difficult situation Republican leaders find themselves in. For the
     second time in two days, they had been forced to placate
     conservatives in their own ranks by taking a position that alienates
     crucial segments of the electorate.

   Yes, being stuck between selfish old bastards on one hand and insanely
   selfish old bastards on the other hand is tough. I suppose the GOP
   could do something radical like stop trying to appeal to the worst in
   human nature, but then it wouldn't be the GOP.

   [37]Carl Hiaasen waves to poor Marco Rubio

     As the prospects for comprehensive immigration reform sink, so goes
     his hopes of establishing himself as the solid Republican
     front-runner in the 2016 campaign for the White House.

     Meanwhile, the junior Florida senator is under siege from the
     bug-eyed right wing of his own party. Glenn Beck called him a "piece
     of garbage" and even the tea party has turned on him. It's gotten so
     bad that GOP action groups are putting out commercials saying nice
     things about Rubio, just to preserve his shot at the presidency.

     Unfortunately, immigration reform is the only serious issue on which
     Rubio has presumed to lead. Otherwise, his time in Washington has
     been quiet and forgettable.

     During the big post-Newtown debate on expanding background checks of
     firearms buyers, Rubio revealed himself as just another gutless
     sniveler controlled by the NRA. In the budget battle he offered not
     a single new idea, only boilerplate attacks on President Obama over
     the federal deficit (which is now, to the chagrin of Republican
     presidential hopefuls, shrinking).

     ...

     Rubio's problem is that he isn't in the mainstream, and he doesn't
     have the conviction to get there. He won't stand up to Beck just
     like he wouldn't stand up to the NRA.

   Hey, Glen Beck hates him. Maybe he's not all bad. On the other hand...

   [38]John Timmer on the cost of burning coal in China.

     Coal is the least efficient of the fossil fuels in terms of the
     amount of energy gained vs. CO2 released. Burning it also releases
     numerous toxic chemicals and particulates, which can exact a cost on
     a country's population in terms of reduced life expectancy and
     increased health costs. Figuring out the exact cost of coal use,
     however, is challenging because of a combination of different
     pollution controls and the mobility of the population.

     Thanks to an unusual combination of policies (some completely
     unrelated to pollution), China has accidentally provided the
     opportunity to put an exact number on the human cost of coal use.
     And that number turns out to be staggering: 5.5 years of reduced
     life expectancy that, when spread over the half-billion people of
     northern China, means a loss of 2.5 billion life-years.

   Two and a half billion years of human life, literally up in smoke.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health

   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       It seems as though MSNBC is airing prior discussions of the

       The problem with saying gay rights will be like race and gender in
       the future and we will hear "of course, how could people ever have
       thought otherwise" is that we clearly have not put discrimination
       by race and gender behind us yet. I hope all three will be in a

   these may actually cancel each other out so the real issues will come
   to the fore (play)

     How about we poll about the behavior of male politicians that's even
     more objectionable. Say those that are attacking civil rights, the
     right to privacy, and the ability of women to make their way in the
     workplace? I know that's not as fun as talking about penis pics,

     But political analysts say New York this year will provide an
     unusual test of how women feel about misbehaving male politicians,
     because there are other alternatives who are equally liberal, if not
     more so, on social issues.
       So political analysts are going to assume that women who vote for
       candidates other than Mr. Spitzer or Mr. Weiner are doing so
       because of the candidate's  misbehavior?  What if the women just
       favor the political platforms of other candidates, and their votes
       have nothing at all to do with men behaving badly?  That's a hell
       of an assumption for "political analysts" to make.

   I wonder what the people who claim they could never vote for Weiner or
   Spitzer think of past presidents Bill Clinton, John F. Kennedy, and
   Franklin D. Roosevelt.

   Bill Clinton was a serial adulterer. We don't know if he "paid" any of
   his mistresses, but I wouldn't be shocked. And it's difficult to defend
   him on the ground of "Well, he had strong progressive values when it
   comes to social morality" because, you know, he didn't.

   JFK was a complete letch who regularly sought the "services" of
   prostitutes and many other women who will not named Jackie.  JFK was
   also a pretty mediocre president.  Much of what was good in the 1960s
   came from LBJ (Great Society, civil rights), and JFK had the Cuban
   Missile Crisis and a CIA-sponsored coup in Iraq.

   FDR also had a long-standing affair with Eleanor's secretary.

 Because he put Bobby in charge ([531]0+ / 0-)
       It seems to be a little known fact that during the Cuban missile
       crisis JFK turned to his brother RFK who acted in a similar role in
       the civil rights issue.  Bobby basically ran both with JFK as the
       front person.
       It could also be pointed out that we wouldn't have had the missile
       crisis at all if JFK had removed the, mostly obsolete, Jupiter
       missiles that the USSR considered a threat.  The deal that turned
       the Russian ships around included removal of these missiles which
       was done without fanfare several months later.  In other words
       there was a reason that the USSR put the missiles in place and once
       that reason was gone they took them away.  It wasn't total USSR end
       the world hysteria as was portrayed at the time but a well
       calculated political move to get into JFK's wheel house and it
       worked. Most still think Russia blinked.  Actually both sides
       blinked and the result was the 'hotline" which improved
       communications and prevented similar almost meltdowns.

 to be clear, JFK was very close to killing us all ([535]0+ / 0-)
       for no good reason.
       In 1962 we had a huge advantage over the soviet nuclear forces.
       Even if they had 100 nuclear bombs on missiles in Cuba, we would
       still have had a "survivable" advantage.
       And to be clear, he didn't want to invade Cuba but every one (in
       the room with him, except maybe his brother) was telling him he had
       to - so he wouldn't be seen as "soft".
       Sure, he made the right decision, in the end.  But even the
       "embargo" almost started an accidental war.  On one Soviet Sub two
       out of three officers were willing to fire a nuclear torpedo.

   The abortion issue isn't really an issue.

   Abortion is legal. And it should be affordable and safe for all women
   when they need it.

   The real issue is prevention so that no one has to go down that path.
   We know how to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, but the
   conservatives are too scared of it. Sex is a four letter word to them.
   And their religious zealotry is making it worse.

   Hopefully, in a couple decades we can make abortion a very limited
   issue. But to do so we need to win the fight on prevention. And to do
   that we need to start retaking the House and state houses as well. It's
   time to clean out the GOP extremists that think we should be back in
   the "old days".

       There are "wanted" planned pregnancies that may need to be
       terminated, if they're ectopic, or the mother's health deteriorates
       badly (preeclampsia, kidney failure, sepsis), or the fetus is far
       too defective to survive. There are also occasional contraceptive
       failures. So abortion IS an issue, and won't go away just by
       wishing it away.
       That said, yes, prevention is a far better route and could continue
       to reduce the demand for abortion. That's why it's outrageous that
       many of the anti-abortion zealots are also opposed to accurate sex
       education and to every way of making contraceptives both accessible
       and affordable (preferably free). And if a woman is raped and goes
       into a Catholic ER, they won't offer her the morning-after pill or
       even tell her about it -- at least it's now available OTC, but you
       have to know about it and know how narrow a window you have to take
       it.

   If the trials - i.e., experiments - are designed appropriately, and in
   a manner to permit comparisons among different trials, the failure of a
   drug to have a consistent effect is the result.  It either works or it
   doesn't, or it works in some people and not others for more than
   reasons of random variability.

   So instead of spending words, energy, money and time blaming the GOP,
   maybe it would be more effective to look to the Dems as a source of
   blame.  After all, just like you can't blame a wolf for being a
   predator, you can't blame the Repubs for being the obstructionist,
   crazy, lying lowlifes that they are.

   The filibuster issue is a prime example of how it's no longer the

   By separating the SNAP program from the farm support portion of the Ag

   been a subsidy accepted by both sides of the political aisle for
   decades.

   The more money that is cut from SNAP, the less money farmers make from
   the government's financing poor people's ability to buy the food the
   farmers and ranchers produce.  Another penny-wise and pound-foolish
   production brought to you by the Republican party - a party that is in
   such disarray it's no longer possible for them to understand that the
   niggardly policies they support on one hand are draining support away
   from policies they support on the other.

   The fact that Milbank misses the point of the action Republicans have
   taken on the Ag bill is no surprise.  He seems to miss the big picture
   most of the time.

   voting for Bill Clinton, Anthony Wiener or Eliot Spitzer. I do not
   condone their personal acts but this is not my focus when voting.
   A dedicated family man who, nevertheless, votes to close abortion and
   family planning clinics and does not support equal pay for women or
   bills banning discrimination will not get my vote.

 On the subject of clinical trials.. ([791]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [792]Bernie68

   I do think that there are generalizations about certain health
   conditions that can be made. People who control blood pressure do
   better. Insulin works for diabetes, certain drugs for childhood
   leukemia routinely save lives etc.. All of these can be proven in
   clinical trials.
   Unfortunately, there are also drug responses and health outcomes that
   are incredibly individual and hard to predict or study. This is why
   there are side effects due to drugs that emerge only after the drug is
   on the market (then there are pharma cos that hid side effects before
   FDA approval but that's another ball of wax)

   I wouldn't throw the baby away with the bathwater though. We still need
   clinical trials and large epidemiological studies.

 Spitzer's Opponent Is Very Good In His Own Right ([804]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   Reading all the coverage of Eliot Spitzer you would think he is running
   against some hack who has no business running for Comptroller.  Nothing
   could be further from the truth.

   Scott Stringer is a fine public servant who has spent his career as a
   reformer both in Albany and as Manhattan Borough President.  I served
   on a Community Board under Stringer and his predecessor.  The
   difference was night and day.  Stringer completely revamped the boards
   taking them from largely patronage driven to inclusive and open
   institutions that reflected the communities they represented.  He has
   done audits of city agencies as Borough President, been a great
   advocate for the people of Manhattan and generally been a thorn in
   Bloomberg's side.

   Stringer was unopposed before Spitzer jumped in the race, something
   that is almost unheard of for a NYC race.  It is a sign of the respect
   and strength of him.

   Stringer is a very strong candidate and don't be at all surprised if he
   comes out on top on Election Day.

 Abortion.... ([810]0+ / 0-)

   I've been thinking about this issue a lot of late.

   I've known men who have been trapped by unwanted pregnancy-into a
   marriage they did not want, into child support for a child they did not
   want, and in one case by a wife who knew he was leaving her so she quit
   taking the pill to ensure she could keep the house and also get child
   support.

   What if men are given the option to file a paper in court saying that
   their choice would be for the woman to abort.  This should only be
   allowed where they are not responsible for the pregnancy, in other
   words, not knowingly engaging in unprotected sex, and I'm not sure how
   you could prove that.  But, having filed this paper, and done so in a
   timely manner-say within the first month or two of the pregnancy, then
   the option would fall to the woman as to whether she wished to continue
   the pregnancy knowing that the man would now be exempt from child
   support.

   This may be crazy, and impractical, but it might point to a way that is
   not only a bit fairer, but puts lots of men on record as personally
   choosing abortion.

 Abortion will still be an issue... ([823]0+ / 0-)
       Because the people on the other side believe just as strongly as
       you that they are fighting to protect the lives and rights of
       individuals. They're not doing it because they hate you or hate
       women. The force of history bends toward increasing human rights,
       but they do not think you are on the right side of that force.
       As it happens, I think the Court got it almost exactly (and
       presciently) right in Roe, both in their interpretation of privacy
       and in their view of gradually accruing protection.
       Now excuse me, I've got to a wallow to tend, buses to maintain, and
       it ain't easy being bilious.
