Remembering Steve Jobs

   I'm truly saddened to learn of Steve Jobs' death. Melinda and I extend
   our sincere condolences to his family and friends, and to everyone
   Steve has touched through his work.

   Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago, and have been colleagues,
   competitors and friends over the course of more than half our lives.

   The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has
   had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come.

   For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it's been an
   insanely great honor.  I will miss Steve immensely.
