   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   This SUCKS.

   Did you hear about the [29]water main break in downtown Portland over
   the weekend?  It was spewing a thousand gallons per minute as it
   flooded a courthouse basement and my favorite music store with two feet
   of water. There's 90 miles of water pipes running under the area that
   are upwards of 100 years old. Federal money for desperately-needed
   infrastructure improvements here and around the country sure would help
   prevent similar catastrophes in the future as well as put a lot of
   people back to work. It ain't gonna happen. But that's not what sucks.

   Perhaps you heard about the several states with Republican governors
   who are saying "No!" to [30]expanding Medicaid as part of the
   Affordable Care Act, meaning a whole bunch of our fellow citizens will
   fall through the cracks of health care reform. Maine is one of those
   states, and thousands of people who otherwise would qualify for health
   care will continue to be left out. But that's not what sucks.

   Perhaps you read about how the sequester is threatening to [31]decimate
   domestic abuse services around the country, including here in Maine.
   But that's not what sucks.

   Even though the federal government has seen to it that our roads and
   bridges and sewers and water pipes continue crumbling to dust and
   rust...even though lots of Americans will be forced to go without
   health care...even though battered and abused women have fewer and
   fewer options for seeking relief...even though domestic services of
   every size and scope and sector of society are being hammered by
   Republican-fueled deficit hysteria and pure unfettered political
   cruelty, that's not what sucks.

   No.

   The federal government, without batting an eyelash, just awarded a $2.8
   billion contract to a Maine shipyard for [32]brand-new Arleigh Burke
   guided-missile destroyers. 500 feet long...Top speed 30+
   knots...Standard missiles, vertical-launch ASROC missiles, Tomahawk
   missiles, MK-46 Torpedoes and a 5 MK 45 Gun. These babies will blow
   your shit away without so much as causing a ripple in the soup the crew
   is slurpin' on below deck.

   We were supposed to get a guarantee of five shiny new warships of mass
   destruction. But thanks to the sequester we're only getting four unless
   they come up with the cash for the fifth by slashing more domestic
   programs or something, which they probably will but it might take a few
   days or even a week. A week!

   That sucks. Where's our priorities, people? Where's our priorities???

   Somebody hold me. All this warship uncertainty is making me feel
   vulnerable.

   Cheers and Jeers starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!]

   CHEERS to sunny days ahead for solar.  Memo to the fossil fuel zombies:
   the tighter you squeeze, the more the green energy sector is going to
   slip through your fingers.  Take sun power for instance.  Brian Dowling
   atThe Hartford Courant says that [37]leasing solar panels is becoming a
   popular way to minimize the hassle and expense of getting off the grid:
   And ya ain't seen nothin' yet.

     The solar company, not you, owns the equipment -- just like car
     dealership owns a leased car. And so in many cases, when it comes
     time for routine maintenance or repairs, the company is responsible.
     When the lease ends, you have the option of buying the system,
     renewing the lease or having it removed. If you move out, the solar
     systems also can be transferred to a new owner.

     SolarCity, a California solar outfit that has offered solar leases
     in Connecticut since 2011, has signed more than 350 leases in the
     state and more than 40,000 countrywide. The company's chairman, Elon
     Musk, is the CEO of electric car company Tesla Motors and spacecraft
     firm Space-X.  This week, Goldman Sachs said it would put up $500
     million in financing for SolarCity leases.

   Last week solar's arch-enemy, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson,
   [38]lamented, "What good is saving the planet if civilization suffers?"
    Amazingly, he wasn't looking into a mirror when he said it.
   Time magazine cover with NJ Gov. Chris Christie
   aka THE COWARD
   WRIGGLE WRIGGLE to Governor Wormy McSquirmy.  New Jersey's
   deficit-hawk-in-charge is going to wave his magic wand
   and---Ta-Daaaa!!!---come up with $24 million [39]for a special election
   this October to fill the late Frank Lautenberg's senate seat.  His
   decision conveniently eliminates any, um, "distractions" between him
   and his re-election just 19 days later in November.  But he still has
   to appoint a placeholder to serve for the next four months, and the tea
   party will be watching him closely (with googly eyes) to make sure he
   or she is appropriately anti-everything.  As for the rest of us, get
   ready for the imminent arrival of a man-made disaster: late-night
   Snooki-for-Senate jokes.

   CHEERS to fighters for truth, justice and the American way.  One of
   America's great journalists and commentators in the Edward R. Murrow
   tradition, Bill Moyers, turns a year  more seasoned today (39, I
   think).  Besides having an impeccable first name, he also has a
   sterling reputation as a straight shooter, a passionate advocate for
   truth and the fundamentals of democracy.  (And it was so nice of him to
   come out of retirment and [40]get back in front of the camera.)  Here,
   munch on some bon Moyers:

     "America's corporate and political elites now form a regime of their
     own and they're privatizing democracy. All the benefits---the tax
     cuts, policies and rewards flow in one direction: up."

   JEERS to the Truly Dumb Moment of the Week.  Really, Turkey?  Your cops
   [41]pepper-sprayed the woman in the red dress?  The one who looks like
   she's just standing there quietly waiting for a bus?  At point-blank
   range?  With a high-pressure garden hose pepper-spray thingee?  While
   cameras were clicking and the Twitterverse was swarming?
   A Turkish riot policeman uses tear gas as people protest against the
   destruction of trees in a park brought about by a pedestrian project,
   in Taksim Square in central Istanbul May 28, 2013. Now that I think
   about it, I'm upgrading this to the Truly Dumb Moment of the Month.

   JEERS to the GOP's very bad horrible no good day.  On June 5, 1933, the
   U.S. went off the gold standard.  Seventy-one years later, on June 5,
   2004, Ronald Reagan died.  If you see any Republicans walking toward
   you with a black cloud hanging over their head today, give 'em a wide
   berth.

   Five years ago in C&J: June 5, 2008

   CHEERS to the end of the end.  It's over.  MSNBC reported last night
   that, with her core support crumbling, [42]Hillary Clinton will bow out
   of the race---and endorse Barack Obama---in D.C. on Saturday.  To say
   she ran a tough campaign would be the understatement of the year, and
   no one will ever forget the trail she blazed---as significant a
   breakthrough for women as Barack is for African-Americans.  With the
   primary contest now rapidly coming to an official end (marked by words
   of class and magnanimity on both sides), we would be remiss if we
   didn't say thank you, kiddie pool splashers, for helping make C&J, for
   the most part, a "safe place" to hang out these last several months
   when the rancor upstairs in the diaries was most intense.  To show our
   gratitude: fresh peaches!  [6/5/13 Update: We still have some peaches
   leftover from that day.  They're a little green and fuzzy, but I tried
   one and they still taste okay.  Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta mosey
   on.  Grandma is calling me into the light.]

   And just one more...

   CHEERS to a world-class throne sitter.  Yesterday marked the [43]60th
   anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation.  Among the events
   that took place across the pond:
   Queen Elizabeth II
   Okay, okay, I admit it.
   She's growing on me.
   -

     > Reenactment of the coronation, Bollywood-style
     > Invasion of France via the Chunnel (Didin't see that comin',
     didja, froggies?!!)
     > The Lighting of the Beacons
     > The Mad Scramble to Put Out the Fires Caused By the Overzealous
     Beacons Committee
     > Bumper hats
     > "Tickle Prince Charles's Frown Upside Down"
     > Double-decker bus joyride to Arthur Treacher's

   The festivities were televised on BBC1, BBC2, BBC3....etc etc...and
   BBC429. So please join me in hoisting a stout and wishing Britain's
   indefatigable mum a hearty...um..."Chim Chim Cher-ee!"  I think that's
   Latin.

   Have a nice Wednesday.  Floor's open...What are you cheering and
   jeering about today?

   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [61]Civil
   Rights, [62]Community, [63]Congress, [64]Culture, [65]Economy,
   [66]Education, [67]Elections, [68]Energy, [69]Environment, [70]Health
   Care, [71]International, [72]Labor, [73]Law, [74]Media, [75]Meta,
   [76]National Security, [77]Science, [78]Transportation, or [79]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([80]California, [81]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       That way, you'll know exactly what they're going to cover on NPR
       and who will be interviewed on Fresh Air. Not because it's listed
       there, but because the cycle is so incestuous. But you should read

       Thank your lucky stars.  I just spent a week with my mother in
       Oklahoma City.  We made it through the latest round of tornadoes -
       there were three in one evening including the largest one on record
       in history, although Mom lost only part of her roof and a giant
       tree that's been in her backyard for 60+ years.  This round of
       twisters cost 18 more lives including 5 more children.  Her
       neighborhood was left with no electricity and no phones (including
       cell service) for about 20 hours, but we were lucky.  When I left
       yesterday, there were still thousands without power.
       But the stout Okies were in church on Sunday, in the dark, reciting
       prayers of thanks to God for sparing those who lived through five
       tornadoes in less than two weeks.  No word on how that same God's
       sending the tornadoes in the first place was rationalized away.
       While there, we took a drive through the area in Moore devastated
       by the May 20th tornado.  I would have taken pictures, but it
       seemed an enormous intrusion on the sobbing people sifting through
       the rubble looking for anything salvageable from their previous
       lives.  The devastation in the path of that tornado is total,
       unimaginable, heartbreaking.  It will take months to haul away the
       debris and years to rebuild the community.  My pictures couldn't
       have adequately portrayed the horror anyway, and there are plenty
       already posted on the web.

 Lavender ([648]8+ / 0-)

       I keep lavender planted on two sides of my patio for mosquito
       protection. Just as its purpose was in the Middle Ages when the
       poor shared the interior of their domicile with pigs and sheep, it
       confuses the olfactory organs and makes anything else impossible to
       smell. It's not permanent but enough to keep them away.
       I garden in the early hours of the morning in summer because I
       don't do heat very well. I use a quick swab of the essential oil on
       my arms and legs which takes care of the midgies and mites that
       like to fly out of the lawn.
       Lavender will grow just about anywhere with a bit of sunshine and

       In the olden days, the pesky buggers pretty much left me alone.
       Since I've relocated to New England, I feel like an all day
       buffet!!  Last year they got after my ankles like they'd never
       tasted flesh before.  This year, it's my arms and hands.
       WTH??!!??
       So, lavender it is, and here's hoping the little flying bastids
       will leave me in peace.
       I, and my itchy carcass, thank you!

       "plowshares" idea.  It worked after WWII, when defense companies
       started making washers and dryers and stoves and whatnots.  Why not
       now??
       Besides, I could always use another 'whatnot'.
       Green energy is the way to go, as is highspeed rail.  Get ahead of
       the curve, make lots of money AND employ lots of people.  A

   Shipbuilding has been a coastal Maine industry for at least a century.
    What is newish (last 40 years or so) is that military shipbuilding is
   all there is.

 Washburn and Doughty ([1079]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [1080]commonmass

       I was remembering the news surrounding the fire at Washburn and
       Doughty, East Boothbay, 2010.  They had two 100' +/- tugboats under
       construction at the time.  Business was described as having been
       good for some time.  Yet, the yard was closed and the business
       abandoned.  Obviously, the hurdles that could not be overcome were
       not the availability of workers, the demand for their products, or
       the regulatory requirements imposed by the State of Maine.  I am
       sure there were issues there, but I am equally sure all parties
       would have worked with the owners to reopen if that were an
       alternative future on offer.
       It seems to me more likely than not that the barrier was in the
       entrepreneurial culture itself.  It was not in Washburn and
       Doughty, they were successful entrepreneurs.  They stood alone dong
       that work after seeing similar business closing all along the coast
       because of a wider problem.  It seems more likely than not to me
       that the element of that business culture that was common to all of
       them was finance.
       I strongly suspect that no one would be surprised to have that
       confirmed.  Having tried to get the University of Maine to work on
       practical economic problems, where the problem's cause was likely
       to be some of Maine's plutocrats, I am also not surprised that what
       we read about this is ... (crickets).

       dog-doo in (although from now on I'll be saving it for LePage) and

       that doesn't have HFCS. Hallelujah.
       I have yet to figure out where Maine Hardware is, but driving up to
       Falmouth Ace from East Deering is like a gift for me. Despite the
       bridge construction, every time I see the water it just takes my

       I cH that place so much; the staff are awesome.
       It's in that awful St. John St. Plaza at the intersection of St.
       John & Congress, near the Greyhound Bus station. There's Jan Mee
       Chinese Buffet (don't eat there), a sub-discount grocery store
       (don't shop there), a Catholic Charities thrift store (bargains!)
       and a music shop if you're so inclined. But Maine Hardware is the
       ONLY hardware store in Portland. The kind of place where you can go
       in and say something like "...I need this thing, I don't know what
       it's called, but it's about [make vague hand shape to indicate
       size] and it kind of looks like that other doo-hickey with the
       little thing on the side? It's for a sink?" and they will take you
       immediately to the thing you are describing, tell you the name of
       it, and never make you feel stupid for not knowing what it was
       called in the first place.

       relatively easy to navigate after a while, but getting there drove

   a little Scots lady I took care of during the 90s.Jeannie
   had been born 3 months after Victoria's death.She remembered Edward
   VII,George and Mary-and that is when her memory got a trifle shaky.
            One day,she was  napping in her wheelchair when
   she suddenly woke up and demanded loudly-"Is the Prince
   Of Wales stil lhaving things to do with that Mrs.Simpson?!"
    Well,I did'nt have the heart to tel lher about the abdication
    She was back a few decades and that was her reality.So
   I told Mrs.Simpson had passed away,and the Prince of Wales had passed
   away of grief and his brother had gotten the throne.She accepted
   this,and then we sang 'God Save
   The King.'made her a cup of tea,and all was well.

       Yes,I am a bit damp aound the edges,recalling Jeannie-
       she was one of my favourite charges.He father had been
       a'great Burns man' as Jeanie put it ,and she could yet
       recite/sing  poems/songs she had heard eighty odd years
       ago.
           She also took to callling people who annoyed her
       'ye b*tch'.
           This after a lifetime of being very strict about how her
       children used the name of God.

   her keep her "reality" without stress!!  (((hugs)))

   When my dear MIL was fading from the world, she insisted that we had
   twin daughters who never came to see her!  My Beloved tried to 'reason'
   with her, by telling her that we'd never had twin daughters!  It upset
   her mightily.  I asked him how he'd feel if he woke up one morning, and
   people tried to convince him that his entire reality was untrue.

   He never did it again.

   Bless your dear heart, swampyankee!!  You made that lovely lady's last
   years so much less stressful, and by listening to her stories....so
   much more enjoyable--for both of you!

   done away with male-only heirs and made it first-born, I'm hoping the
   baby will be a little girl every bit as cute as the Duchess of
   Cambridge who looks prettier now with that smidgin of 'roundness' to
   her facial features that has come with her pregnancy.  She was getting

       Birds are such a treat.  I really like them but I know I don't have

       My friend who had the Macaw also obtained a sulphur-crested
       cockatoo, a couple of cockatiels (one of them loved to walk up my
       arm, sit on my shoulder and do kisses in my ear), an African green.
        She had several different sizes of cages in her place that had
       extraordinarily high ceilings.  After her new (second) husband died
       in a horrific helicopter accident (he was a news photographer, and
       he and the helicopter pilot both died), my friend started
       collecting birds, and when she ceased communications with any of
       her friends, I had to wonder if she started hoarding birds - I
       moved several states away about that time so I have no idea what
       happened to her.

   you give credit where credit is do) to our governor for not even
   thinking about bucking the expansion of Medicaid - even though she is a
   Republican.  Fortunately she also has enough Democratic votes in the
   Legislature to get it through.  That may be why she did not put up a
   fight - that and the millions of dollars it brings to New Mexico.  I
   guess she is smarter than Rick Perry, but than pond scum is smarter
   than Rick Perry.

   Cheers again to Amy Orlando, our former District Attorney and friend of
   the Gov. (and another Republican), for actually getting a conviction as
   special prosecutor in a triple murder case!  Three consecutive life
   sentences, or no chance of parole for ninety years.  The guy richly
   deserved it, having threatened the main witness, told his mother he
   wanted to kill the people he killed, and for fancying himself a Mafia
   don who could not be touched.  In the end the defense gave up - how can
   you defend an idiot who leaves clues all over the place and who brags
   about the murders, saying he would like to do it again, it was so
   satisfying! I know several people who knew both the perp and his
   victims.

   You missed the chance to give good advice to the youngsters of
   Portland:  Make mud pies and mud grenades.  That's what my generation
   did with wonderful events like floods and water main breaks (assuming
   we had water mains to break.  Floods, we had).

   In later years, my generation would forget about the mud pies and pray
   for select court records to be destroyed, but that's another story.

   [1893][Marko-Kevin.gif] Yes, we laugh at your puny flooded basements!

   Not really, our sympathies are in order. Nobody should laugh at soggy
   music stores. Over here in Prague this week we know a thing or two
   about flooding. Waters are finally going down. North of us some towns
   are still at risk and the jolly Danube down south is still causing
   trouble. Gorgeous, bright, sunny day today should help cheer up the
   soggy mess outside.

   I've spent the last few days with a grim cold. Low grade fever, cough
   and now the nasal flooding has started. Should all be flushed away
   soon.

   Sent about half a gigabyte of data to a client and saved myself having
   to brave the perils of mass transit chaos to get to the meeting today.
   Most of the subway system has been closed due to the flooding. I won't
   be there in person to explain or support my ideas but at this point I'm
   just willing to be the silent grunt worker. I'm supposed to be putting
   together a book-- typesetting, graphic design, color correction, image
   retouching-- and I can't even get them to give me a finalized text.
   Sigh, jeers  to projects that never seem to end and the drudgery of
   having to redo the same stuff over and over and over ...

   But a big cheers to the folks that set up free data transfer web sites!
   Saved my stubby tail again.

   Well, my ally at the meeting today should be letting me know how things
   went soon. With a bit of luck the boss man will be getting his act
   together and I'll be finally able to really do my job and put this book
   in the hands of the printers.

   Hoping everyone here is doing well. Be glad you're not seated too close
   to me today-- it was garlic soup for lunch! I'm breathin' fire.

   If you're still in Oregon there's bound to be a health food store or
   herbalist within spitting distance....pick up some black ointment (aka
   black salve or drawing salve). It should be an horrible black/greenish
   color (more black than green) and smell like pine tar. Great for
   infections, splinters and thorns (which one might get while
   camping....). Grew up using the stuff--it was the one thing in Mom's
   medicine cabinet that was never allowed to go out.

   Especially good for those moments when a clinic might not be so
   handy...

       for ya: It looks 'mascerated', 'angry', and 'exploded'! heh.
       I know infections are no laughing matter--that's why I went to the
       urgent care instead of trying a non-M.D. remedy. I'll mess with
       some things, but not an infection. Once they've settled in & start
       growing, well, I don't rely on salves when antibiotics work so
       well.
       And about Ichthammol oint--yeah, it was mom's @ my house too, and
       it didn't leave the bathroom. I assumed it was precious, never to
       be lost. We had the same, re-purposed little jar of it my entire

   You may have guessed by now that three years of law school in Cleveland
   was very challenging for me. Three DAYS of cloudy, thinking about rain,
   is challenging. (That's the weather, not me. Just RAIN already....)

   Patience is not a virtue, it's just enabling bad behavior...

   Cheers to business being good...keeps my job interesting.

   MEGA cheers to extra work--Monday I got a request to proofread more
   Bible (which always tempts me to send my sister snarky notes with
   biblical references). Yesterday, I got a request to copy edit a novel
   (due by next Tuesday, so .... tight, tight turnaround.). Hoping this
   turns the financial tide for me, even though the tradeoff is it mucks
   up my writing time. Still, I did promise to pay those bills....

   Cheers to caffeine.

   CHEERS to warmer weather, in the 80's, with a couple of days in the low
   nineties. Could do w/o the '90's, tho. And,

   CHEERS to an EXCELLENT post today, Bill. And,

   CHEERS to little Madam Belle. She has to be the most generous little
   dog ever. When Annie (Joan's dog) is here, Belle lets her play with
   whatever toy she wants (except chipmunk, which has to be put on the
   mantle, lest it gets buried somewhere in the back yard). Also, if Belle
   is playing with a toy and Annie wants it, Belle gives it up. The piece
   of antler is a slightly different story, tho. For a while, Annie would
   hump Belle when she wanted the antler, and Belle would sigh and give it
   up. Now she has become  mostly immune to the humping, tho Annie will
   try for a long time. It is hilarious to watch. Both dogs love babies
   and little kids. Nice woozles. And,

   CHEERS to Koslanders. Stay strong, stay healthy, and most of all, stay
   weird. Oh, and don't forget to write.

   Love, mcmom

       I think the folks down in the Kittery shipyard (and maybe the one
       in Connecticut, if it's still active) do the subs.
       Yeah it is a financial boost for Bath and the state.  I just wish
       we'd stop relying on gigantic military expenditures for these
       boosts, when there are so many cockadoody domestic projects that
       could be focused on.
       Our love affair with things that kill and destroy---as demonstrated
       by the size of the expenditures we sink into them---is obscene.
       We're basically the universe's biggest war machine, and somehow we
       find the gall to claim the mantle of being the world's peace
       broker.
       As for the doofus governor, he'll look back at his one and only
       term in office and wonder how it all went by so fast. As long as
       the Dems in the legislature keep him bottled up, the damage he did
       will be limited.
