     * Today's [29]comic by Ruben Bolling is [30]The Wizard of Oz - the
       Aftermath:
       [31]Cartoon by Ruben Bolling - The Wizard of Oz - The Aftermath
     * [32]ADP reports 176,000 private-sector jobs added in August:
       Despite having modified its methods, the report almost always
       reports a significantly different number of jobs being created each
       month than does the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
     * [33]NRA worried NSA surveillance could lead to gun registry. The
       gun manufacturers' lobby filed an amicus brief in an American Civil
       Liberties Union lawsuit saying that a gun registry could be created
       under Section 215 of the Patriot Act:

     "Under the government's reading of Section 215, the government could
     simply demand the periodic submission of all firearms dealers'
     transaction records, then centralize them in a database indexed by
     the buyers' names for later searching," the brief read.

     When that government-mandated data is combined with phone call logs
     obtained by the National Security Agency -- including gun owner's
     calls to shooting ranges, gun stores or the NRA -- the government
     could predict with "near certainty" who owns a firearm, the
     organization argued.
     * [34]Former senior EPA adviser collected $900,000 in pay fraud:

     Over the past 12 years, John C. Beale was often away from his job as
     a high-level staffer at the Environmental Protection Agency. He
     cultivated an air of mystery and explained his lengthy absences by
     telling his bosses that he was doing top-secret work, including for
     the CIA.

     For years, apparently, no one checked.
     * [35]Florida man claims Bush Doctrine as defense in Labor Day
       slayings:

     Lawyers for a Florida man this week cited President George W. Bush's
     pre-emptive war in Iraq and the "Bush Doctrine" as a defense after
     their client killed two neighbors and attempted to kill a third on
     Labor Day.
     * [36]Navy admits training exercises will kill hundreds of whales and
       dolphins:

     Navy training and testing could inadvertently kill hundreds of
     whales and dolphins and injure thousands over the next five years,
     mostly as a result of detonating explosives underwater, according to
     two environmental impact statements the military released [last
     week] [...]

     Most of the deaths would come from explosives, though some might
     come from testing sonar or animals being hit by ships.
     * [37]In case you were wondering about that National Zoo panda cub.
     * [38]JAMA: Women physicians make $50,000 less than men:

     Men made $221,297 a year, while women made just $165,278. In fact,
     women's earnings are just now reaching the level of what men made 20
     years ago: $168,795. Women account for one-third of all doctors and
     half of medical school students.
     * [39]TSA officially allowed to lie to you:

     The TSA is allowed to lie in its responses to Freedom of Information
     Requests. Its court-granted ability to lie to the public it
     nominally serves isn't limited to sensitive issues, either: they're
     allowed to pretend that they don't have CCTV footage of their own
     officers violating their own policies, even when they do.

       Today's Kagro in the Morning show featured a rebroadcast of our
       September 6, 2012 show, from the Democratic National Convention in
       Charlotte, NC. Greg Dworkin rounded up the day's news, speech
       reactions & polls. Bill Clinton had brought the house down the
       night before, so it was up to Jennifer Rubin & the AP "fact
       checkers" to bring Clinton down in return. It was an unfair fight,
       but that just made the pathetic attempts all the more entertaining
       for us! Also: musings on convention logistics, the street scapes,
       the heavily militarized police presence, and RachelLive's ability
       to wrangle prime seating for the previous night's events!

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   baby pandas.  As animals they're very inefficient, eating only certain
   kinds of bamboo in the wild, and have to be helped to reproduce, since
   they apparently can't manage it by themselves.  On their own, they'd go
   extinct.

   Feel like a grump because according to USA law, it's perfectly okay to
   kill whoever you like, rape whoever you want (you'll only get 30 days,
   if that), and if you're a little girl who grows up to be a doctor you
   won't make enough to pay back your med school loans.

   And on top of that, a recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize wants to
   be, like his predecessor, "uh wore prezzi-dent."

   Other than that, it's a lovely day!

   [132]Heh.

        If a bunch of governors got together and wrote a book on things
     to avoid when you're a state executive, South Carolina Gov. Nikki
     Haley might have an entertaining and lighthearted chapter to
     contribute.

         "What not to do ... getting locked out of the Governor's mansion
     in your robe while sending the kids off to school.
     sigh...#adayinthelife," Haley wrote on her public Facebook page
     Wednesday morning.

         The post quickly generated buzz on Facebook, collecting more
     than 4,400 likes and close to 550 comments as of Wednesday night.

         But the governor wasn't forced out of her house for too long.
     Her communications director, Doug Mayer, told CNN she was only
     outside for a "couple minutes" before her daughter, Rena, let her
     back in.

 I dont think that's correct about ADP ([219]0+ / 0-)

   Did you mean ADP always show more jobs created than BLS?

   I dont think that is true.

   If you look at the first chart [220]here

   In the first five months of 2013, the initial ADP report showed less
   jobs created than in the initial BLS private payrolls report.

   BLS obviously includes public sector jobs, where we have seen losses.
   But ADP does not. At least since their methodology changed in Oct 2012,
   it looks like they have more often underestimated private sector job
   creation vs BLS.

 Sorry, I meant, in the first five months ([223]0+ / 0-)
       it looks like ADP underestimated private sector growth vs. BLS in
       three of the five months.

 no. It shows a different number of jobs... ([227]0+ / 0-)
       ...created, sometimes higher, sometimes lower. You have to be
       careful, by the way, with their graph. They revise it each month
       for as long ago as a year. But I keep track of the numbers as they
       present them.

 I wished I hadn't read the article ([231]0+ / 0-)

   about the Navy exercises that cause so much damage. It breaks my heart.
   Hawaii is getting to be ruined for good and for ever and one reason for
   is whatever the government is doing there in the name of national
   security and defense, not to say that huge corporations buy the whole
   islands and its politicians as well. It's so discouraging and
   depressing.

 Anecdotal story on the doc pay gap ([238]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [239]wintergreen8694

   My wife finished fellowship during the crash of 08.  We were nervous
   about where she was going to work since it seemed no one was hiring.

   She took the first offer from a practice in the town where we are now
   and refused to counter because she was so scared she wouldn't have a
   job.

   I don't know if more women are like this than men, but she was so risk
   adverse, I think she lost out on 20-30K/year.

 Nature vs Nurture: Are Guns in the Blood? ([242]4+ / 0-)

   Interesting convo ongoing this AM in BadKitties diary. If you care at
   all about the urban/rural divide on "gun culture" please drop by and
   share your thoughts on her dilemma.

   Firearms Law and Policy published our second diary last night,
   [247]Nature vs Nurture: Are Guns in the Blood? by [248]BadKitties.
   Cheers to BadKitties and all who stopped by for an interesting
   conversation, that continues this morning. Please join us!

   We are planning to walk all across the country, state-by-state, and
   will dedicate a diary to a survey of each state's gun laws. If you
   would like to write about gun laws in your state please send a Kosmail
   to [249]LilithGardener.

   Please drop by our Glossary of great links to law and policy resources,
   [250]Introducing a new Group: Firearms Law and Policy - Glossary of
   Resources.

   To join and write for us Kosmail [251]LilithGardener.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   To advocate effectively for repeal or passage of firearms legislation
   we must first know and understand current law and policy, and how both
   are implemented, where we live. There is enormous variability across
   the country; the relative utility/relative risk of firearms is
   different on a 500 acre ranch in Montana than for a 1000 square foot
   apartment in New York. State and local laws reflect that diversity. We
   will discuss firearms law and policy with an emphasis on the many
   historical ethics and ideals of Western Civilization, as opposed to
   what are currently known as "Libertarian" ideals.

   This group is also a study group; a place to learn and discuss which
   gun regulations are constitutional restrictions in this post-Heller
   environment. (A law degree is not required). With Congressional
   gridlock likely to impede any useful national legislation, progress
   will have to be made at the state and local level.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ------------------------------
   Please note: We are not a subgroup of the Daily Kos RKBA group and do
   not agree with their foundation premise, but hope they will share their
   insights into state and local laws that work.

 The male/female pay differential in medicine.... ([314]0+ / 0-)

   is not a simple tale of sexism and bias. The actual, you know, evidence
   on the subject is informative.

   1) There have been major changes in the physician workforce in recent
   decades, but female graduates are still less likely to choose careers
   in procedural fields like thoracic surgery/neurosurgery that are far
   better paid than primary care. Conversely, pediatrics is now
   overwhelmingly a female field, and pediatricians are relatively quite
   poorly paid compared to surgeons. I believe this explains most of the
   male/female income disparity.

   2) Physician income tracks pretty well with willingness to work
   grueling hours out of the gate. Female graduates have been less willing
   to work 100 hours a week than male grads on average, and this disparity
   is exacerbated by time off for having kids. I'm not saying whether
   that's good or bad, but it simply is. One can argue endlessly about
   whether it's fair for female docs to take more time off work than their
   partners when they have kids, but that's generally what happens. Taking
   3 months or 6 months off work, and then returning to work on a reduced
   schedule is typical for moms who happen to be doctors, and that is a
   drag on income during peak earning years.

   3) Female surgeons willing to work the same brutal hours as the guys
   are paid just as well as the guys. The head of surgery when I was a
   medical student was female, and she was a fabulous clinician who
   operated on my wife. But she had no life outside the hospital. More
   female docs look at the trade off and decide to step off the treadmill
   and take a more humane track.

   4) Naked sexism and the 'old boys' club'? Yeah, it still exits. I have
   no doubt that most female docs can tell some tales. But it's less and
   less of the story all the time.

 On the TSA lying excerpt ([317]0+ / 0-)

   Ehh, not really.  I strongly dislike the TSA, but the self-serving rant
   from the pro se plaintiff isn't actually found in the court opinion it
   is based on.

   More than that, this is a guy who decided he wouldn't be searched at
   the airport, and literally made a Federal Case out of it.  Fine I
   guess, but not really a martyr in my eyes.  Really doesn't merit front
   page treatment.
