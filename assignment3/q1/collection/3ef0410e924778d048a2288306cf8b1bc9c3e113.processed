[24]Senate concludes full chamber caucus, details of McCain's 'deal' emerge

   U.S. Capitol dome in storm
   The full Senate met this evening for three and a half hours in the Old
   Senate Chamber in a rare full caucus to discuss filibuster rules. As of
   now, no deal have been struck. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had a
   [30]very short statement as the meeting broke up: "The conversation is
   going to continue tonight. Votes are scheduled at 10 in the morning."

   Sen. John Thune (R-SD) spoke briefly with reporters as well, as the
   meeting broke up. He said that Republicans were "willing to do two
   nominations, but the Democrats aren't willing, and that the "NRLB is
   the real point of contention." The Republicans believe they were
   "illegally made," though Republicans would apparently be willing to
   allow Richard Cordray, who--if the Republicans were being honest--was
   also an "illegal" recess appointment. Republicans aren't being honest.
   They want to kill the NRLB.

   Before the meeting convened details of Sen. John McCain's [31]bad deal
   emerged, and they're actually worse than originally hinted. Here's what
   McCain [32]has offered on behalf of Republicans.

     McCain told Reid he found the six GOP senators needed to join
     Democrats in breaking filibusters of the nominations, giving
     Democrats a key part of what they want: approval of Richard Cordray
     to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
     McCain told Reid that in exchange, the president would have to agree
     to withdraw two nominees for the National Labor Relations Board whom
     Mr. Obama had put in office by recess appointment, Sharon Block and
     Richard Griffin. Republicans disputed those appointments, and the
     Supreme Court agreed to take up the case.

   Republicans would be happy to [33]confirm three other NLRB nominees,
   two of which are Republicans. That would give the NLRB a quorum to
   continue to function: a quorum dominated by Republican members. The
   Democratic president's NRLB would thus be in Republican hands.
   Compromise!

     "It's almost like the 2012 election never happened," said Bill
     Samuel, director of government affairs at the AFL-CIO labor
     federation. "It's not an offer--it's a charade."

   [34]Keep up the pressure through Tuesday morning. Send an email to
   Harry Reid and your Democratic senators telling them to hang tough and
   to vote for real filibuster reform.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 "Illegal Nominations"? There is no such thing!! ([173]6+ / 0-)

       The Republicans might be able to make an argument that the recess
       appointments were illegal, thanks to our now thoroughly corrupt,
       right-wing judiciary. But there is a big, and very obvious (to any
       10 year old with a functioning brain and a dictionary) difference
       between an APPOINTMENT and a NOMINATION. The President of The
       United States can nominate whomever the fuck he wants.
       I challenge Le Turtle or any of his turtle acolytes to find any law
       or legal opinion anywhere that defines an illegal nomination.
       Question: Have Harry and the craven Democrats even pointed this
       out? Or do we now allow the Republicans to simply make up whatever
       absolute nonsense they want without calling bullshit? Le Turtle
       bluffs and blusters precisely because he know he WON'T get called
       on it.

   The filibuster is just another tool for cowardly Senators to hide their
   motives.  End it now and get a little done, or let the Republicans end
   it later.  It's time for some accountability--especially from the tiny
   Democrats.  Hopefully there may be a little bit of integrity left in
   the Party.

   In the GOP your status is inversely proportional to your integrity.

 Without the filibuster ([347]1+ / 0-)

       we would have had privatized SS in time for the Great Recession.
       How about we instead attach a political price to the filibuster?
       Force an actual filibuster.  Force the media to notice when
       obstruction takes place.  If the obstruction is backed by the
       public, then it will be successful.  If not, there will be a
       backlash.
       Not that the public is up to the task, but it seems far safer than
       letting the GOP have free reign next time they seize control of our
       government, which may not be so far in the future.

   In addition to simple majority vote for executive branch positions, we
   need up or down confirmation votes for the HUGE backlog of judicial
   vacancies, for any Supreme Court vacancies to remedy the decades of
   right-wing court packing, and need to require a real, talking
   filibuster in the manner of Wendy Davis or Jimmy Stewart for Senators
   who want to obstruct the Senate doing the people's business in general.
