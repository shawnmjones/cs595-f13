[23]Transportation secretary warns of airport closures and major delays due
to sequester

   airplane in the sky
   Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood [30]laid out the likely impact of
   the sequester on the nation's air travel, and there's a lot not to
   like. Because the Federal Aviation Administration would be forced to
   furlough "the vast majority" of its employees for one or two days per
   pay period, [31]more than 100 air control towers at small airports
   might be forced to close entirely. [32]Fewer air traffic controllers on
   duty at larger airports, meanwhile, mean:

     * Flights to major cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco
       could experience delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours
       because we will have fewer controllers on staff.
     * Delays in those major airports will ripple across the country.

   That means airlines are likely to cut flights. Runway equipment
   maintenance and repair could also be affected, creating still more
   sources of delays.

   And of course, all of these delays and inconveniences in the lives of
   non-federal workers will come because of pay cuts of up to 20 percent
   for, in the case of the FAA, nearly 47,000 workers. That will have a
   ripple effect on the economy as they cut back on their regular
   spending, affecting stores and restaurants in their communities. All
   because Republicans are pushing cuts cuts cuts with no revenue
   increases to balance them out, [33]against the will of the American
   people.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       the military still has combat flight ops going on halfway around
       the world... unlike 1980, their air traffic controllers are
       busy...and they will not be pulled out of that area of operations
       to cover civilian air traffic...

   but airport maintenance etc do not fall under the pervue of the FAA.

   [150]Airlines.org

     "The airport operator has management control of the airport, meaning
     that the operator has the right to operate and develop the airport.
     The airport operator is responsible for the airport's long- and
     short-term planning, financial performance, maintenance, operation
     and compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and
     regulations. Historically, airlines and airports have worked
     cooperatively to facilitate passenger needs and to achieve smooth
     and efficient operations for airlines."

   Now what could happen is that maintenance work that must be inspected
   by the FAA could be delayed because no one is available to inspect it.

   Why is it that, as a culture, we are more comfortable seeing two men
   holding guns than holding hands?

       but not directly by the FAA maintenance is handled by contractors

       they will be maintained. Especially considering some are also used

   It's not "fun" on the inside. The Department of Defense pays my
   husband's salary. It also pays his military retirement pension, and it
   provides our health insurance. Already, the contractor my husband works
   for is cutting back on compensation, with more cuts planned, because
   they can no longer be certain they'll get paid or the contract will be
   retained. Since my husband trains a specific group of Air Force flyers,
   cutting back on the number of flight hours directly affects his job. It
   also affects military readiness in a specialty that is already too
   small and overworked.

   No, the GOP tantrum's results are not "fun" at all. There are people
   inside those uniforms; there are families relying on those "suits".

   I mean companies (or individuals) that own (or lease) their own private
   jets to fly their high executives around the country. I'm guessing even
   they require federal air traffic control. What a shame it would be if
   the Koch brothers or Sheldon Adelson couldn't get to some big

   control system was functioning at only some minimal level because of

        The LaHood letter talks about closing towers altogether and I

       I misinterpreted your post.
       A lot of the little airports operate on limited hours now. I know
       some aren't staffed between 11pm to 7am. IIRC, you can only land at
       those if you're flying under visual flight rules.
       I wonder -- if the major airlines have to cut flights, what does
       that do to companies like Netjet?

 Convenience, Efficiency, Safety ([346]0+ / 0-)
       Visual flight rules and instrument flight rules are unrelated to
       whether there is a tower operating on the field.  A flight most
       certainly can arrive or depart under instrument flight rules at an
       airport without an operating control tower.  In fact, it's not even
       unusual.
       At an airport with a control tower, the tower personnel deliver
       your IFR clearance before takeoff and close your IFR flight plan
       after you land.  At an airport without a tower, you call up a
       flight service station and get your IFR clearance by phone, and you
       close it (again) by phone, or in some cases over the radio prior to
       landing.
       Because each clearance delivered in this manner requires an ATC
       void time (a generous departure window), it reduces traffic
       capacity to about six departures an hour (or less), compared to
       maybe 30 best case with an operating tower.
       And of course an operating control tower is a very nice safety
       enhancement, particularly if they have radar.  It might surprise
       you to know that not all towers have a radar screen.

   Will congressional staffs also be cut?  Would eliminating the failed
   F-35 and the limited use Osprey save enough money to eliminate the
   sequester?  How about also doing away with many of the farm subsidies?

   "As many as 11,000 civilian employees at Fort Bliss and a total of
   800,000 Department of Defense civilian workers worldwide could face
   repeated furloughs if a budget deal can't be worked out in Washington,
   D.C., and automatic spending cuts kick in March 1.
   More than 7,000 civilian employees at White Sands Missile Range and
   Holloman Air Force Base could also be affected. The furloughs would be
   structured so that nearly all of the 800,000 civilian employees would
   lose one day of work per week for 22 weeks, starting in late April,
   officials said.
   That translates to losing 20 percent of their pay during that period."

 Recycled comment -- Will air fares go down? ([552]0+ / 0-)

   Federal Spending Cuts Threaten Delays in Air Travel
    [553]http://www.nytimes.com/....

     WASHINGTON -- Airlines and airports across the country are preparing
     for across-the-board federal budget cuts due to hit next week as if
     they were a hurricane, although with even less certainty about how
     many flights they will have to cancel and how many passengers will
     be stranded. The federal government is warning about delays that
     could begin in March, as the first cuts take effect, and reduced
     takeoffs and slower security lines that could worsen in April with
     furloughs.
      Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has told Congress that most of
     the Federal Aviation Administration's 47,000 employees would face a
     day of furlough per two-week pay period, meaning on average about 10
     percent fewer workers on any given day. There are about 14,750 air
     traffic controllers, including trainees, so that would mean on every
     shift there would be substantially fewer in all. In some areas, like
     New York, there could be problems even in advance of furloughs, if
     overtime budgets are cut.

     To handle such a major staff shortage but still maintain safety,
     federal aviation officials said they would accept fewer airplanes
     into the system, the same tactic they use in bad weather. That means
     that in places where airplanes normally follow one another with a
     six- or seven-mile gap, there might be a 10- to 20-mile gap. As a
     result, passengers may sit on tarmacs and endure delays as they wait
     for planes to push back from the gate.

   Well, last night I was pricing flights to the Netroots Nation
   convention in San Jose this June.  They're pretty expensive.  To save
   money I was even considering driving 80 miles to the Austin airport to
   catch a cheaper nonstop -- to San Francisco airport, not San Jose, and
   then taking a shuttle to the hotel.  I didn't do anything, wondering if
   something might make air fares go down.
    So this morning, I saw the news story I quoted some of above.  I think
   I'll wait and see if the sequester goes into effect and air travel goes
   to hell.  Enough people might be persuaded not to fly that air fares
   might go down.  On the other hand, if the airlines cancel flights and
   not as many people give up on travel, fares might go up.  I don't think
   the sequester, if it happens, will last until June, but it's possible
   Congress might kick the can down the road to June 1, and the sequester
   might happen then.

   Maybe I'll just give up on the convention, and on any trip I can't make
   by train or automobile this summer.  Hey, tourism industry, I won't be
   alone in doing that.  You might want to lobby Congress to quit trying
   to run the country on the cheap.

   We're all pretty strange one way or another; some of us just hide it
   better. "Normal" is a dryer setting.

   The sequester is really starting to piss me off.  It seems like both
   sides have decided to wait until after the damage is done to even
   attempt to fix anything.  The American people should not be used as
   pawns in their political game.  These have real consequences for
   regular people and it is completely avoidable.

   I have to take a plane several times in the next month.  I don't want
   to have to go through more hassle just so that one party or the other
   can try to gain some sort of political advantage by making my life more
   difficult.  Get a deal done now.  Don't wait until after it starts
   hurting people.

     And of course, all of these delays and inconveniences in the lives
     of non-federal workers will come because of pay cuts of up to 20
     percent for, in the case of the FAA, nearly 47,000 workers.

   Huh?

   It's a 3% cut across the board.  Yes, coming late in the year, it will
   be harder this first year, but c'mon.  This is simply more scare tactic
   bullshit. If there is any organization that can easily absorb 3% cuts,
   it is our federal government.

   The FAA can avoid ALL furloughs by scaling back capital spending
   projects, or simply delaying them.

   The same goes for the military.  Instead of cutting a battleship, they
   scare us by threatening to reduce troop readiness.  It's all bullshit.

       Those cuts are coming on top of a reduced budget for this year
       because ALL Federal agencies are running under a continuing
       resolution.
       They've already spent five months of funds -- so they've got to
       make the cuts in what they will be getting until the CR runs out on
       March 27th.
       Since it looks unlikely that the Repubs will let Congress do
       anything, the next few weeks will be the audition for the REAL
       government shutdown...just in time for Easter...

 The Continuing Resolution Runs Out 3/27 ([587]0+ / 0-)
       I'm a retired Federal employee -- I have experienced several
       government shutdowns over my 33 year career.
       It's not the amount of money, the regs say if there is no
       appropriated money, then we have to shutdown.
       Now, over the years SOME agencies have managed to acquire a funding
       stream from non-appropriated money. In the case of HHS -- some of
       its' agencies are partially funded by the Medicare tax because they
       have oversight of the Medicare program.
       Even so, this will still mean furloughs, which means a reduction in
       pay -- which means the areas where the Federal employee works will
       see less money, because the employees will be forced to cut back on
       personal spending.

   and maybe someone can explain it to me, is this insistance that revenue
   increases be balanced by spending cuts.

     Republicans are pushing cuts cuts cuts with no revenue increases to
     balance them out,

   Not just here, but pretty much any conversation about the deficit or
   the sequester or that talks about the "Grand Bargain" has similar
   verbiage.

   Balance generally means two opposing things cancel each other leaving
   the system in the same condition: sitting on one side of a teeter
   totter is balanced by someone of equal weight sitting on the other
   side.

   In context of the deficit, revenue increases make the deficit go down,
   and expenditure cuts also make the deficit go down. Where is the
   balance? This would make sense if expenditures going UP had to be
   balanced by taxes going UP to pay for them (keeping the deficit
   'balanced' if that is the goal)... But if lowering the deficit is the
   goal, then either expenditure cuts or tax increases would do.

   We tried cutting taxes then cutting spending to make up for it, that
   would seem 'balanced' but that didn't work very well, leaving the 99%
   in a lingering depression. If we are going for 'balance' we should try
   raising taxes and spending the extra money we bring in.

 Correct me if I am wrong ([607]0+ / 0-)

   but if we have cuts with increases that balance them out, how are they
   cuts? If you take 20% away and add it back, there is no cut. Or is this
   a way for the left to say you want cuts here, but not here? If so, why
   would you be against such a large cut to the military while it leaves
   SS/health care untouched? I understand that no vuts is preferable, but
   that is not going to happen, and the next time, they may include areas
   we hold in higher contempt without military cuts. IoW, Be careful what
