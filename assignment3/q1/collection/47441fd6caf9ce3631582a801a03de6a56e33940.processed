Congress vs. public opinion

   Associated Press

   Gallup released [3]an interesting poll on immigration reform yesterday,
   which opponents of immigration reform probably didn't like. The
   pollster reported:

     A majority of Americans would vote for each of six different policy
     changes that Congress is considering as part of a comprehensive
     immigration reform bill. Support ranges from a high of 87% for a
     multifaceted pathway to citizenship that includes a long waiting
     period, taxes and a penalty, background checks, and learning
     English, to a low of 53% for a law that would vary the number of
     immigrants the U.S. lets into the country, depending on economic
     conditions.

   The single most popular provision -- a pathway to citizenship for
   undocumented immigrants -- is the one thing congressional Republicans
   say they oppose most. Indeed, some, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas),
   have characterized this element as the one thing Democrats [4]need to
   give up on in order to get a deal done, as if the citizenship provision
   were some superfluous add-on, instead of the point of the endeavor.

   But seeing the lopsided results -- 87% of Americans don't agree on
   much, but they support the pathway to citizenship -- got me thinking
   about the larger dynamic of Congress ignoring public opinion.

   In theory, this isn't supposed to happen. Indeed, political scientists
   have spent years explaining how, in democracies, the policymaking
   process should generally reflect the attitudes of the electorate's
   mainstream -- Americans have policy preferences, they elect like-minded
   candidates to pursue those preferences, and there's an expectation that
   those preferences will manifest themselves in legislative outcomes.

   Politicians have an incentive to generally honor, or at least consider,
   the will of the electorate, fearing a public backlash if they
   consistently go the other way. And as a consequence, most of the time,
   we would expect to see most U.S. legislators making a concerted effort
   to do what Americans want them to do.

   But all of this seems to have broken down quite a bit lately.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Immigration certainly offers a timely example -- 87% of Americans
   support a pathway to citizenship, but most Republicans reject the idea
   anyway, and don't much care what the voting mainstream prefers.

   But this seems to come up quite a bit, doesn't it? During the fight
   over reducing gun violence, more than 90% of Americans supported
   expanding background checks on firearm purchases, and wanted Congress
   to support a bipartisan plan to do just that. Republicans killed it
   anyway.

   During the budget fight, most Americans supported a balanced
   deficit-reduction plan that included tax increases on the wealthy, but
   Republicans didn't care. When President Obama unveiled the American
   Jobs Act, most Americans backed its provisions, but Republicans didn't
   care. Americans like the idea of the Buffett Rule, ending tax subsidies
   to oil companies, and leaving Medicare intact, but for congressional
   Republicans, it just doesn't much matter.

   Now, I should note that the public is sometimes wrong, and Americans'
   attitudes are occasionally contradictory, so there's no credible
   expectation that policymakers will always put aside their own judgment
   to do what's popular.

   That said, it amazes me to see the extent to which congressional
   Republicans have come to believe the polls are simply irrelevant. When
   there's pending legislation, and they're confronted with public-opinion
   surveys showing 9 out of 10 Americans backing a specific course of
   action, GOP lawmakers have no qualms about simply ignoring those
   wishes.

   Is it any wonder the party is deeply unpopular?

   As for why Republicans ignore the polls with impunity, there are
   competing schools of thought, but I'm inclined to believe it has a lot
   to do with the way in which the literal electoral lines are drawn --
   GOP lawmakers are confident that attitudes in their red states and
   districts don't reflect national trends, so they couldn't care less
   what Americans in generally believe, so long as the folks who turn out
   for them on Election Day think the way they do.

   The polls are "relevent" to Republicans when they show Obamacare as
   "unpopular". Of course the reason is that the ACA did not go far
   enough, but those are just pesky details easily ignored. In the larger
   picture the resistance to public opinion is shovels of dirt on the
   grave, enough of those you get buried...

   Republicans only believe the polls that show what they want to believe.
   Witness the 2012 election. Also remember that around the same
   percentage want universal background checks for gun purchases, but that
   will never happen either with these republican clowns in government.

   I would also hazard to guess that a very small percentage of people
   want trans-vaginal ultrasounds, but has that stopped them from being
   required either?

   Republicans do not govern to the majority. The govern to their base.

   Very true!

   90 percent of the population may want background checks on gun
   purchases, and 87 percent may want a path to citizenship for the
   illegals already here. But since 90 percent of the population can't
   vote in a Senatorial election, then why should they care, especially in
   the Red states?

   So in a Red state, especially a southern red state, as long as the
   hicks, racists, paste eaters, knuckle draggers, and people out of touch
   with reality continue to vote for Republicans in their gerrymandered
   districts, the rest of the population can kick rocks as far as they are
   concerned.

   Which is exactly why we need to fire all the Democratic consultants who
   share this belief. The Democratic party needs to go into each
   Republican district and challenge the incumbent. We might not win all
   of them, but we only need to win 25-30 to change America. At the very
   least the Republicans will have to run to the middle to stay in office.

   The first thing we do is fire the Democratic consultants whose minds
   frozen with the belief that the above quote is written in stone.
   Democrats have no choice. We have to challenge conventional wisdom.
   Otherwise, we suffer another two years of this crap.

   That they were Republican wolves, in Democratic union-made wool suits -

   I disagree. It's not that we need to get rid of the "Democratic
   consultants". It's that we need to find or create one or more groups
   who will hire independent, non-Democratic consultants, unbeholden to
   either party, who will advocate for the now-largest portion of the
   electorate--independents not affiliated with either party.

   We need these group(s) to form their own think tanks to do the
   much-maligned "reality-based" research, to mobilize independents to get
   out and register to vote in the primaries of whichever party they hate
   the most, and then VOTE, in the primaries, for sane candidates.

   So long as both parties are selecting their general election candidates
   through primaries that are only voted in by either-party zealots, we
   are going to be faced with neverending choices in general elections
   between Idiot A and Idiot B.

   Those of us who favor reasonable, responsive, well-balanced government
   need to launch and fund a get-out-the-sane-vote campaign that's aimed
   at the primaries.

   We need to grab both parties by the scruff of the neck, and make them
   choose between moderation and oblivion.

   Garden Lady- I think you are overlooking the fact that there really
   aren't than many independent voters. I would call them "unaffiliated"
   instead. They choose not to register with either party. Here in
   Arizona, these unaffiliated voters are about 1/3 of the electorate, but
   they identify and vote along party lines.

   I don't agree that "both sides do it". Look at the number of extremists
   on the right and then tell me we have as many, or as crazy, extremists
   on the left.

   I agree with c u n d gulag that we have to go after every seat,
   including state offices. There are far too many positions where there
   is no opposing candidate. When we allow so many seats to be
   unchallenged, we allow for a concentration of money in the few seats
   that are in swing districts. By forcing every candidate to defend his
   own turf, you also force candidates to moderate their approaches, as
   they will have to appeal to more people to retain their position.

   87% of Americans are for this. Doesn't it naturally follow that the

   At the same time, you get the same people who are for this re-electing
   the GOP cretins.

   I'm especially surprised at their opposition considering that most
   businesses are for this.

   Of course if we were talking about immigration of old, white, men into

   I am just totally dismayed at the heartlessness of these Republicans.
   Allowing these people to become citizens is the only practical and
   humane thing to do.

   They will use border security as their excuse. If we have a moat of
   hot, bubbling lava as a border, they will not see it as secure. It is
   just a ruse for being cruel to immigrants who are living a shadow
   existence, and who should be able to live, work, and pay taxes like the
   rest of us. These are not criminals, but average people who simply want
   to work and live in peace.

   Shame on Ted Cruz most of all. Send him back to Cuba. See how he likes
   being put out to a strange country after living here 40 years.

   India- A moat of hot bubbling lava would never work, anyway. How far
   would that have to extend into the Pacific or the Gulf of Mexico before
   it cooled off? The hardest part for any illegal is just getting across
   the border. It's relatively easy to disappear once you're here. Come by
   boat, by plane, by car. Get a passport, say you're visiting, or
   shopping, or something. Come in through Canada. Unless you've got a
   criminal record or are carrying drugs (or maybe you've got all your
   possessions in a U-Haul), you really shouldn't have much trouble
   getting into the US, and doing it perfectly legally. It's what you do
   once you're here that makes you an undocumented immigrant.

   As far as I know, the US still recognizes passports from other
   countries, including Mexico. Periodically we restrict people from
   certain countries, like Iran or Cuba, from entering the US. To my
   knowledge we have never done that with Mexico. It's not surprising that
   people from a very poor country look at a very rich country right next
   door, and say "why not go there?".

   It's way past time to overhaul our immigration policies. They just
   don't work. They're unfair, discriminatory, create broken families,
   cost vast sums of money better spent on education, and they do far more
   harm than good.

   I sincerely believe that is the primary issue at hand. Politicians in
   general and GOTP candidates especially have to be concerned with
   keeping just a couple of really rich people happy. The ability to spend
   more, particularly at the local level, is a huge advantage that is
   difficult to overcome.

   The problem is that the financiers for the GOTP don't want competent
   politicians in office. People who know what they are doing might, on
   occasion, refuse to go along with particularly damaging policy that the
   rich donor wants because he can benefit by it even while it screws the
   public.

   When they realize that they are being duped and led into the voting

   People, the modern computer has made it much much easier to accurately
   draw election district lines to get just the percentages of Repub and
   Dem voters that you want.

   This is one reason why it will be NECESSARY to pass a Constitutional
   Amendment to make Gerrymandering a crime. Another is -- all the vote
   should have equal weight. Any scheme to make some votes better than
   others is unAmerican.

   Someday soon the youth vote and the minority vote will make

   the lessons we have (or should have) learned in the 200+ year history

   Equal rights for women, no Gerrymandering, money is not speech,
   Corporations are not people, the 1st duty of all Companies is to the
   "good of the American people", it is not OK for "the Press" to tell
   lies to the American people and call it News, it is OK for the Fed.

   The break between House members and popular opinion is a symptom of our
   elections being won or lost on the basis of fund raising instead of
   actually working to make ones district a better place.

   Currently congressional elections are won by the candidate spending the
   most money over 90% of the time. If we control for wackos (e.g. those
   advocating violence, such as Ms. Angle of Nevada, or having to deny
   being a witch such as Ms. O'Donnel of Delaware, or any male candidate
   that mentions rape) and only compare races with viable candidates,
   outspending ones opponent essentially guarantees victory.

   As long as our system selects those pandering to the donor class the
   only polls that will matter will be fundraising pledges from the donor
   class.

   Apparently the donor class wants cheap nannies, gardeners, to break
   unions, and to depress the wages of those who work for a living. Do not
   be surprised when their minions in Congress vote accordingly.

   During the 2012 campaign, the Democratic Party targetted Nevada (hardly
   a liberal bastion and then experiencing the highest unemployment in the
   nation) with volunteers, particularly from California. Months prior to
   the state caucus, they did California-to-Nevada phonebanks and
   encouraged carpools of volunteers to register voters. The RNC ignored
   the warnings of the state chair and thought they could overcome by
   "carpet bombing" the state with money and ad buys. Instead, they didn't
   have enough volunteers to man all the caucus locations and the state
   chair resigned in frustration.

   So: money doesn't always determine success (but it doesn't hurt !)

   I've been posting the same response to all these issues. We need people
   to vote.

   Republicans know they can get re-elected in their safe districts so why
   bother with issues that has National support?

   Not that the Democrats are any better when it comes to safe election
   districts, but in the case of the Republicans they know they can easily
   walk into the next election without a single concern.

   We are working on the assumption that money buys elections. It doesn't.
   Money buys momentum - or the appearance of it. Voter apathy is more
   powerful than voter turnout. No voters actually receive a check for
   turning out at the polls.

   All too many voters just sit on the sidelines leaving the rest of us to
   watch in frustration as issue after issue goes unaddressed because
   voters fail to flex their power and show up at the polls.

   It is a disgrace that we have only 30% to 50% show up at off-year
   elections.

   If we increase the number of voters it will upset the order of
   incumbents winning races for no reason other than being already in
   office. It will also make House Members take the greater opinion of
   likely voters more seriously.

   Clearly today they know that they do not have to do anything to win the
   next election.

   We have reached the point where a "potted plant" can be elected to
   office if they are in the majority of the reliable voters in any given
   district.

   Money may not buy votes, but it does buy research. As someone who works
   in cartography, not for political purposes but for city planning use, I
   have a goodly knowledge of this. Gerrymandering districts has become so
   easy to do, street by street and block by block, that it's practical to
   gerrymander even state assembly districts--hence the takeover of
   statehouses by far, far right tea partiers.

   The hardware and software is cheap and easily available. The cost lies
   in the purchase of the data to crank through the programs. Money does
   buy THAT, and has been buying it in spades.

   I'm not a big fan of constitutional amendments, but I'm about ready for
   one that requires Federal legislative districts to be drawn exclusively
   on the basis of population, geographical compactness, and natural
   geographical boundaries, and specifically banning the use of any
   demographic, socioeconomic or voting data or any similar data.

   Alas, both parties will oppose this.

   I think the media's both-sides-do-it-ism goes a long way to protect the
   GOP from the consequences of their radicalism.

   If voters don't realize the GOP is much more radical to the right than
   the Dems are to the left - let alone aware that the Dems have
   effectively become a party of the center, with practically nobody out
   on the left - they're not likely to factor it into their voting.

   The truth is that immigration is not enough of a motivating factor to
   get people in favor off their butts and out to the polls. It is highly
   motivational for people who are vehemently against it like tea party
   members. This will more than likely show in the midterms which almost
   always has a low turnout. There are those in favor of immigration who
   will say oh well I dont need to vote if it happens it happens if it
   doesnt it doesnt. I would hope voter apathy changes in 2014 midterms
   but I'm very skeptical, I've seen it happen to many times.

   There is so much negotiation and compromising currently going on with
   this issue, and all of it seems to be in order to placate
   conservatives.

   I wonder when it is that so much has been compromised away, that
   Democrats begin to walk away from it, because to vote for such a
   watered down version may assuage Republicans only to anger Hispanics.

   Adding border security without cow dung "triggers" is not going to
   alienate Hispanics. Yes, you are correct that enough is enough with
   larding this down, but this is a no-brainer that will allow hopefully
   enough Republicans to get it passed.

   A correction to this posting...

     ...GOP lawmakers are confident that attitudes in their red states
     and districts don't reflect national trends, so they couldn't care
     less what Americans in generally believe, so long as the [DEL: folks
     :DEL] fools who turn out for them on Election Day think the way they
     do.

   As opposed to dumbocraps like Joe Donnelly from the Mississippi of the
   Midwest (aka Indiana) who has submitted legislation that would make
   'Obamacare' only apply to 'full time' workers (40 hours worked per
   week).

   Republicans are increasingly desperate to portray an image of concern,
   however insincere, for the plight of illegal immigrants. While their
   attempts are laughable at best, I think this is an excellent
   opportunity for Democrats to use some of the same obstructionist
   tactics employed by Republicans. By keeping any immigration reform
   D.O.A., and using the media to place the blame squarely on the sloped
   shoulders of the party of We Hate the Black President, Democrats can
   then come to the rescue and pass legislation in a mid-term elected,
   Democratic controlled, House and Senate before the 2016 election cycle.
   Sometimes it's fun to beat them at their own game.

   The GOP sees everything through the lens of political gain. Will it
   hurt them or help them?
    1. Gun legislation: NRA said kill it so they did
    2. Taxes on the wealthy: Wealthy donors said kill it so they did
    3. Jobs Act: GOP doesn't want the economy to get better so they can
       blame Democrats during next election
    4. Ending tax subsidies for oil companies: Oil companies said kill it
       so they did
    5. Medicare: Wealthy donors are against it because they put more into
       the program than they take out. Privatizing Medicare would make it
       a juicy target
    6. Immigration: helps to many potential future Democrats so the GOP is
       against it

   Note that in all of these examples, the GOP doesn't care how these
   issues help/hurt Americans in general. They care more about their own
   backsides than they do about us. "I got mine, F*CK YOU!"

   Here we go again, have aliens taken their common sense from their
   brain. This is not rocket science. Okay, if you do not want to be
   citizens, when are you going to deport them. This affects their rich
   friends who use illegal aliens for their servents. Now let us think
   about this. As illegal aliens these people do not pay taxes, however
   use our medical services for free and government assistance, of which
   citizens have a hard time getting. Now if we made them legal citizens,
   this would increase the government income and decrease the government
   assistance, unless the rich perfer to pay them under the table.

   It would cost over $190 billion dollars to deport all 11 million
   undocumented immigrants, even if it were possible. I agree that we
   should work towards a pathway to citizenship (for those that want US
   citizenship). But I disagree with you on a couple of things.

   First, most UI's pay taxes. Employers deduct SS and Income taxes from
   their paychecks because it's the law. This amounts to tens of billions
   of dollars every year that end up, unclaimed, in the US Treasury. In
   addition, they pay the same sales and property taxes the rest of us
   pay. They also buy food, products, services, all of which pay taxes and
   employ people.

   Most UI's only go to the doctor when absolutely necessary, because it's
   hard to get and afford insurance. Virtually every state in the union
   denies free services and governmental assistance to UI's. You can't get
   on Medicaid if you are a UI. No Social Security. In most places you
   can't even get a driver's license. Personally, I'd rather make them all
   get DL's, because it would make the roads a lot safer.

   Right now UI's have no bargaining power. Employers, particularly those
   who knowingly hire UI's, literally control their lives, as the UI's
   fear being turned in and deported. Remove that barrier, and you remove
   the means to keep them as virtual slaves. Then, just as you say, wages
   will rise and more taxes will be collected, which raises all boats.

   I believe the thing that Steve Barnes is not considering is that in
   fact the Republicans are representing PEOPLE (as defined by Citizens
   United ruling). The fact that voters number in 87% is irrelevant if 90%
   of corporate backers (other people) of the politician wish that he/she
   votes the other way.

   Making Corporations "people" has made individual American voters
   completely and utterly irrelevant.

   What is the worst humanity can do? How would it be ranked, on a scale
   beginning with Cain and Abel and unending, unmentionable genocides? How
   would this scale be portrayed, viewable and understandable to a public
   that does not want to view it and does not want to understand it? Where
   in the world of ancient words is this plague mentioned?

   The blindness - 'public that does not want to view it and does not want
   to understand'.

   The -horrible- - 'portrayed, viewable and understandable to a public'.

   If you believe in humanity, or if you believe in the gifts of GOD, or
   are consumed by infinite hate, then who would be your leader?

   > > > > Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and the rest of Tea Party...

   Pick a topic and apply 'infinite hatred', and have the key to every
   republican, libertarian, conservative, right-wing, and this results in
   the unreasonable.

   Topic 'The American Dream' All born on this soil are granted citizen by
   the government. These citizens will be free to work independently, to
   settle disputes of property, and paternity with their neighbors. These
   citizens may by vote elect those who will best represent their
   community, and those representatives would provide ardent support for
   their elective community by assessing judging discussing with other
   representatives on issue affecting both. While in good representative
   hands the citizens are freer to busy their hands to attend to
   prosperity. It is the American Dream to come here to better yourself,
   your children, and the society you live and contribute to all the
   things that cannot be taken away from you.

   The US grew from colonial rule of three million to one hundred times
   that, but today this has become clouded. The progress gained by the use
   energies denied human for millennia, has produced abundance, freedom
   and many changes, but these are all threatened by the same power that
   allowed them to happen. Freedom threatened by freedom, is a reversal
   that we are not prepared to fight against, it is the energy abundantly
   used that now has come to remove that freedom.

   The first freedom loss is of movement, not movement itself, but of the
   enslavement caused by the necessity to move from place to place.

   But the most freedom was lost, or given up, by the voter. The voter
   made too busy with the trinkets of prosperity, whose time is seldom
   spent to view the politics of decay. At one time the voter elected the
   best among them to represent all of them. It is an 'All for one and one
   for all' representative form of democracy that works. Whereas today the
   vote is largely wasted, voters vote for only those who have been
   selected by others, appointed by persons of wealth, funded by anonymous
   donors. If we opt to vote for those who are placed before us, we cannot
   be selecting the best among us; there is no candidate that has been
   appointed by the owner of great wealth who has proven to be anything
   but the servant to that wealth.

   The very foundation of the nation has been sold to the wealthy; where
   is the representative government design by citizens to elect by vote?
   Those who will best represent their community and those representatives
   would provide ardent support for their whole of the elective community
   by assessing, judging, discussing with other representatives on issue
   affecting both.

   The 'American Dream' but for who? The fantasy world does not exist, but
   it still useful to think about. Suppose a whole new set of people were
   to dream the American dream. It was widely advertised long before mass
   communications. Many were inspire from around the world, just on rumor,
   to move from home they'd known for centuries, to risk everything, leave
   all behind, and to go to new place where they would have to work harder
   than the every new how, and come to live the American Dream. If every
   born unchallenged American, had to leave all behind, forgo comfort, and
   possible work with blustered hands and move to strange place, few if
   any would take the challenge. Those same unchallenged American would
   connive, distort, disparage erect barriers, add conditions, and install
   fences and do all manner of things to themselves and to the world
   around them to stop the American Dream from spreading. The extremist is
   an unchallenged American, is exactly like, those left behind, in the
   old country who did not want to change, were discouraged by work but
   willing to live under unreasonable unelected governance is a system
   where exploiter alone rose to the heights of power.

   There is more than one America, one of people who dream and work toward
   the American dream, and others who for reasons or infinite hatred
   believe that the American Dream magnificent but empty monument on some
   hill somewhere and that all we have to do is stay in the same place and
   do nothing enough and just move into that future with no work at all.

   The Tea Party may purchase the news of the day all day, but they cannot
   ever be more than the hired help, to white wash the American Dream,
   never to seen again. Tea Party power is the power of infinite hate.

   The outcome is clear and it certain, if all we do is focus on the
   unnecessary when we will have time to do the necessary, when shall we
   able work productively again?

   The immigration issue is 100% our fault, but we deny 100% of the
   responsibility and are determining to do 100% nothing.

   districts don't reflect national trends, so they couldn't care less
   what Americans in generally believe, so long as the folks who turn out
   for them on Election Day think the way they do.

   It's even more limited than that. They are confident that their red
   districts will vote them in... but they really fear the activist base
   that is the other 15%. If they don't keep them happy, they lose in the
   primary and never get to the point where the 90% actually matter.

   The only way to stop this is to break the confidence that the red
   districts will continue to vote for the Republican label regardless of
   who the candidate is, and the only way to do that is to reach out and
   force the conversation in every district across the country. And that
   is a very hard reach in this day of echo chambers and personalized
   news, where the voter never has to hear the other side if they don't
   want to.
