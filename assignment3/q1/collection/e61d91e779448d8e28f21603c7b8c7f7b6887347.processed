[1190]AC360 411: George Zimmerman Trial

   The defense rested Wednesday afternoon in the [1191]George Zimmerman
   trial shortly after he told the court he would not take the stand.
   Zimmerman decided he would not testify in his own defense in the
   shooting death of [1192]Trayvon Martin. The state may or may not call a
   witness in their rebuttal phase, as prosecutors try to prove beyond a
   reasonable doubt that Zimmerman is guilty of second-degree murder in
   the killing of Martin. Zimmerman claims the shooting was in
   self-defense.

   The shooting happened after the teenager and neighborhood watch
   volunteer had an altercation in February 2012. Much of the testimony
   has centered around whether it's Zimmerman or Martin screaming for help
   in the background of one of the 911 calls from the night of the
   shooting. Several witnesses for the defense have claimed it was
   Zimmerman's voice, while others testified for the prosecution that it
   was Martin's.

   Wednesday night on AC360, Anderson spoke exclusively [1193]with defense
   attorney Mark O'Mara and [1194]Martin family attorney Daryl Parks. Tune
   in each night for in depth coverage of the trial at 8, 10, and 11 p.m.
   ET on CNN.

   6

   innocent of second-degree murder.

   of shooting.
   14
   The number of times you hear "help" or "help me" on one of the 911
   calls over approximately 38 seconds.

       Fascinating hearing from the juror. Thanks. At least we can
       understand more. My question would be why did the juror believe
       George Zimmerman's story? Why didn't she assume, with the
       discrepancies, Zimmerman was lying to save his neck?

       This was a tragedy that did not need to happen. While I believe,
       Zimmerman's story, I also believe Trayvon was spooked and/or upset
       by being followed. Why did he not just go home, and/or call 911? I
       do not believe Zimmerman had his gun out or had intentions of using
       it. Who would attack someone with a gun in their hands? When George
       was on the ground and being beaten, and no one answered his calls
       for help, that's when George probably thought he was out of
       options.

       I fail to understand why Tryvon Martin could not use "stand your
       ground." He was the one attacked by Zimmerman. Zimmerman was the
       one who started the confrontation. I asked my totally white 17 year
       old grandson how he would have felt being followed and approached
       by Zimmerman. "Terrified" was his reply. This is a travesty.

       if it does go to a civil trail can the defense bring in the
       facebook stuff about the fights and asking to get a gun.

       From the time my grandchildren were old enough to understand, I
       have made it clear to them that if they are afraid at any timeand
       feel unsafe, they are to call 911. I listened to all of the
       testimony and did not hear at any time that Trayvon called 911 to
       report someone following him. He certainly had plenty of time and
       opportunity to call 911 if he was afraid. If he was afraid, why did
       he not call 911 for help? It seems to me that he had plenty of time
       to go home or to call 911 for help instead of confronting Zimmerman
       in a hostile way.

       I want to know why Trayvon Martin's stepmother was not called to
       take the stand. She said, in any interview with Anderson Cooper,
       that she raised Trayvon from the age of three.
       July 13, 2013 at 10:21 am |
    7. B Griffin
       If Trayvon was on top, over Zimmerman as they are saying and
       Zimmerman shot him, wouldn't Trayvon have fallen forward on top of
       Zimmerman? Then Zimmerman would have had to roll him off, and
       Trayvon would have then been face up on the ground. In the photos
       Trayvon is face down. What gives?

       it is funny ow in fl they help murders and not the person that was
       killed well martin l king was right injustice any where is a threat

       maybe it is zimmerman screaming for help but faking so that
       everyone would think he's the victom therefore pleading selfdefense
       July 10, 2013 at 10:00 pm |
          + Margit Zoechling
            I think the same. The case looks very constructed to me based
            on just the statement (story) from Zimmermann. Why did this
            powerful armed man shoot Trayvon and not wait for police to
            hand him over. What happened is not self defense it is self
            justice.

       IIf i were the Prosecutor, I'd have these simple questions. What is
       the name of the community watch group George Zimmerman claims to be
       affiliated with? How long has G.Z. been attached with this 'watch
       group'? What training has the Watch group been given? ' If 'Trayvon
       Martin looked suspicious for walking around at night ... Were the
       local police aware of the local watch group, to know of their
       presence at night in that community. So they would not likewise be
       thought of as 'suspicious'. If there are no substantiated answers
       with charters, times & dates of these things... It become the case
       it should have been all along. Out of control vigilante, QUILTY!

   12. Dr. K
       We all know there was a cry for help and less than 3 seconds later
       one man shot the other man and killed him.It is obvious that the
       man who has the gun in his hand and is about to shoot does not need
       to cry for help,this is the one who sees the gun is aimed at him
       that will scream in a panic tone for help.If someone falls to the
       ground as shown in picture the portion of head that hits the ground
       is not where george Zimmerman is showing but much further down on
       the occipital region.I believe
       this is a self inflicted wound.What is happening to the
       prosecution,I could present this case much better
       July 10, 2013 at 8:00 pm |
          + Mary l
            Dr K, I never considered the time between the call for help
            and the shot.. Who would be calling for help as they are
            cocking their gun? Or would it be the other person looking
            down the barrel? I have said since I heard of this murder,
            this was a case of racist, macho, gun toting, vigilante,
            supremacists. This is not the old west.. and even then, they
            didn't believe in shooting an UNARMED man.(or child)

   13. Precious Davis
       Sorry, I misspelled Travyon.
       July 10, 2013 at 6:32 pm |
   14. Precious Davis
       My question is...If Trayvon was on top of Zimmerman, how did he
       cock the gun, which needed two hands to do, and fight Trayvon off
       at the same time? Unless the gun was already cocked and ready to
       fire when Zimmerman got out of his truck to hunt Trayvon down.
       July 10, 2013 at 6:29 pm |
          + joseph bonds
            at just what that man zimmerman did he need 100 years
            July 10, 2013 at 10:18 pm |
   15. Luis
       This was a pure self-defense case
