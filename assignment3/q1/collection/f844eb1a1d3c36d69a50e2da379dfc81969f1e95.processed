   Cleveland (CNN) -- First came the pain -- a decade of torture, torment
   and terror for three captive women and one of their young daughters.

   Now comes the prosecution and -- if there's a conviction -- punishment
   for the man accused of being responsible for their hell.

   Ariel Castro appeared silently in court Thursday, his head down, as he
   was arraigned on four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape,
   accused of holding the women captive in his Cleveland home. Cleveland
   Municipal Court Judge Lauren Moore ordered Castro held on $8 million
   bond -- $2 million for each of the three women and the child born to
   Amanda Berry before they were freed Monday evening.

   Hours later, the top prosecutor in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, announced
   he'd press for more charges -- "for each and every act of sexual
   violence ... each day of kidnapping, every felonious assault (and) all
   his attempted murders."

   Furthermore, Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said he'd try to persuade a
   grand jury to indict the 52-year-old Castro for "aggravated murder" for
   the termination of his captives' pregnancies. He cited a state law that
   a person can be charged with murder -- a conviction that could lead to
   the death penalty in Ohio -- for killing unborn children.

   Disturbing ties between Castro and victims
   Kidnapping victim's aunt: God heard us
   Officer reflects on Castro encounter

   [45]CNN Exclusive: 'We don't have monster in our blood'

   According to an initial incident report obtained by CNN, Michelle
   Knight said she became pregnant at least five times while in
   [46]Castro's 1,400-square-foot home. When that happened, she told
   investigators, Castro "starved her for at least two weeks, then he
   repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried."

   It is not known how many times, if any, the other two women got
   pregnant only to miscarry. One of them, Berry, gave birth to a daughter
   while in captivity.

   That's just one of the brutal tales reported so far about the women's
   captivity, which McGinty described as "beyond comprehension."

   "The child kidnapper operated a torture chamber and private prison in
   the heart of the city," he told reporters. "The horrific brutality and
   torture that the victims endured for a decade is beyond comprehension."

   Castro's own mother is among those trying to make sense of the horror.

   "I have a sick son who has done something serious," she told Univision
   and Telemundo. "I'm suffering very much. I ask for forgiveness from
   those mothers; may those girls forgive me."

   Source: Writings detail actions, reasons behind them

   So what was going through the suspect's mind, when he allegedly lured
   three women into a car between 2002 and 2004, took them to his home
   three miles away and held them there -- where they were chained,
   threatened and repeatedly sexually assaulted?

   Neither Castro, his attorneys nor police have spelled out a motive
   publicly.

   The suspect has talked with investigators, confessing to some of the
   actions of which he's accused, said a law enforcement source closely
   involved with the investigation. The source did not describe precisely
   what Castro confessed to when he was interrogated.

   Plus, investigators have asked the state crime lab to expedite tests to
   create a DNA profile of Castro -- something that typically takes 20
   days, but should be back Friday -- said Ohio Attorney General's office
   spokesman Dan Tierney.

   They're also poring over evidence, including more than 200 items seized
   from Castro's Seymour Avenue home. Among them are writings authorities
   believe were written by the suspect, said two law enforcement sources
   closely involved in the case.

   Those contain "specific detailing of actions and reasons behind
   actions" tied to the women's abduction and their kidnapper's behavior
   toward them, one of the law enforcement sources said. The author cites
   his own history of abuse by family members as justification.

   [47]The latest developments in the Cleveland case

   The source -- who described the "pretty lengthy" writings as "more of a
   diary" -- said they included talk of suicide, though that's just one of
   many aspects.

   Authorities are working "meticulously" to see whether others were
   involved in the kidnapping plot. Two of Castro's brothers, Pedro and
   Onil, were initially arrested in the case only to be released Thursday
   -- after appearing in court on unrelated cases -- when investigators
   found nothing, including from the victims' interviews, linking them to
   the abductions.

   One of his daughters, Angie Gregg, told CNN that she "just wanted to
   die" upon hearing her father had been implicated.

   But looking back, she thinks there were signs of something awry -- such
   as how her father "kept his house locked down so tight" and would
   sometimes leave mysteriously for an hour or so, then return, with "no
   explanation."

   "Everything's making sense now," Gregg said. "It's all adding up, and
   I'm just disgusted."

   Source: Death threat if newborn died

   According to the initial incident report, the women said Castro first
   chained them in the basement but later let them live upstairs on the
   second floor.

   The women went outside only twice during their ordeal -- and just
   "briefly" at that, Cleveland Public Safety Director Martin Flask said.

   Most of the time the three would be in different rooms, though they
   interacted occasionally and came to "rely on each other for survival,"
   said a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the
   investigation.

   One thing they could count on was that their alleged captor wouldn't
   let them out.

   Castro would often test his captives by pretending to leave, the law
   enforcement source said. Then he'd suddenly return; if there were
   indications any of the women had moved, they'd be disciplined.

   [48]Survival the key difference from 'House of Horrors' case

   While Knight told investigators Castro forced her to miscarry her own
   unborn children, she said he ordered her to deliver Berry's child,
   according to a police source familiar with the investigation.

   The baby was delivered in a plastic tub or pool in order to contain the
   afterbirth and amniotic fluid, the source said.

   Panic ensued soon after. The child stopped breathing, and everyone
   started screaming, the source said, citing accounts by the young women.

   Knight said Castro threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive,
   the initial police report states.

   "What's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about
   childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy
   6-year-old," the source said.

   Mom: Hope is hard to hold onto

   'I don't think she would have lived very much longer'

   Knight remained hospitalized in good condition Thursday, said
   MetroHealth Medical Center spokeswoman Tina Shaerban-Arundel.

   The others held -- Berry, her 6-year-old daughter and Georgina "Gina"
   DeJesus -- are back with relatives.

   FBI specialists who talked with them feel they "desperately need space
   and time," said McGinty.

   [49]Who are Berry, DeJesus and Knight?

   "These victims need to be decompressed," he said. "They need a chance
   to heal before we seek further in-depth evidence from them."

   Those close to them, as well as residents of Cleveland and beyond, are
   trying to make sense of the alleged depravity.

   One of them is Arlene Castro, the suspect's daughter and once a very
   good friend of DeJesus. She was interviewed on an "America's Most
   Wanted" segment in 2005 talking about how she'd been with DeJesus,
   hoping to spend the afternoon with her, shortly before her abduction.

   Speaking Thursday on ABC's "Good Morning America," she said she last
   spoke with her father late last month, adding the two had never been
   close. Whatever their relationship, she insisted, "I had no idea" what
   was happening.

   "I'm really disappointed, embarrassed, mainly devastated," Arlene
   Castro said. "... I would like to say that I'm absolutely so, so
   sorry."

   [50]Women crushed by news her father allegedly abducted her friend

   Fern Gentry said on CNN's "Starting Point" Thursday that hearing Berry,
   her granddaughter, was alive 10 years after her disappearance was the
   "most important thing that ever happened in my life."

   Gentry, who spoke to Berry by phone from her Tennessee home Tuesday,
   said she's grateful for all involved in the case -- from police to
   helpful neighbors -- and that her granddaughter can now live her life.

   "If she hadn't got out, I don't think she would have lived very much
   longer," Gentry said.
