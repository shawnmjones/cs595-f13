[22]The GOP's catch-22, continued

   U.S. Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator Rick
   Santorum addresses his Michigan primary night rally in Grand Rapids,
   Michigan, February 28, 2012. &nbsp;REUTERS/Jim Young (UNITED STATES
   &nbsp;- Tags: POLITICS ELECTIONS)
   In [29]2012, 72 percent of Mitt Romney's support came from opponents of
   marriage equality, 59 percent came from people who think abortion
   should illegal, and 43 percent came from evangelical whites. To put it
   another way, [30]the GOP ain't changing:

     "Look, the Republican Party isn't going to change," former Sen. Rick
     Santorum said in an interview. "If we do change, we'll be the Whig
     Party."

     Santorum continued: "We're not the Libertarian Party, we're the
     Republican Party."

   It's pretty hard to argue with that: As the numbers make clear,
   Republicans can't win without the Christian Right. The problem is,
   they're still having trouble winning. So Republicans should spend more
   time talking about economic policy and less time on social policy,
   right?

     "If we gave our voters an accurate portrayal of our ideas, that we
     want to cut the rate of growth on Social Security, give tax cuts to
     billionaires and then the values issues, the values issues would be
     more popular than the economic agenda of the current Republican
     Party," said [social conservative leader Gary] Bauer, citing
     particularly those Mass-attending Roman Catholics who have fled the
     Democrats.

     Bauer added, "I would caution the donor wing of the Republican Party
     that is driving a lot of this: If they think social conservatives
     are the only thing preventing Republicans from winning, they'll
     learn that their economic agenda will go down the tubes along with
     the Republican Party's prospects."

   Bauer can whine all he wants about the Koch Brothers' wing of the
   Republican Party, but Bauer needs Koch every bit as much as Koch needs
   Bauer. It's just like Rick Santorum said: if the GOP changes, its
   coalition will disintegrate. But at the same time, the GOP needs to
   change, because its coalition isn't enough to win.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [44]Civil
   Rights, [45]Community, [46]Congress, [47]Culture, [48]Economy,
   [49]Education, [50]Elections, [51]Energy, [52]Environment, [53]Health
   Care, [54]International, [55]Labor, [56]Law, [57]Media, [58]Meta,
   [59]National Security, [60]Science, [61]Transportation, or [62]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([63]California, [64]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Of 12 stories on the front page, 6 are purely GOP-focused.  I think
   that is too much.   A visitor to these pages will of course learn why
   not to vote for or donate to the Republican Party.  What they will not
   learn is why vote for and donate to the Democratic Party and its
   candidates.

   I don't know where the stories can come from, but we need more stories
   showing the benefits of progressive philosophy and programs.

   For me, I want to be able to tell people that the reason why they
   should vote progressive Democrat is always clearly visible with a visit
   to dailykos.com.  Maybe that is an unrealistic expectation of mine?

       And I'm not looking for "why I am a progressive".
       Looking more for achievements - progressives balanced the budget in
       California; or progressives improved schools in Washington;
       progressives reduced gun crime in this community; etc., etc.;  and
       looking for activities - e.g., 212th day of the continued rallies
       outside the Wisconsin state house (or whatever) or brought two
       organizations onto the same stage with agreement to collaborate
       (say a trade union and a NGO) or whatever; or presented petition,
       or etc.
       The "Republicans are idiots" doesn't help build a progressive base;
       it only weakens the Republicans.

   It's difficult to beat an incumbent president, and despite contrary
   analyses, Obama had an improving economy and also got credit for ending
   the Iraq misadventure, among other advantages. Many of the Republican
   senatorial candidates were too wacko to win, but they can conceivably
   find more candidates who hit the sweet spot that can keep the coalition
   together and persuade enough low info voters with their symbolism to
   win elections. (Many more voters still self-identify as conservative
   than as liberal, even if they don't really know what that means in
   policy terms.) The oceans of plutocrat money didn't tip the
   presidential election, but they can have a big impact on congress,
   governorships and state legislatures. The Republicans obviously have
   some tinkering to do, but I'm not decreeing the end of history just
   yet, thank you.

       Any candidate that hits the "sweet-spot" with the electorate is
       going to be torn to pieces by their base and never make it out of
       their primaries. Especially now since they seem to be doubling down
       on their demands that candidates tow the ultra-right wing line.
       Their test for a RINO is anyone that's not spewing the kind of
       thing you hear on Beck or Limbaugh. The harder the money wing of
       their party wants to push someone, the more they dig in their heels
       clamoring for a "true conservative."
       The ones that are crazy enough to make it past their primaries
       makes people shy away from the entire party. That's where our
       advantage is. Keep hanging the lunatic stuff they come up with
       around the necks of all of them. They can't shy away from it since
       the base will turn on them if they do.
       They're clearly not dead yet. But they're wounded and they are
       doing little to stop the bleeding.

   they're stuck with it.  The heart of their agenda has always been the
   economic issues but they've always known  (or should have) that their
   message there is a loser, it benefits too few people.

   That's why the social wedge issues became a useful tool for them.  Now
   they no longer are but they've got nothing to replace them with.  And,
   if they start backing away from the social issues they may just wind up
   with a third party on the right, which would be just fine with me.
   Might be helpful in those gerrymandered districts.

   ran TV ads (at least in my state) with Romney, in his own words, saying
   he wants to overturn Roe v. Wade, and "Planned Parenthood, we're going
   to get rid of that." Obama won the state by 6 points.

   Marriage equality may also be an issue that favors Democrats if not in

   * Anti-LGBTIQ Faction - Add sour milk, 'cause that's all their gonna

   * Santorum fraction - no need to flavour the god party, comes with its

 Real Agenda ([566]0+ / 0-)

   In a way, having the social god-guns-gays-abortion issues at least give
   GOP candidates SOMETHING to talk about.  I mean, how many different
   ways can you say, "Rich people need tax cuts"?

   What are your plans for America?  "Oppose Obama."  OK, it is 2016, he
   can't run again, your plans?  "Cut taxes."  Anything else?  "No."

   What you add by throwing in the social issues is the ability to say,
   "FREEDOM!"  That way the rich hear "freedom from taxes" and the poor
   wing of the party can hear whatever they want to hear.

 They don't even know it, but it's a suicide pact. ([569]1+ / 0-)

   Each bloc of the GOP is going to keep shrieking for the others to stand
   down: Theocrats want Plutocrats to stand down, Plutocrats want
   LiberTeareans to shut the hell up, said LTs don't care about Theocrats'
   social agenda so long as they can cut taxes and keep the brown people
   and women down. But none of them is going to blink: there is too much
   cash and attention at stake for the leaders of these factions for them
   to be willing to take a back seat.

   There is no longer a central organizing principle of this confederacy
   of dunces except to hate Barack Obama.

   It used to be that law-and-order/military defense glued them together
   with flag-waving and knee-jerk God-and-Country patriotism. But nobody
   really believes there is a threat in the world to the US, except debt
   to China. Nobody really believes Iran or South Korea actually threatens
   the US, and all but the nuttiest know our adventures in Central Asia
   have been a disaster that needs to end.

   We've all been saying it for a long time--I first wrote on it [571]last
   July--but the shattering of the Republican Party is here, and pathetic
   efforts at "rebranding" are not going to work.

   On a federal level, this is pretty great for us. But in individual
   states, Republican pursuit of extreme, dangerous right-wing policies is
   a significant threat to the liberty of millions and the ability of the
   country to function.

   I want there to be a Republican Party. Not this mess--but a
   countervailing voice basing its positions somewhat, at least, on
   reality. I sincerely doubt we're going to see it soon. More likely, as
   in the 60s and 70s, the Plutocrats will go where the power is, to the
   Democrats. And we'll have a whole new fight on our hands, once again,
   for the soul of our party.

   If the GOP continues it's journey into stupidity and non-change, the
   Dems will rule this country for a very long time.  And I thank them for
   that.  Bye bye, GOP.  Have a nice trip into ruination and oblivion.
