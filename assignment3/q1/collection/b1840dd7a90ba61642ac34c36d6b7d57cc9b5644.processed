Wisconsin anti-abortion group seeks further regulations

   By Patrick Marley
   Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
   Posted:   11/25/2012 12:01:00 AM CST
   Updated:   11/25/2012 03:17:10 PM CST

   The state's largest anti-abortion group sees opportunities to place
   further regulations on abortion, including requiring women seeking the
   procedure to view an ultrasound of their fetuses.

   Wisconsin Right to Life is also proposing banning abortions that would
   cause pain to the fetus, barring abortions that are sought based on the
   sex of the fetus and prohibiting the ability of state employees to use
   their state health care plans to get access to abortions.

   "I support all those measures and would gladly be a lead or co-sponsor
   on any of them," said Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc. "Any measure
   to protect life is of the utmost highest priority."

   Requiring ultrasounds and banning certain abortions based on fetal pain
   follow a wave of legislation around the country. Backers of abortion
   say if put into law in Wisconsin, they could prompt lawsuits.

   "These bills represent much of what we're seeing across the country,"
   said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute,
   a reproductive health research group that supports abortion rights.

   Abortion opponents were disappointed by President Barack Obama's
   re-election and the ability of Democrats to retain control of the U.S.
   Senate. But Wisconsin Right to Life noted in an email to supporters
   that the election also put all of Wisconsin's state government in the
   hands of Republicans.

   "The silver lining in the November 6 elections is that Wisconsin has a
   right-to-life governor, Scott Walker, and strong right-to-life
   majorities in both houses of the Legislature!" the group's email
   newsletter said.

   As of Sunday, Nov. 25, Walker had yet to weigh in on the specific
   proposals.

   "As you know, Governor Walker is pro-life," Walker spokesman Cullen
   Werwie said in a statement. "With that said, he hasn't gotten a chance
   to meet with Wisconsin Right to Life regarding their agenda or discuss
   it with legislators."

   Sen. Mary Lazich (R-New Berlin) said she backed all four proposals but
   had not decided how she would prioritize them.

   Last session, Lazich worked on a bill that would have required that
   ultrasounds be given to those seeking abortions but she did not
   introduce it. She chalked that up to a lack of time during a tumultuous
   session that saw Senate Democrats leave the state for three weeks in a
   failed attempt to block a GOP plan to limit collective bargaining for
   public workers.

   "Now we've got a little more time," she said of the upcoming session.

   Democrats promised to fight the proposals.

   "They didn't campaign on this," Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Shorewood, said of
   Republicans. "They campaigned on jobs and the economy. ... It's really
   misplaced priorities and it's not what the people from our state or the
   nation are most concerned about."

   Eight states require women seeking abortions to get ultrasounds,
   according to the Guttmacher Institute. Two of those states -- Louisiana
   and Texas -- also require that the ultrasound screen be situated so the
   woman receiving it can view the ultrasound. Additionally, North
   Carolina and Oklahoma have passed similar laws, but they are on hold
   while they are being challenged in court.

   Wisconsin Right to Life has not spelled out its exact proposal, and the
   group's legislative director, Susan Armacost, did not return a call.
   But the brief description of the measure in its email newsletter
   indicated it would go further than any other state by requiring the
   woman seeking the abortion to view the ultrasound. In other states,
   women have the option of looking away.

   Lazich said she has worked with women who regret getting abortions and
   that she believes viewing an ultrasound could dissuade women from going
   through with them.

   Nash, of the Guttmacher Institute, said there is little research on
   whether such laws change women's minds, in part because the laws are so
   new.

   "All of this is about telling a woman she should continue her
   pregnancy," Nash said. "It's really a shaming tactic."

   Ultrasounds are fairly commonly given before abortions, but Nash
   criticized such laws because they require ultrasounds even when they
   aren't medically necessary.

   That can add $50 to $250 to the cost of an abortion. The median cost of
   an abortion in 2008 was $470, according to Guttmacher.

   Many states that have passed such bills have required that the
   ultrasounds be given 24 hours or more in advance. Nash said that can
   create logistical difficulties for women who may need to take another
   day off from work for the clinic appointment.

   Another proposal would ban abortions at around 20 weeks, based on the
   belief by some that fetuses can feel pain at that point. Past court
   rulings have said abortions must be available up to around 24 weeks,
   and fetal pain laws are an attempt to scale back when abortions can be
   provided.

   The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said the
   available science has not shown fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks.
   Abortion opponents, however, point to studies that say they can.

   Nebraska in 2010 was the first state to ban abortions around 20 weeks
   based on fetal pain, and others quickly followed. Georgia has approved
   a similar law that will take effect in January, bringing the number of
   states with such laws in effect to eight, according to Guttmacher.

   A fetal-pain law in Wisconsin would affect an extremely small number of
   abortions because 90 percent of abortions are provided at 12 weeks or
   before, said R. Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the
   University of Wisconsin Law School. Abortions performed at 20 weeks and
   thereafter tend to be ones where serious health problems develop for
   the woman, she said.

   Another proposal would ban women from getting abortions if they were
   doing it because of the child's gender. Sex-selection abortions have
   occurred in countries such as China and have been seen among some
   immigrant communities in the United States, according to Guttmacher.

   Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, said he particularly wants to advance
   the ban on sex-selection abortions because Democrats have accused
   Republicans in recent years of conducting a "war on women." He said
   there was nothing more pro-woman than preventing abortions that are
   sought because of a child's sex.

   "I think as we get more immigrants from other countries we have to be
   particularly attuned to the abortion industry conniving with people to
   reduce the number of women in our society," Grothman said.

   Pasch called Grothman's comment ridiculous.

   "I don't know how to respond to such nonsense," Pasch said. "This isn't
   the first time Sen. Glenn Grothman has proposed or sponsored
   legislation based on nonsense."
