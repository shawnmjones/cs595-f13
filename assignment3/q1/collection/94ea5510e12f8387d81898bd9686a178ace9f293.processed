[22]Open thread for night owls: 'Civil religion' and American exceptionalism

   At Dissent, [29]Michael Kazin writes about the impact of Robert Bellah,
   the sociologist who spotlighted "civil religion" in an influential
   [30]1967 essay:

     Last December, at the prayer vigil in Newtown, Connecticut, Barack
   Obama delivered one of the best speeches of his presidency. He grieved
   and consoled, speaking both as a father and as the head of state. Then,
     pivoting to the need for gun control, he became resolute: "We can't
              tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end."

    Yet the president concluded in an entirely conventional fashion: "May
   God bless and keep those we've lost in His heavenly place. May He grace
    those we still have with His holy comfort. And may He bless and watch
           over this community, and the United States of America."

   The sociologist Robert Bellah, who died on July 31st at the age of 86,
    gave words like that a name--"civil religion"--which he borrowed from
     Rousseau. And he taught us to take them seriously. They expressed,
     argued Bellah in a 1967 essay, "a theme that lies very deep in the
       American tradition, namely the obligation, both collective and
               individual, to carry out God's will on earth."

     Americanism is not simply a creed which nearly every politician and
     many ordinary citizens embrace as fervently as a religion. It draws
      much of its strength, Bellah maintained, from the self-confident
   coupling of the secular and the spiritual. To drive this point home, he
    took examples from two centuries of U.S. history--from "all men...are
   endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights" to Lincoln's
     Second Inaugural, drenched in Biblical phrases, to Lyndon Johnson's
   assertion, in proposing the Voting Rights Act, that God "really favors
                the undertaking that we begin here tonight."

     Talk of "civil religion" has become so familiar in the contemporary
    U.S. that most who use the term probably cannot identify the man who
      initiated it (at least in English). The same is true of "identity
    crisis" and "the invisible hand." Every day, one reads or hears civil
   religion being preached or invoked: in the Pledge of Allegiance and on
   every piece of currency, in debates about placing the Ten Commandments
      on courthouse lawns and walls, and in the ubiquity of "God Bless
   America" on bumper-stickers, in the perorations of political speeches,
                   and during the seventh-inning stretch.

     But attention should be paid to the commonplace. "Bellah founded a
      whole new enterprise for religious studies scholars: probing the
         political significance of religious ideas and the religious
        significance of political ones," his fellow sociologist Mark
        Juergensmayer wrote in an obituary. Any author who probes the
     statements and motivations of Osama Bin-Laden, Glenn Beck, or Sarah
   Palin is indebted to that 1967 essay and to the discussions it sparked
               at academic conferences for well over a decade.

      Today, as those last two examples suggest, the most ardent civil
       religionists tend to be found on the Right. Conservatives view
      religious faith as the cornerstone of American exceptionalism and
   allege that the founders of the republic meant to establish a Christian
      nation. Secular Europeans have been poking away at such religious
    arrogance for a very long time. In 1912, hearing that a Massachusetts
    judge sentenced a labor militant to jail for being "on strike against
    God," George Bernard Shaw jibed, "Delightful. Medieval America always
              in intimate personal confidence of the Almighty."

   But liberals and leftists in the U.S. have frequently embraced the same
   tradition, usually to make the case that protesting the status quo can
         be as legitimate as, and more virtuous than, defending it.
            _____________________________________________________

   [31]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2012--Romney
   reviewed 'several years' of tax returns of VP potentials:

    While Mitt Romney refuses to release his tax returns to the American
   people so they can have the information necessary to evaluate him as a
   presidential candidate, nonetheless, he did demand years of tax returns
     from the persons he considered for the Republican vice presidential
                         nomination. From Buzzfeed:

     Mitt Romney's presidential campaign requested "several" years of tax
     returns from potential vice presidential picks, senior adviser Beth
     Myers, who ran the search, told reporters Saturday. Myers said
     vetting documents were stored in safes in a secure room at campaign
     headquarters for review by attorneys. Asked what was inside the
     safes,Myers replied "tax documents, everything we used." And how
     many years? "Several" she said, declining to provide a more specific
     number.

   Apparently, Romney, like Leona Helmsley, not only thinks that only the
   "little people" pay taxes, but that only "our betters" are permitted to
               review the tax returns of political candidates.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [50]Tagging tips - [51]Search For Tags - [52]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 I e-mailed the Missouri school superintendent ([112]10+ / 0-)

   (Mark Ficken) who was the announcer at the State Fair Rodeo event (the
   one with the rodeo clown wearing the Obama mask) and let him know what
   I thought of him egging on the crowd and mocking President Obama at a
   taxpayer funded event.

   Not surprisingly, Mr. Tough-Guy has already lawyered up.

   Now he's claiming that he's "beleaguered".

     Your concerns are appreciated by my client, however, my client is
     not the individual responsible for making the statements to which
     you have expressed objection.

     A beleaguered school superintendent and president of the Missouri
     Rodeo Cowboy Association, Mark Ficken, has retained legal counsel to
     "set the story straight" relative to the rogue rodeo clown who
     appeared unscripted Saturday at the Missouri State Fair. News
     networks and media outlets have picked up the story which
     erroneously attributed disrespectful commentary to Ficken who was
     serving in his twentieth year as the announcer of the bull riding
     competition at the fair.

     The clown, donning an Obama mask, was wearing a microphone at the
     time of his unscripted appearance. Ficken had no advance knowledge
     of the incident. "He was as surprised as anyone with the appearance
     of an Obama-masked rodeo clown," said Albert S. Watkins, legal
     counsel for Mr. Ficken. Ficken's sole reference to the clown was to
     say, "Watch out for that bull Obama!"

     "Unfortunately, in this day of internet piling on, once an outlet
     published an incorrect statement of facts, the erroneous attribution
     to my client of comments made by a rogue rodeo clown went viral. My
     client is now being inundated by responsive and retaliatory action,
     all of which is premised on a false recital of facts," said Watkins.
     "It is respectfully suggested that the media needs to cut out the
     bull and get the facts straight," added Watkins.

     "My client is a respected member of the community, a responsible
     educator and a man deeply committed to protecting his good name. We
     are closely evaluating the scope and viability of alternative course
     of legal action to remedy the situation," concluded Watkins.

     Very truly yours,

 Intelligence vs religiosity ([145]12+ / 0-)

   [158]http://news.yahoo.com/...

     A team led by Miron Zuckerman of the University of Rochester found
     "a reliable negative relation between intelligence and religiosity"
     in 53 out of 63 studies. Even in extreme old age, intelligent people
     are less likely to believe, the researchers found - and the reasons
     why people with high IQs shun religion may not be as simple as
     previously thought.

     Previous studies have tended to assume that intelligent people
     simply "know better", the researchers write - but the reasons may be
     more complex.

     For instance, intelligent people are more likely to be married, and
     more likely to be successful in life - and this may mean they "need"
     religion less.

     The studies used in Zuckerman's paper included a life-long analysis
     of the beliefs of a group of 1,500 gifted children - those with IQs
     over 135 - in a study which began in 1921 and continues today.

     Even at 75 to 91 years of age, the children from Lewis Terman's
     study scored lower for religiosity than the general population -
     contrary to the widely held belief that people turn to God as they
     age. The researchers noted that data was lacking about religious
     attitudes in old age and say, "Additional research is needed to
     resolve this issue."

   The original team owner [223]George Preston Marshall refused to

   Stadium) in 1961 ... and was told he had to integrate.

   Marshall had some supporters ... and this is one of those surreal
   photos of all time. An American Nazi Party rally (yes, really)
   supporting Marshall had members carrying signs that read "Keep Redskins
   White".

     It sounded like a thunderstorm as windows broke and the ground
     shook, but vacations who were awakened from their rooms at a villa
     near Orlando soon realized that the building was starting to
     collapse -- parts of it swallowed by a 100-foot sinkhole that also
     endangered two neighboring resort buildings.

     By early Monday, nearly a third of the structure at Summer Bay
     Resort had collapsed. All 105 guests staying in the villa were
     evacuated, as were those in the neighboring buildings. No injuries
     were reported.

   in the past and will stand in the foreseeable future), a religious
   perspective is one that can't be completely shut out of the political
   discourse if your goal is to have a Rawlsian overlapping consensus that
   undergirds our political and social institutions so that we have a
   stable foundation upon which to build and sustain our nation.

   Given the level of religiosity among the American people, removing God
   from civil speeches could lead to an inauthentic political experience
   for many people and an alienation between government and the human
   experience.  Including God could lead to a similar effect, but on fewer
   people.  So it may be that God belongs there in some form, for purely
   practical reasons.

       Yes, I know that liberal or social-justice religious people are
       political too.  But "religion in politics" has been used more by
       the right (and by politicians seeking to mollify the right - keep

 not all Christianity the same ([580]0+ / 0-)

   I think one fallacy in this is the idea that the country was founded on
   a monolithic form of Christianity, and when the radical evangelicals,
   who are mostly those pushing this idea, is the flavor of Christianity
   that is that monolithic form.  The evidence suggests otherwise.  The
   founding fathers were Christians, but they did not necessarily all
   believe the same thing.  Thomas Jefferson, for instance, took a knife
   to his bible and cut out the bits he thought were silly.  John Adams
   and John Quincy Adams were of the same ilk.  For instance, while many
   protestant favored the Catholic trinity, some though this was idolatry
   and favored a single deity.

   Jefferson and Adams were instrumental in the writing of the early
   documents of the country.  Jefferson was instrumental in writing the
   constitution of Virginia, which held many basic tenners of the US,
   including the idea of the armed militia.

   The modern evangelical movement did not come about much after the
   formation of the US, partly due to a division in the congregationalists
   churches.  It is said the evangelists became powerful through revivals,
   which the new middle class used as a method to keep control over their
   employees.  In a world no longer based on apprenticeships, where the
   master served in loco parentis, the church was used to guide young
   people to the productive path. Not drinking late.  The focus on
   building a family, not sex.  To the day a hard working person on the
   late shift can't go to a bar.

   So, even if the US is a christian country, the Christianity practiced
   is not that of the general modern population.  It is like saying that
   we should be practicing the Catholicism of the Borges.

     The Civil Religion Today

     In reifying and giving a name to something that, though pervasive
     enough when you look at it, has gone on only semiconsciously, there
     is risk of severely distorting the data.

     Gradually but unmistakably, America is succumbing to that arrogance
     of power which has afflicted, weakened and in some cases destroyed
     great nations in the past.

      _ Robert N. Bellah

   And this nails the problem:

     Above the pyramid on the great seal of the United States it says in
     Latin, "God has favored our undertaking."

   So glad Michael Kazin wrote on this

     Why something so obvious should have escaped serious analytical
     attention is itself an interesting problem.

   From 1967 - something that we really need to revisit and hammer home:
   the Ralph Reeds, Huckabees, Santorums and that fossilized santimonious
   TV preacher with the big ears are the danger and probably account for
   todays societal woes as much as any other single thing.

   From deepwater drilling, endless war making and the "national security
   surveillance" that goes with it, to CEO's siphoning off billions while
   people literally go hungry.

     Serious question for Statists/free market haters:

     Your argument is that in a free market corporations would have
     unchecked powers that will surely, as you claim, lead to evil
     monopolies. My argument is that monopolies can only exist through
     the direct or indirect help of government. My question is, can you
     show me ONE corporation in history (yes, all of human history) that
     has monopolized (Coercive monopolies. Not earned monopolies that can
     be taken out through competition) WITHOUT the help of a state
     apparatus? So far no one who bashes on the free market has been able
     to answer this (should be simple if you were right) question for
     me...Only ONE example is all I ask. Anyone?

   Aside from how monopolies is just one of the issues, and not the issue.

   I've no expertise in debating this topic, but the following come to
   mind:

   (1) Any society in which an incorporation can be recorded necessarily
   has the civil legal structure (i.e., "government") to process and
   uphold the incorporation. Thus, everything any corporation does is
   perforce "with the help of a state apparatus." Is the questioner's
   premise thus as trivial as it looks?

   (2) Oligopolies are every bit as noxious as monopolies, but true
   monopolies are much rarer.  Given what I know of libertarian debate
   technique, the demand that you respond with the name of a true
   monopoly, rather than an oligopoly, is likely no accident.

 At one point, the Dem caucus was at 60 ([720]0+ / 0-)
       Including two independents.  That was just before the 2010
       elections.  So, over the 2010, 2012, and 2014 elections, the
       Democrats would appear to be defending 60 seats.  Since 2010
       involved 19 seats held by non-Republicans and 18 seats held by
       Republicans, 2012 and 2014 combined should involve 41 seats held by
       non-Republicans and 22 seats held by Democrats.
       So, if it seems like Democrats have been defending twice as many
       Senate seats as Republicans, it's because they kind of are, due to
       having once held way more seats than Republicans.  Those numbers
       will reverse in 2016, when only ten out of the 36 Senate seats up
       for grabs are currently held by Democrats.

     Michael Hayden, Bob Schieffer and the media's reverence of national
     security officials
     ------------snip-----------------
     But worse than the omission of Hayden's NSA history is his current -
     and almost always unmentioned - financial stake in the very policies
     he is being invited to defend. Hayden is a partner in the Chertoff
     Group, a private entity that makes more and more money by increasing
     the fear levels of the US public and engineering massive government
     security contracts for their clients. Founded by former Homeland
     Security secretary Michael Chertoff, it's filled with former
     national security state officials who exploit their connections in
     and knowledge of Washington to secure hugely profitable government
     contracts for their clients. As the Huffington Post's Marcus Baram
     reported:

 Syriana - 2005 ([744]0+ / 0-)

   I'm guessing a few late-nite denizens of Kos' esteemed site that I've
   been a willing participant  through even though he won't let me
   retrieve my original user-ID # due to my flirtation with AOL and my
   inability to recall which dog's name at which particular moment I based
   my password on frikkin' AOL but I digress.

   Twenty-three thousand some odd-number.

   47? Something about a car's name or a bird's name and my lucky-number -
   Help me out here AOL.

   I don't know, and it's not important.

   Sometimes stupid-shit takes too much precedence in your head.

   Twenty-three thousand and some goddamn number - C'mon Kos gimme back my
   "SecondComing" monniker/screen name whatever..

   Anyway, back to the movie. I'm watching it for free on the 'Net.

   Well worth the 2 hours, even though it's ancient history.Unless you're
   in the Time-Warp again.

   If that's the case - All bets are off.

   Smile, Fuck-around.

 Granite religion is how I refer ([761]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [762]JeffW

   to civil religion, because it includes semi-deities like Lincoln,
   Washington  & Jefferson, war dead,  Dr. King, a host of American heroes
   & saints. Civil religion bridged the gap between the deist founders,
   Anglicans, later Jewish & Catholics, what became mainline Protestantism
   on one side, &  on the other side Evangelical Protestantism.   These
   two forces have been  fighting over America's "soul" for nearly its
   entire history. Sorry atheists, except for some winning court
   decisions, you've never been allowed  in the fight except as social
   reformers & union organizers.   It is only the past 35-40 years that
   Evangelicals got the upper hand & kept it. We had no "Evangelical"
   president in the 20th Century until Jimmy Carter. The other was Bill
   Clinton. Both Democrats from the South.

   Many American historians of religion argue that the mainline
   Protestantism controlling government, universities, institutions, big
   corporations, banking, the military, gradually abdicated their
   guardianship of civil religion, handing America power & intellectual
   discussion  over  to secularists, which was a great betrayal to
   Evangelicals. It wasn't just Falwell & Moral Majority & a sudden
   change. I largely agree with this assessment. Remember, in the Fifties
   many Southern Evangelicals were condemning & burning Elvis Presley
   records, which must have dismayed the Evangelical Elvis & his many
   friends in both the white & black gospel music scenes - renowned
   singers & quartets.  Evangelicals had always felt out at the edges of
   American power, but they had never fully pluralized, as they do now.

   In my mainstream, white middle class town, expressions of civil
   religion were never over-burdening,  never excessive or emotional,
   always routine & ritual. It was if the Mainline Protestants & the
   Catholics didn't want to offend each other, or the few Jews, or the
   "freethinkers" as we called them. They were  angered by the court
   decision  ending  daily Bible reading & recitation of The Lord's Prayer
   from public schools, but that passed quickly enough. Few students
   cared.

 Never heard the term before... ([765]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [766]JeffW

   ... reading the above snippet [my bold below].

     Talk of "civil religion" has become so familiar in the contemporary
     U.S. that most who use the term probably cannot identify the man who
     initiated it (at least in English).

   Religion is a matter of faith.  "Civil" government plays no role in
   religion - other than granting religions tax-free status, even though
   they don't deserve it because they preach politics from the pulpit most
   of the time.

   Technically, faith doesn't have anything whatsoever to do with
   civil/secular life since the latter has to deal with objective facts
   about all the dry mundane details that one needs to know to run any
   part of local, state, or federal government, and if it's in an
   educational institution, then hard scientific facts and objective
   testing comes into play for research purposes.  That's the part that is
   civil in our lives.

   The problem with modern politics is that politicians, political
   parties, and Moronic Media have allowed religion into politics and they
   are not respecting the separation of church and state.  Many long years
   ago (back to at least 1954 and before when 'under god' was inserted
   into the Pledge of Allegiance because I had a problem entering first
   grade and having to remember to insert those two words in grade school)
   religionists started whining about needing morals in politics and
   government..., and now they have more say-so than ever, thanks to
   Dumbya's 'office of faith-based initiatives' that's run through the
   White House and now Obama runs it.  Birth control pills and abortion
   came into being, and religionists started acting like the world was
   going to end because women were controlling their own bodies by
   limiting the number of children they had one way or another (if they
   weren't brainwashed by clergy).

   If someone brings up separation of church and state (in the First
   Amendment), the religionists start screaming 'they're trying to take
   freedom of speech from us! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!'  [Want some cheese with
   that whine?]

   As long as it was mentioned only in passing occasionally, I could put
   up with politicians doing their closing religious salutations (it's a
   meaningless phrase and no one with an IQ higher than a rock believes
   it), but now that religious "leaders" are on political shows and
   inserting themselves and their misogynistic "wish you'd pass this law
   to keep women at home, barefoot, and pregnant" idiocy because they
   pretend to talk for and on behalf of an invisible being into politics
   and government consistently, it has gotten to be too much.  Whatever
   respect I could have for politicians who listen to religionists and
   take money from them to pass their misogynistic and restrictive
   legislation has evaporated entirely.

   Soooooo.... when can we get back to a total, absolute and enforced
   separation of church and state as mandated in the US Constitution and
   the Bill of Rights???

   I'm sick of attempts to steer this nation from principles evolved in
   The Age of Reason to hallucinations derived from illiterate herdsmen. ~
