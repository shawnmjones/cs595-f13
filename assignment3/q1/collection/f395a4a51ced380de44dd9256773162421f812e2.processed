[22]'America Rising' Super PAC starts their anti-Clinton fundraising efforts

   I'm only surprised it took [29]a whole eight months:

     Pro-Republican Super PAC America Rising is launching a fundraising
     effort today as their answer to the growing tide of support for
     Clinton. The PAC has a brand new site, StopHillary2016.org, a
     one-stop shop for Clinton haters.

     And they're blasting a series of e-mails to randomized groups of
     donors to solicit money for the cause.

   What are our policies? We don't know! Who is our candidate? We don't
   care! All we know is that we're against Hillary Clinton, so send us
   some money already!

   I'm really not looking forward to reliving the ridiculous
   Get-The-Clintons 90s with this new crowd. Newt Gingrich was bad enough.
   Ken Starr was a permanent stain on the national consciousness. I really
   don't want to know what the current crowd, the crowd that convinced
   themselves Barack Obama was a secret Muslim and that the gubbermint is
   hoarding ammunition to start a war against them, would come up with
   next. Oh wait--we already know. Benghazi.

   The PAC freely admits that the goal of the new fundraising effort is to
   test which future strategy could rake in the most money, a "competitive
   advantage"-based plea, a "Clinton Machine"-based plea or a "Clinton
   scandals"-based asked. Pfft, I could answer that for them right now: go
   with the crazy-sounding one. This is the Republican base we're talking
   about; if it ain't batshit crazy, they ain't interested.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [44]Tagging tips - [45]Search For Tags - [46]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   spending now, and all the effort they're going to now, will be wasted,
   and if they're still stubborn enough to do it after the convention,
   it'll be further evidence to the electorate how deranged the GOP is.

   They tortured people to get false confessions to fraudulently justify

   No, not Benghazi... that's small potatoes.  I'm here from Amurika
   Rising to tell you the REAL agenda.

   You see... This new Clinton is a WOMAN.  And you know, women have
   secret women parts, and they can do unnatural things like bleed for
   days without dying, and are apparently controlled by something called
   the Grand High Vulva living on a lunar base.  That's why we need the
   Bible and Jeebus.  But because Hillary is not a proper God-fearing
   woman (i.e., she isn't barefoot, pregnant, and chained to the kitchen
   sink), that means she's one of them feminazis who hates men.  She's
   part of a secret pagan cult that dance in the woods and worship labia
   and stuff, and she's planning a secret war against males and maleness!

   I'm calling it the War on Masculinity!

   If she's elected, men's wrists will start to hang limp within a year.
   Within two, we'll be wearing kicky scarves and talking with lisps and
   won't love our guns any more (or at least we'll paint them pink).  In
   three, the NFL will be banned and women will (gasp) have equal pay for
   equal work, and the biggest jobs provider in America will be Satana's
   Abortionplex.  In four years, all men will be sent to FEMA
   gender-reassignment camps to be surgically altered into women (the
   groundwork for which was laid out in Obamacare), and any who still
   refuse will be castrated and shipped off to Mexico and Kenya to work
   camps.  The lucky ones will weave Muslim prayer rugs, the unlucky will
   work as prostitutes for Muslim drug lords, under their new grand
   poobah, former president Obama (who sits on his throne built of
   scrapped AR-15s and lights Cuban cigars with copies of his phony birth
   certificate).

   That's the Clinton Woman's plan for Amurika.  Won't you give to Amurika
   Rising now?  While you still can...

   First, President Obama was legally adopted by his step-dad Soetoro ( a

   Indonesia, a devout Muslim country. There's all kind of photos all over
   the internet to prove it.
   [236]photo 3kf3mf3oe5Y25U45S1a9k1ccdbc0fe8d016fe.jpg

   Before anybody says anything, I voted for him twice and voted straight
   Democratic my whole life. I have Muslim neighbors here in Philly who I
   talk to and buy from their grocery stores daily. So I'm not against
   them. If he is still a Muslim, why doesn't he just come clean? I mean,
   Muhammed Ali was and still is my hero after he did.

   there are lots of very seriously devout people (myself included) who
   are not following the religion of their childhood

   Politics is like driving. To go backward put it in R. To go forward put
   it in D.

       ...my dad flew 3 combat tours in Vietnam. He converted from
       Christianity to Buddhism. I think it's everyone's right to believe
       or not to believe any way they like. My only point is that we
       should all embrace our heritage and be honest about our beliefs. I
       don't care what Obama believes as long as he doesn't let those
       beliefs interfere with his sworn oath of duty to this nation, our
       people, and as long as he defends the Constitution I have no
       problem. It's just a thought, but it's not a novel one.

     "Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand
     by the president or any other public official, save exactly to the
     degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to
     support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is
     unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by
     inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the
     country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth,
     whether about the president or anyone else."

       ...it really doesn't matter at all what I think. Perception is the
       mother of many sons. And false presumptions can divide any nation
       asunder. I've never said he lied or wasn't honest. If you must tag
       it, call it omission by political expediency. All politicians
       triangulate for maximum political gain. For the sake of discussion
       (and that's all we're doing, not fighting ghosts of battles long
       decided) let's suppose for one second, that deep inside he was
       still Muslim in his heart. Who cares? As long as he serves America
       with all of his heart, that's the most important thing. But you and
       I both know that his enemies would rip him to shreds over it. They
       already have, do, and always will.

 Why can't he be a Christian? ([284]0+ / 0-)

   Because all kids adopt their step parents religion? (They don't)

   Because all kids raised out of the country adopt that country's
   religion? (They don't)

   Because even if those two things were true, and they're not, he can't
   convert to Christianity? (They can)

   What exactly makes you so sure he can't be a Christian, especially when
   he got raked over the coals for having a "radical" Christian preacher?

       ...either the most prescient, wisest man in the kingdom. Or it
       would nullify the separation of church and state. Both concepts are
       false. I'm neither the wisest nor do I presume to know another
       man's thoughts or heart. To paraphrase Patrick Henry, "I have only
       the lamp of experience to guide me". Everything we do and say in
       this life leaves footprints on our psyche, and those around us.
