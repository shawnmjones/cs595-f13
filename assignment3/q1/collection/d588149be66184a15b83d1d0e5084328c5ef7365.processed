     * Today's [29]comic by Jen Sorensen is [30]Color blind:
       [31]Cartoon by Jen Sorensen - Color blind
     * [32]83-year-old Charlie Rangel plans to run in 2014: But the Harlem
       representative, who has been in Congress since 1971, says he will
       make up his mind around October based on "what the community
       decides."
     * [33]Mitch Daniels denies he plagiarized attack on Howard Zinn. The
       president of Purdue University was criticized for his efforts
       revealed in emails when he was governor of Indiana to get the the
       leftist Zinn's writings about U.S. history out of the public
       schools. Now he's being accused of academic dishonesty in his
       response to that criticism:

     English writing experts, a New York journalist and critics of the
     former Indiana governor say a statement Daniels released July 17 in
     the wake of controversy over an Associated Press article contains
     striking similarities to two sources: an article by journalist
     Michael Moynihan published in Reason Magazine in 2010, and a
     Stanford University news release put out in December. [...]

     "Look, if there's anything I do, I write my own stuff," Daniels
     said. "All of it. I always have -- 75,000-word books, speeches,
     everything."
     * [34]North Carolina legislators approve carrying guns in lots more
       places. For holders of concealed carry permits, those places
       include: bars and restaurants that serve alcohol (as long as the
       owner doesn't object); greenways, playgrounds and public recreation
       areas; locked in cars at universities and public schools. The
       lawmakers removed a provision that would have done away with
       background checks and permits by country sheriffs for anyone buying
       a handgun.
     * [35]Six words the White House doesn't want to hear.
       [36][4v17ciyg0erwx6uffdvw_normal.jpeg] Biden at the Bombay Stock
       Exchange in India: "Off script for a second here...."
       -- [37]@jbendery
     * [38]World leaders on Twitter, but they don't use it. Facebook, too:

     President Obama is great at getting Twitter followers -- he has 34.5
     million of them -- but he barely follows any of his international
     counterparts. All told, Obama, the White House and the State
     Department follow a grand total of four world leaders: Russia's
     @medvedevrussiae, Britain's @Number10gov, the Norwegian Prime
     Minister @jensstoltenberg and Chilean President @sebastianpinera.
     What's worse, they never talk to one another online. [...]

     When Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in
     February, a lot of people wondered about the future of the geeky
     program she helped put together to make social media a new
     cornerstone of American diplomacy. Under Clinton, the State
     Department launched countless Twitter profiles and embassy Facebook
     pages, the better to engage with foreign publics.
     But the effort hasn't all gone well. According to an inspector
     general's report, the State Department spent more than $600,000 to
     increase Facebook "likes," buying the kind of achievements that
     public diplomacy is supposed to create organically.
     * [39]Failed candidate Gabriel Gomez would like to take back his
       "pond scum" comment. The Republican opponent of Ed Markey in the
       U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts said: "I let my emotions get the
       better of me." In May, Gomez had said:

     "You know I've got four young kids, and they gotta sit there and
     gotta see an ad with their dad -- who served honorably, talk to
     anybody I served with -- whether as a pilot or as a SEAL, anybody I
     worked with. And for Markey to be as dirty and low, pond scum, like
     to put me up next to bin Laden, he's just gotta be called what he
     is. It's that simple."
     * [40]Two House Democrats introduce ewaste anti-dumping bill:

     U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Gene Green (TX-29) today
     introduced H.R. 2791, "The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act
     (RERA) of 2013," with the promise of stimulating the US recycling
     industry banning e-waste dumping by American firms overseas. E-waste
     is generally defined as electronics equipment or components that can
     create environmental, health, or national security risks when
     disposed of improperly.

     The news comes just after one Colorado firm was ordered to pay over
     $4 million in fines, with two executives sent to prison, for a
     scheme to illegally dispose of and export electronic waste to China
     and other foreign countries.
     * [41]New study says Arctic melting will cost world economy $60
       trillion:

     The release of methane from thawing permafrost beneath the East
     Siberian Sea, off northern Russia, alone comes with an average
     global price tag of $60 trillion in the absence of mitigating action
     -- a figure comparable to the size of the world economy in 2012
     (about $70 trillion). The total cost of Arctic change will be much
     higher.
     * [42]It's not stealing if you are a bank. An Ohio woman came home
       from an out-of-town trip to find the locks on her home changed and,
       after climbing in a window, all her belongings gone. Turns out that
       a bank had broken in, repossessed the place and sold her stuff. But
       the bank had picked the wrong house. She seemed rather reasonable
       under the circumstances, only asking that the bank correct its
       "error" by reimbursing her. But instead of contrition and laying
       out the red carpet and maybe offering to pay for the woman's next
       vacation as well as providing ample restitution, the bank president
       displayed attitude and told her that the $18,000 she requested
       wasn't going to happen. Not going to pay her retail, she says he
       said. "I'm getting attitude from them. They're sarcastic when they
       talk to me. They make it sound like I'm trying to rip the bank off.
       All I want is my stuff back." And the cops? No help on that front.
       They consider the case closed.

       On today's [44]Kagro in the Morning show, Greg Dworkin rounds up
       the latest Nate Silver discussions: math skills, yes, but it's also
       the writing. Also, a new NBC/WSJ poll shows views of race relations
       have taken a serious hit of late. Next, the suddenly exploding
       story of gonzo gun nut police chief Mark Kessler, with Alex
       Seitz-Wald, who looks this whackadoodle in today's Salon. Lots to
       marvel over in that story, and the larger effect of blurring the
       lines around gun issues across the country. Finally, we start
       reading & commenting on Noam Scheiber's "The Last Days of Big Law."

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [55]Tagging tips - [56]Search For Tags - [57]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   should make argument personal. Instead of going after the bank, go

   This is a rant--not against Republican tea party shits, but against
   spineless union leaders and members.  Detroit's retirees are gonna lose
   big time in bankruptcy court--their only hope is with present
   employees--yet no union strikes, threatens to strike, even wonder out
   loud what it could do.  Fuck you--I'm a retired teacher--(NYC, not
   Detroit) and realize all jurisdictions underfund pensions--and all will
   look to this as a convenient precedent.  Come September--all municipal
   employees in Detroit need to strike.  That will fail---because few
   people care about this once great city.
   After a week, all Michigan employees must join the strike--that means
   you police and fire.  After another week--all government employees
   throughout the country.
   This won't happen--less because it's not known to be the only
   recourse--but because we no longer have strong union leadership--and a
   sense of brother/sisterhood.
   Trumka, you are a failure--until workers step up and stop the
   slaughter, Detroit will be Calcutta--then so will Chicago--then
   Cleveland--then 99% of the country.

   Under capitalism, man exploits man. Under communism, it's just the
   opposite. John Kenneth Galbraith .

   Yellen or if all else fails, some random person from the subway is
   picked to be next Fed chair and now Summers or some other "frontrunner"
   from the old-boy network. Even with financial "reform" in 2010,
   Glass-Steagall remains repealed and derivatives are still the same
   unregulated house of cards waiting to tumble as they were in 2007, and
   Lawrence Summers has a lot do with that. Too much Wall Street coziness
   to have anything even pretending to be a functional economic system and
   government.

   [255]1864 House (even got the SN correct this time) about the banking
   industry lobby's attempts to remove the tax exempt status of credit
   unions.
   Banks want (at the very least) payback for the move into credit unions,
   if nothing else. They also don't want fair competition, of course.

   No it will not. It will cost everything. Far more than $60 trillion.

 Where's "stand your ground" when you ([272]0+ / 0-)

   The only thing that will stop banks "dead in their tracks" from
   foreclosing on homes they don't own and then acting all arrogant about
   it, will be when someone gets dropped in the front doorway trying.
