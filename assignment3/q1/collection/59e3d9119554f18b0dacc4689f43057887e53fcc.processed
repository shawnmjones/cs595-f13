[24]Special Prosecutor to Investigate TX Gov Perry for Coercion and

   From The Dallas Morning News:

     A San Antonio senior state district judge confirmed Thursday that he
     will name a special prosecutor to investigate possible charges of
     coercion and abuse of official capacity against Gov. Rick Perry.

     Judge Robert "Bert" Richardson said he expected to name someone
     early next week, at which time "an order will be prepared and filed
     with the court."

     The investigation stems from the governor's veto of $3.7 million
     annual funding of Travis County's Public Integrity Unit.

     Perry acknowledged that he let it be known that if Travis County
     District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, did not resign her
     office following a DWI conviction, that he would cut off funding for
     the integrity unit.

   Oh please give this Special Prosecutor the same flexibility Ken Starr
   enjoyed.

   Nice to see at least a little bit of justice nipping at the heels of
   these execrable Goposaurs.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [46]Tagging tips - [47]Search For Tags - [48]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       didn't Governor Perry call for the resignation of the Kaufman
       County District Attorney who got his second DWI in 2009?  Could it
       be because he was a Republican?

       Yes, Gov. Goodhair should have called for his resignation too, most
       definitely.
       But we should hold ourselves to a higher standard than these guys.
        Seriously, is our standard for behavior what Republican
       Officeholders in Texas do or don't do?  I like to think that we
       hold ourselves (and our elected officials (I'm looking at YOU,
       Weiner)) to a much much higher standard.

       The point is, Perry's demands for her resignation were strictly
       political, so he would be able to replace her with a Republican who
       would then turn a blind eye to his other shenanigans such as his
       involvement with the Cancer Treatment Centers of Texas.  It has
       nothing to do with our side having higher standards.

   case, but DWI can be used for things other than alcohol. DWAI is what
   I've also seen for Driving While Alcohol Impaired to be specific. Being
   impaired and behind the wheel of a multi-thousand pound vehicle is bad
   no matter what the reason and can lead to harm and worse, but I'm not
   sure what the differences are between DWI and DUI.

   Was this case strictly because of Alcohol, or was it perhaps some other
   impairment (medicine, physical limitation, blindness)?

       Driving While Intoxicated. Means alcohol, or arguably other
       (illegal) drugs.
       See, the law hasn't caught up to other nuances...seriously, I think
       other states parse it more.
       Maybe this helps. DWI is the acronym in Texas, but broadly covers a
       number of possible causes.  "DWI per se" means de facto alcohol
       level over 0.08 %.

 DWI vs DUI ([456]0+ / 0-)
       Varies state by state, depending on the language in the
       legislation. DWI is usually explicitly alcohol (Driving While
       Intoxicated); DUI is broader and includes other mind-altering
       substances (Driving Under the Influence).

   The real reason why Perry wants the Travis County DA to resign: if she
   resigns, Rick gets to appoint her replacement.

   This has actually been fairly common practice in the state.  I
   understand that Perry has frequently pressured local elected officials
   of the Republican stripe (i.e. DA's, judges, etc.) to resign midterm
   rather than wait until their term is up and just retire.  That way,
   Perry gets to appoint a replacement to serve until the next election...
   where said replacement gets to run as "the incumbent."  It's his way of
   making sure that only "the right people" serve as prosecutors and
   judges in the state.  (Granted -- he has close to zero control in
   Democratic counties, where even if he does get to appoint somebody,
   they'll just get trounced at the polls, and even in some of the swingy
   areas Republican judges will get bounced at election time.)

       thing in Wisconsin.  Mostly offering cushy 6 figure appointment
       jobs to Democratic members of our Legislature so he can appoint
       their replacement.  And since he's converted a whole lot of Civil
       Service jobs to appointment status (and raised the salary in our
       "broke" state by an average of a third), he's got a lot of
       appointment power.

   if only because he's doing this to elected officials who were going to
   retire anyway, and (usually) Republican elected officials.  It's
   replacing Republicans with more Republicans, but the appointed people
   are Perry's people.  They owe their job to Perry and they know it.

   It ultimately means a lot of people in the state owe their jobs to Rick
   Perry.  That's an underrated part of how he won the 2010 primary.

       complaints. Sometimes we see or suspect that complainants have been
       invented by law enforcement, but, on the whole, Democrats may be at
       a disadvantage in that they aren't mean-spirited enough to
       routinely lodge complaints. Law enforcement relies on informants
       because that's what gets the ball rolling.
       The Cons have made an art out of "not doing" or depriving others of
       what they are entitled to in order to coerce compliance. First of
       all, because coercion is what they are after and, secondly, because
       then they can't be charged with taking bribes.
       Trading favors for favors is wrong (it's why Don Siegelman was sent

   are none too happy with their foolish GOP minions, who are failing to
   do their job and making them look bad with their racism and lack of
   mouth control.  Thus, the occasional Rick Perry is actually addition by
   subtraction.

   Truth is, the huge multi-national oligarchs have gotten so big that
   both Democrats and Republicans are becoming expendable, so the new plan
   is to just kick them both out and put in their own Princes over time.

       The oligarchs do not want to be visibly in charge, which makes
       their game too obvious. (Anyone seen the Koch Brothers on the
       Sunday talk shows recently? Me neither.) Looks to me like they
       prefer having a glib sock-puppet out front doing the talking, as
       long as they're guaranteed the real power to write the laws and
       regulations and dictate policy. That's why GWB was their dream
       President.
       It also looks to me like the oligarchs misjudged -- thought they
       could fund a little astroturfy Tea Party movement and keep it as a
       side advertising campaign to use or withdraw as convenient. But it
       took on a real life of its own, and now they're scrambling to try
       to get control back.

       motivation is more money, which gives us more power than we think.
        There's a glitch in lefty thinking that keeps us from exploiting
       their greed- we think we can punish them into better behavior.  The
       CostCo/WalMart issue should be our guide.  Oligarchs may prefer a
       low-wage society but they like success more.  They're not
       boycotting Costco stock, trust me.  They're dumping WalMart as they
       see WalMart's failure is inevitable.  They're not going to abandon
       a thriving business, ever.  Ideology never trumps money.  If we
       focused on creating media rock stars on the liberal side we'd see
       investment in liberal outlets. If we all immediately left WalMart,
       no matter how convenient, they'd sink overnight.  If we all bought
       electric or hybrid cars they'd be the only vehicles built.  If we
       each pressured our electric providers to be 100% green by 2020 it
       would happen.  If we money-bombed Congressional Dems who are
       fighting for NSA overhauls they'd become the majority cohort.
       We have the power.  Lets quit whining about problems and build
       solutions.

       They could care less what Perry or any of what these other puppets
       say as long as they keep taking ALEC's bribes and legislation under
       the table. the Dems have NOTHING to compare with the power of ALEC,
       especially since they influence broadcast news so much. Social
       media is our friend.
       We can't even vote these fools out of office anytime soon, so we

   in the fabric of corruption that when pulled, will unravel a case of
   broader scope, resulting in permanent political embarrassment that ends
   the governor's career and that of many of his Republican henchmen.

   Then Texans may rise up and make themselves free, turning their state

   Recommended by:

   is a way of life for Republicans; it's what they do.

   They lie to voters during campaigns to get elected, promising they
   don't have any intention of doing anything extreme, and then the moment
   they get elected they start misusing their authority and misusing
   taxpayer dollars at every turn to try to cram their corrupt insanity
   down everyone's throats.

   From deliberately trying to coerce citizens into not voting with
   outrageous voter suppression laws to deliberately misusing taxpayer
   dollars to get their own way--like Perry is doing--is simply a way of
   life for them.

   If Republicans are no longer allowed to do that, they would have no
   reason for existing.

   linked to this NYT article from late last year:

   It details Rick's "Texas Enterprise Fund" which gives tax breaks to
   large corporations, which breaks often consist of starving the local
   school district of property taxes.  Guess the results.

   Just an aside: what on earth kind of avalanche could ever occur in
   Lubbock, such that it is the local paper's name?  The place is known
   for FLAT!  No disrespect to Lubbock.  But I think a requirement would

 TX Oops Perry needs to go ([1269]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1270]nettwench

   One Texas town is already out of drinking water due to Perry allowing
   in Fracking that used up EVERY DROP of that towns drinking water. PA
   GOP Gov. allowed 300 pristine acres to be used as a toxic waste dump
   for toxic Fracking sludge. Most PA citizen's don't even know yet.
   GOP is making USA a third world toxic waste dump, and/or bankrupting
   and robbing every state they take over with "Town Managers" even when
   public votes against this abuse. A high court judge agreed and they're
   still going ahead with it anyway.
    Look what's happening to Museums and Art work where  Newspaper owner
   Hearst donated priceless works of Art to Museums, and the GOP appointed
   'Town Managers" wants to sell off priceless town owned Art, "to anyone
   he wants to, for any price HE DECIDES TO!!.
   Whether it's Perry or any other GOP run state, they lay waste to
   whatever they touch. Lie cheat steal their way across America. While
   Conservative owned media says nothing. IF there actually was a "Liberal
   owned media", if it existed 'we'd hear about these abuses sooner. None
   of them are reporting on the existing abuses on TV.
   One more thing. Homeowners across Texas and other states have found out
   Banks will not mortgage any homes near or around fracking sites, nor to
   those who already have contaminated water wells due to Fracking waste
   ruining underground wells for miles around where they blast, and or
   dump the toxic sludge.. Homes become worthless. The pipelines are
   already coming, most people just aren't aware, or even told Fracking is
   already going on and their homes may become worthless next.. This will
   be a third world waste dump if we don't stop all of this GOP pushed
   oil, and gas fracking right now. The fact that Perry is even being
   investigated at all, is just a short nod to the abuses he and others in
   his Party should be forced to answer for across this country. I just
   wish people would wake up.

   I hate Rick Perry, but this charge sounds like small potatoes. Probably
   not going to come to much.

    Perry has a bad habit of turning his crimes into legislation so you
   hardly need to investigate him to find out how he's breaking the law.
   We can start with his unconstitutional assaults on freedom of religion
   or contraception or privacy or health care or voting rights.... but I
