   Rep. Randy Weber (R-AZ) gives a pretty good example of the flavor of
   things today at the Steve King [31]press conference/rally against
   immigration reform:

     Mr. President. Build up this wall. [...] We need some sanity. The
     things that made America great are Americans like you that work and
     understand that it's sacrifice. You don't get to come over here and
     be takers.

   You need only listen to his words to know that Mr. Weber is a bigot.
   But he's also an idiot: Immigration reform isn't just the right thing
   to do from a moral perspective, according to the non-partisan
   Congressional Budget Office, it would reduce the deficit--[32]by a lot.
   This isn't a tough choice: Immigration reform isn't just good for
   people who want to become Americans, it's also good for people who
   already are Americans.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [45]Tagging tips - [46]Search For Tags - [47]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 It would seem so. ([193]0+ / 0-)
       This is Randy Weber, right?
       "Randy?" That would be a form of Randolph, which, according to the
       online etymological dictionary

     masc. proper name, from Old Norse Rannulfr "shield-wolf" and
     Frankish *Rannulf "raven-wolf," both brought to England by the
     Normans.
       Meanwhile, "Weber", according to the Wikipedia,

     is a surname of German origin, derived from the noun meaning
     "weaver".
       .
       And he is quoted in the diary as saying:

     Mr. President, Build up this wall. [...] We need some sanity. The
     things that made America great are Americans like you that work and
     understand that it's sacrifice. You don't get to come over here and
     be takers.
       IF ONLY someone who was of TRUE British Island stock, had been
       willing to say in, oh, about 410 A.D., when the Roman Emperor
       Honorius had told the Brits to look to their own defense against
       the Picts and Scots,
       IF ONLY then, someone had said in wonderfully Celticized Latin:
       "Emperor Honorius, build up this wall. We need some sanity. The
       things that made Britain great are Britons like us that work and
       understand that its sacrifice. You didn't come over here and be
       takers."
                What he really MEANT to say was,
                "I mean, damn it, Hadrian tried after all. But now
       Honorius has let it all go to pot. And so then all those
       "Randolph"-ish guys will start sneaking in from Norway. They have
       'wolf-y, shieldy' names like 'Rannulf'. Good grief, what kind of a
       normal, Britonic name is 'Rannulfr'? It doesn't even have any
       silent letters fro cryin' out loud! Isn't a guy like that just
       coming to Essex to be a taker of mutton? Who does he thiink he's
       going to be, any way? Someone bringing in foreign laws....like he
       could actually set up a Danelaw here in Britain for any length of
       time. Hah!
            "Or what if his Frankish cousin 'Rannulf' decides to fly in
       from Frank-dom? 'Rannulf?' Really? What good would he be in the
       armed forces with a drawing of a stupid raven riding on a wolf on
       his shield anyway? He'll bring in smelly cheese and good wine and
       spend his days on Salisbury plain taking good British wheat and
       butter and whipping it into croissants or something.
            "And Mr. Emperor? Don't go telling us to mind to our own
       defenses. First thing you know somebody will get it in their heads
       to invite in some of those Teutons as mercenaries, to be in OUR
       armies. That's right, Teutons! Can you IMAGINE what Britain would
       be like if we were overrun and resettled by a bunch of Angles? Or
       even Saxons? Good grief!
              Given time enough they'd probably even bring in their own
       'webers' to take away good jobs from Britons in the weaving
       industry. No way would any of those craft guilders stand for being
       called a mere 'weber', nope. They'd want to be called 'weavers'
       plain as day, not that stupid Anglo-Saxon grunting they call a
       language. No WAY will they come here and make this a Germanic
       language.
            (Thank the gods no one has gone as far as mentioning the
       Jutes. Can you imagine? Angles, Saxons and Jutes, the great
       rope-makers of Europa, all settling here? Good grief, you might as
       well say someday the Franks from Normandy might invade us. What
       would you call them anyway, Normans? The Norman Invasion?!? Hah!
       Big whoop THAT will ever happen believe you me!")
       So, gentle readers, you see the good congressman, good ole
       Raven-shield Weaver, was merely echoing what was once said long ago
       about protecting a sacred way of life.
       Way to go, Rannulf!

   Percentage of Latinos in their districts, and two of these have mostly
   Cuban-Americans and are pretty solid GOP.  The problem for them comes
   in 2016 with the presidential and the Senate races, when the 2010
   winners will be up and the map favors Dems.  If they take the Senate in
   2014, not too likely, they still face Obama's veto pen so it won't be
   like Kansas.

   This is all about the disproportionate share of the House that rural

 Having a fake SS number is a crime ([217]0+ / 0-)
       I agree with you that they're not taking from the system and
       instead won't get back what they paid in.  But really, isn't that
       their own fault?  They put themselves in a postion to be exploited.
       No one forced them to move here and get a fake number.  And when
       they agree to work for very little, all they do is allow the CEOs
       to get away with paying substandard wages.  I guarantee you that
       somewhere a poor single mother American citizen with a valid SS
       number was unable to find a job because she had the audacity to
       demand a fair wage.
       Supply and demand governs wages whether you want to admit it or
       not.  When people get fake SS numbers and then work for less than
       minimum wage, they drive down wages for everyone.  Who do you
       expect the CEO to hire?
       Person A who wants $10 an hour and time off to be with her child?
       Person B who will work 80-100 hours a week for $3 an hour?
       And P.S., legallizing everyone already here won't do a damn thing
       if a guest worker program simply allows the CEOs to bring in new
       groups of immigrants to exploit.

 Do you want morals or reality? ([227]0+ / 0-)
       You expect money grubbing CEOs to care about what's moral?  They
       care about making giant piles of money.
       SHOULD a CEO hire an immigrant at a fair $10/hr wage?  Of course.
       That CEO should also hire single mothers who need jobs, morally
       speaking.  But they don't.
       But WILL a CEO hire an immigrant at $10/hr when there are thousands
       more willing to work for half that?  And why would he ever pay more
       to hire the single mother?
       But really, to the heart of your argument, is it moral for an
       immigrant to bypass our laws, get a fake SS number, and then drive
       down wages?
       The truth is yes, they do put themselves in a position to be
       exploited.  Not doing that is part of the overall solution.
       An example:  I'm an engineer with a master's degree.  Let's say I
       decide I want to move to China.  If I apply for legal residency and
       I'm approved, then I can look for a job above board.  And if I
       don't like a deal or I'm mistreated, then I have legal avenues of
       recourse.  I am not in a position to be exploited.
       But if I sneak into China without any documentation and go begging
       for work, I pretty much have to take what I can get.  Who can I
       complain to if I'm mistreated - I broke the law to be there.  I put
       myself in a postion to be exploited.
       Moral is what should be.  Reality is what is.

       should be treating their workers morally all day long, it won't do
       anything.  If CEOs were good people we wouldn't be in most of the
       mess we are.
       If you don't want immigrants and H1B vias holders to be exploited,
       then we need to throw everyone who hires such a person to be thrown
       in jail.  The CEOs will then behave the way you want.  But not
       because it's moral, because they don't want to go to jail.
       And the immigrants who took the jobs for low wage need to be
       deported, to then apply for legal residency.  Not because it's the
       moral way to do it, but because cheating the system won't get them
       a job.

 Here's some reality ([239]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [240]Norm in Chicago

   Being exploited by being paid poorly by American standards, or send
   back home what amounts to a living wage by Mexican standards to feed
   your wife and kids? That's the reality for these people. They have no
   options in Mexico, and poor but comparatively manageable options in the
   US. Survival or not. That's as real as it gets.

   And the reason they're exploited here is because they can't complain
   about violations of labor standards or wage laws. They have no recourse
   to law enforcement, because for obvious reasons they're terrified of
   law enforcement. Legalize them and give them rights and we're all
   better off. I'll glad pay an extra dime a pound for the apples they
   pick if their gaining their rights makes the country a better place,
   which it would.

 Then there can be no guest worker program ([244]0+ / 0-)
       First, we can't solve global poverty by bringing all the world's
       poor to the US.  I've been in Mexico and seen the pamphlets in
       Spanish telling the Mexican poor to all move to the US.  The
       Mexican government doesn't want to deal with poverty.  They just
       want to export it all to us.  But that doesn't solve poverty.  It
       doesn't magically create jobs here for everyone at a good wage.  It
       simply means more people fighting over the same jobs, driving down
       wages and rising unemployment.
       If you want to legalize everyone here so they can complain and
       demand higher wages, then there must not be a guest worker program.
        Because you know exactly what will happen.  The worker picking
       apples today won't get a $0.1/lb raise, he'll get fired and
       replaced by a guest worker.  And then the newly legalized worker
       can go join the ranks of all the other unemployed Americans.
       There is only one way that legalization can work.  Everyone is
       legalized, and after that, anyone who hires an illegal immigrant
       goes to jail.  That's the only way that that wages will ever rise.
        If people are allowed to cheat, on either side, then nothing
       changes.

       If you want me to focus on the employers first, fine.  They
       shouldn't be hiring any immigrants or HIB visa holders until
       America citizen unemployment is zero and they simply cannot find
       ANYONE to do the job at any wage.
       When they're offering $150,000 a year for IT workers and still
       can't find job applicants, then they can hire HIB visa holders.
       Not before.
       But the employers aren't going to hire Americans at good wages when
       they have thousands of immigrants allowing themselves to be
       exploited at low wages.
       I don't want illegal immigrants with fake SS numbers to be

 Responsibility is to hire American ([272]0+ / 0-)
       I'll give you the same answer I gave Mimikatz.  Employers have a
       responsibility not to hire illegal immigrants with fake SS numbers.
        They have a responsibility to hire only legal American workers,
       and to pay the wage necessary to attract the talent they want.
       So tell me, if tomorrow every immigrant with a fake SS number was
       fired from their job, would you accept that because the employer is
       finally being responsible?  Or do you want the immigrant to keep
       the job?  If that is the case, explain why any employer would ever
       pay more to hire a legal American worker?

   not understand that President Obama is a son of an immigrant:

     Mr. President. Build up this wall. [...] We need some sanity. The
     things that made America great are Americans like you that work and
     understand that it's sacrifice. You don't get to come over here and
     be takers.

   I am sure he didn't mean the to compliment the President for being a

   hate you. Here is Gilberto Hinojosa's letter from my inbox this a.m.:

     Just last week we emailed you about Gov. Perry's War on Women. On
     Friday, Perry escalated that war and vetoed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair
     Pay Act.

     You read that right. Gov. Perry vetoed a bill that supported women
     getting paid the same as men. He no longer can even pretend to care
     about women.

     And last night, fellow Republican Texan Congressman Michael Burgess
     told a House Committee that he opposes abortion because male fetuses
     masturbate.

     Texas deserves better. Donate today to help us recruit strong
     candidates in 2014.

     Here's the thing. While Rick Perry may be our Governor, we still
     have strong Democratic leaders fighting on our behalf.

     The Lily Ledbetter Act was sponsored by Senator Wendy Davis and
     Representative Senfronia Thompson. They built the bipartisan
     coalition that adopted the bill in the Republican-controlled
     legislature.

     Senator Davis and Representative Thompson are the type of leaders we
     need here in Texas -- not extremists like Perry, Abbott, Gohmert and
     Burgess.

     Donate today to help us elect leaders that stand up for you!

     Perry thinks he has nothing to lose by discriminating against women.
     But we know he's wrong. In 2014, we will remember who supported us
     --- and who acted against us.

     We need to recruit candidates across the state, support their
     campaigns and organize on a local level. Your donation helps us work
     together to build a movement of Texans fighting against Governor
     Perry in the legislature and at the ballot box.

     Not backing down,

     Gilberto Hinojosa
     Chairman

     P.S. The past week made it clear: the Texas GOP is at war with Texas
     Women. Our fundraising deadline is less than two weeks away. Donate
     today to help us recruit statewide candidates that fight for all
     Texans.

   Now here is the thing. I do not have any money to send in, or time to
   work on this right now because of a pressing personal matter (helping a
   stroke victim navigate Medicare requirements for rehab).

   But seriously, when you have the kind of idiots bragging about signing
   laws to protect Merry Christmas we have running Texas, and the national
   party does not give a damn, what does that say about the effectiveness
   of the national party?

   Nothing impressive to me.

   I'd think on the Republican project to shift the tax burden exclusively
   onto the middle class.  This would have the dual purpose of enriching
   corporations and the one-percenters while increasing middle class rage.
    This rage is then redirected away from those who deserve it onto the
   lower classes, the poor, the old, and the immigrant population.
   "Takers," each and every one, forgetting that GE doesn't pay taxes,
   that the Koch brothers get those sweet, sweet government subsidies.

   But no, we can't embrace conspiracy theories here, so it just must be
   my overactive imagination.
