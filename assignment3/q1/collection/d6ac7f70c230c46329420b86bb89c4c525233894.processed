Official: Boston bombings suspects 'were going to attack' others

   By Chelsea J. Carter, CNN
   updated 10:46 PM EDT, Sun April 21, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * 55 people remain hospitalized from the marathon bombings
     * Doctors are ''cautiously optimistic'' a wounded transit officer
       will recover
     * The surviving suspect was shot in the side of the neck, a source
       tells CNN
     * Based on evidence, the brothers were going to attack others, an
       official says

   (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors were preparing charges Sunday against the
   surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings even as authorities
   said they believed he and his brother were allegedly preparing to carry
   out more attacks when their plans were disrupted.

   Authorities have not said publicly what charges will be filed against
   Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, but a Justice Department official, who has been
   briefed on the case, told CNN he will face federal terrorism charges
   and possibly state murder charges.

   Tsarnaev, 19, remains in serious but stable condition with a gunshot
   wound to the side of the neck, a federal law enforcement source with
   knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Sunday.

   It is unclear whether Tsarnaev was wounded during his capture or an
   earlier shootout with police that left his older brother -- the other
   man wanted in the bombings -- dead, said the source, who spoke on
   condition of anonymity.

   "He's not in a condition to be interrogated at this time," Boston
   Police Commissioner Ed Davis told reporters at a news conference on
   Sunday afternoon.

   However, another senior federal official who has been briefed on the
   investigation told CNN's Fran Townsend that Tsarnaev has communicated
   in writing with officials several times.

   Even as prosecutors worked to put together a case against Tsarnaev,
   Davis said he believed the brothers were planning another attack before
   a shootout with police disrupted their plans.

   "We have reason to believe, based upon the evidence that was found at
   the scene -- the explosions, the explosive ordnance that was unexploded
   and the fire power -- that they were going to attack other
   individuals," Davis said Sunday on CBS News' "Face the Nation."

   He did not say whether investigators had identified a specific target.

   Authorities believe the brothers bought bomb components locally, but
   their guns came from elsewhere, another federal law enforcement
   official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The official,
   who was not authorized to publicly discuss the case, said authorities
   are trying to trace the guns.

   Tsarnaev was captured Friday night, days after he and his brother
   allegedly planted two bombs near the finish line of the Boston
   Marathon. The blasts killed three people and wounded more than 170
   others.

   Authorities virtually shut down Boston and some of its suburbs as part
   of a manhunt after authorities say the brothers went on a rampage late
   Thursday and early Friday. The brothers allegedly hurled explosives at
   police after killing Massachusetts Institute of Technology police
   Officer Sean Collier and hijacking a car.

   What's next for the suspect?

   There are questions about whether Tsarnaev will ever be able to talk
   given the nature of his wound, Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, said Sunday
   on ABC's "This Week."

   "It doesn't mean he can't communicate, but right now I think he's in a
   condition where we can't get any information from him at all," said
   Coats, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

   The government has invoked the public safety exception in the case, a
   designation that allows investigators to question Tsarnaev without
   reading him his Miranda rights and without a lawyer present, said
   another Justice Department official, also speaking on condition of
   anonymity for the same reason.

   Suspect 2: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Suspect 2: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev

   Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel told reporters on a flight to Israel
   that he has not seen any intelligence that linked the brothers to any
   terrorist organization, but it was still early in the investigation.

   But Davis told CNN that he was confident that the brothers were "the
   two major actors in the violence that occurred."

   "I told the people of Boston that they can rest easily, that the two
   people who were committing these vicious attacks are either dead or
   arrested, and I still believe that," he said Sunday.

   The sentiment was echoed by Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau.

   "From what I know right now, these two acted together and alone," he
   said. "I think we have to be ever vigilant, and we're learning as we go
   along, but as far as this little cell -- this little group -- I think
   we got our guys."

   Hints of a radical?

   While investigators piece together the actions of the brothers in the
   months and days before the marathon bombings, there appear to be hints
   that the elder Tsarnaev was becoming radical.

   The Tsarnaev family hails from the Russian republic of Chechnya and
   fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s. The two brothers were born in
   Kyrgyzstan, authorities said.

   [41]Profiles of the two suspects

   An FBI official said Saturday agents [42]interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev
   in 2011 at the request of the Russian government. The FBI said Russia
   claimed he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer and
   that he had changed drastically since 2010.

   But a U.S. official and a law enforcement source said Sunday the
   Russian government's request was vague. The lack of specifics limited
   how much the FBI was able to investigate Tamerlan, the law enforcement
   official said.

   Tamerlan Tsarnaev [43]apparently became increasingly radical in the
   last three or four years, according to an analysis of his social media
   accounts and the accounts of family members. But so far, there is no
   evidence of active association with international jihadist groups.

   In August 2012, soon after returning from his visit to Russia, the
   elder Tsarnaev created a YouTube channel with links to a number of
   videos. Two videos under a category labeled "Terrorists" were deleted.
   It's not clear when or by whom.

   A CNN analysis of the YouTube channel has established that one deleted
   video featured a militant named Abu Dujana, whose real name was
   Gadzhimurad Dolgatov. CNN has located a video clip of the footage in
   question.

   Russian security services killed Dolgatov in December during an assault
   on an apartment in Makhachkala, the capital of the Russian Caucasus
   republic of Dagestan. Dolgatov led a small group in Dagestan that had
   links to the main Islamist militant group in the region, Imarat Kavkaz.

   [44]Older suspect in Boston bombings grew increasingly religious,
   analysis shows

   Separately, a U.S. intelligence source told CNN that investigators are
   looking into whether Tsarnaev had any connections with the group, known
   in English as Caucasus Emirates. The source says Tsarnaev had several
   computer links to the group in his social media activities, and
   investigators are looking into the possibility that he received
   "operational plans" from this group.

   Rebels who call themselves Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province
   of Dagestan issued a statement Sunday that appeared to distance the
   group from the Boston bombings, saying they are not fighting the United
   States.

   "We are at war with Russia," it said. The statement also said that
   children are never targets of the group.

   'He was just relaxed'

   As an army of officers hunted for the suspects in Monday's marathon
   bombings, [45]Dzhokhar Tsarnaev acted like any other college sophomore.

   He was on the campus of University of Massachusetts Dartmouth every day
   after the attack until late Thursday, a university official told CNN.
   Tsarnaev attended classes and went to the gym and dorm parties while
   much of Boston was at a tense standstill.

   On Tuesday, he and a fellow student were at the campus gym when the
   bombings came up in discussion.

   Zach Bettencourt said he expressed his shock about the attack, telling
   Tsarnaev that it was the type of thing you hear about in Iraq or
   Afghanistan, not Boston.

   He said Tsarnaev responded: "Yeah, tragedies happen man. Like these
   things happen around the world. It's crazy."

   A student at the school told The Boston Globe she saw Tsarnaev
   Wednesday night at a party that was attended by some of his friends
   from intramural soccer.

   "He was just relaxed," she said, asking the paper not to print her
   name.

   At the dorm where Tsarnaev lived, students joked Thursday as they
   viewed the FBI photos of the bombing suspects on television, a senior
   who lived in that dorm told The Boston Globe.

   "We made a joke like, that could be Dzhokhar," Pamala Rolon said. "But
   then we thought it just couldn't be him. Dzhokhar? Never."

   The campus, which was closed during the search for the bombing
   suspects, reopened Sunday morning.

   Moment of silence

   Boston, meanwhile, is trying to return to semblance of normalcy with
   some streets and business reopening.

   Federal investigators on Sunday were lifting crime scene tape and
   barriers erected during the investigation into the bombings near the
   marathon's finish line on Boylston Street.

   People throughout Massachusetts are being urged to observe a moment of
   silence Monday at 2:50 p.m., exactly one week after the Boston Marathon
   bombings.

   Of those injured in the marathon bombings, 55 remain hospitalized,
   including three in critical condition, according to a CNN count.

   Doctors, meanwhile, said Sunday that they are "cautiously optimistic"
   that a Massachusetts transit officer wounded in a shootout with the
   alleged Boston Marathon bombers will recover.

   Richard H. Donohue, 33, remains in critical condition at Mount Auburn
   Hospital in Cambridge, said Dr. Russell J. Nauta, a surgeon who
   operated on the officer.

   There was life before the bombings, and then life after.

   "We are all scattered in the pain and horror of this week's violence,"
   Boston's archbishop, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, told parishioners during
   Sunday services at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.

   "Some of those here were among those injured. But everyone has been
   affected."

   He voiced what so many have been thinking: Why would anyone do this?
   What were the bombers thinking?

   It has been "very difficult to understand what was going on in their
   heads," he said.

   Feyerick, Jill Dougherty, Pamela Brown, Julian Cummings, Barbara Starr,
