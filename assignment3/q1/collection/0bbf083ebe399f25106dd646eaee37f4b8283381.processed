   President Barack Obama prepares to take the stage as he is introduced
   at the National Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C.,
   May 23, 2013.
   President Barack Obama prepares to take the stage as he is introduced
   at the National Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C.,
   May 23, 2013.
   President Barack Obama, in yesterday's national security [29]speech:

     Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless
     `global war on terror' - but rather as a series of persistent,
     targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent
     extremists that threaten America [...]

   And:

     I believe, however, that the use of force must be seen as part of a
     larger discussion about a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy.
     Because for all the focus on the use of force, force alone cannot
     make us safe. We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology
     takes root; and in the absence of a strategy that reduces the
     well-spring of extremism, a perpetual war - through drones or
     Special Forces or troop deployments - will prove self-defeating, and
     alter our country in troubling ways.

   This might've been Obama's most substantive speech of his presidency.
   Conservatives are angry that Obama criticized the previous
   administration's use of torture and his continued insistence on
   shutting down Gitmo. Some liberals are angry that Obama has only partly
   curtailed the use of drones. But this was an eminently pragmatic speech
   and vintage Obama--straddling the line between two opposing forces and
   trying to find his sensible center. In this case, I actually think he
   found it.

   But aside from the argument over the details (which I'm sure is what'll
   get hashed out in the comments), the two passages above point to the
   most important takeaway from the speech: the declaration that our "war
   on terror" as we know it is over. The Republican approach--the
   immediate resort to violence, the debasing of our values by resorting
   to torture, the curtailment of our civil liberties--has failed.

     So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in
     efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF's mandate. And I
     will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further. Our
     systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must
     continue. But this war, like all wars, must end. That's what history
     advises. That's what our democracy demands.

   Extremism can't be eradicated. It can only be controlled, contained,
   and with luck, nullified. But as Boston and the [30]horrific attack in
   Woolwich a few days ago shows, it's impossible for us to prevent every
   isolated religious nut (whether Islamic or home-grown Christian) with a
   gun, pressure cooker, or even a meat cleaver from carrying deadly
   attacks.

   This is an amorphous, faceless enemy. There is no Osama Bin Laden
   calling the shots anymore. And engaging in large-scale military
   operations overseas does nothing to make us safer at home. Indeed,
   there is little more we can do at home to make us safer, short of
   becoming a bona fide police state.

   A terrorist inherently understands he is at a power disadvantage. They
   don't have any. Their numbers are too few, their resources too limited.
   Their foes are too strong. Thus, they engage in actions that create
   outsized fear and distress. They are only effective when they their
   limited actions can generate an outsized response. Osama Bin Laden is
   the most successful terrorist in the history of the world precisely
   because 9-11 dragged the United States into two wars, cost it thousands
   of lives, and cost it over a trillion dollars and counting. At the cost
   of what, a few box cutters and the meaningless lives of a handful of
   his followers?

   With Al Qaida effectively dismantled, we can't keep acting like every
   two-bit terrorist is part of the same struggle. Stop treating these
   copycats as evil masterminds and instead treat them like common
   criminals, and they lose some of their power. Stop smearing entire
   religions based on the actions of a few and treat them like ideological
   cranks, and they lose some of their power. Stop retaliating with brute
   force, vandalism, and threats, and treat their home communities well
   (be it Mali, or the local mosque in Boston), and these terrorists lose
   some of their power.

   None of that is as glorious as shocking and awe'ing Baghdad, but they
   promise better results than the status quo. The "war against terror"
   was always a stupid concept. It's good seeing Obama put it to rest. And
   not with a "mission accomplished" banner and ticker-tape parade, but
   with the acknowledgement that this will be an ongoing struggle, likely
   lasting our lifetimes. And the best way to deny wannabe terrorists
   their victory is by refusing to let them affect our way of life.

   What does that mean? It means that the thousands of runners who'll line
   up for the 2014 Boston Marathon will do more to combat terrorism than
   1,000 Iraq invasions ever would.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       A lot of us are determined not to put another DLC candidate in the
       WH. We lived through the 90's debacle - at congressional, state and
       local levels as well. The idea that we can't elect a true
       progressive at this point in history is sheer pessimism. This is
       not the 90's. It is a ridiculous denial that we have no other very
       competent candidates.
       The idea that we would beg a person to start a first term at age
       69, after her decades of high stress and output, is frankly cruel.
       Even Bill asked people to stop speculating and leave her alone. She
       has more than earned spending the best of her golden years out of
       the pressure cooker and spot lights. I suspect she will rival any
       of the ex presidents and Gore on substantive accomplishments.

 That's why I keep chipping away ([237]0+ / 0-)
       The die hards won't change. There are plenty who are still learning
       a lot and thinking with fewer preconceptions. It still confuses me
       how unable to reframe many progressives are.
       Humanity has undergone a fairly significant shift in how much
       change each generation will see. In many ways, I think the WWII gen
       saw the most dramatic change ever in standard of living, science
       and tech development. Now our changes are not as big a jump, but
       happen very frequently.
       Cell phones, computers, TVs, cars with navigation, etc. The barrage
       of new adaptation contributes to abnormal stress levels. Add how
       much time people are hearing something- music, TV, talk radio,
       phone call, etc. there is no down time from waking to sleeping.
       Many are still clinging to what used to be true, despite plenty of
       evidence that so much has changed. In more ways than politics, this
       is not the 90's. The take away lessons of the 90's are being
       confused with the ones that only worked because of the situation
       then.
       What we accomplish in '14 is going to be really critical. If enough
       voters get a clear picture and help vote in not only more dems, but
       dems who will cut the lobbyists out, we would have a chance to
       elect a real progressive in '16. Also if enough climate change
       reality starts sinking in.

       He specifically said that he opposed the use of armed drones on US
       soil.  Are you talking about unarmed ones?  If so where's your
       source for the 30000 number or is this just a projection?
       See the link in the diary (emphasis added)

     For the record, I do not believe it would be constitutional for the
     government to target and kill any U.S. citizen - with a drone, or a

 I believe ([280]0+ / 0-)
       The 30,000 number refers to all unmanned air craft. I imagine many
       of these will be controlled by state and local governments, in
       addition to the private sector. Also, Obama is referring to "armed
       drones". He did not discuss the implications of surveillance
       drones.

   there was Lindsay Graham going on in his hush-puppy whine, one of the
   guys who voted to send the country into two unnecessary wars and has
   worked against appropriate funding for returning vets.

   I'm going to take Obama at his word on this, and I hope he will be able
   to follow through and not be completely stymied by do-nothing Repubs.
   If you'll notice what he's been doing and saying recently, almost every
   major statement has been a "refudiation" of some aspect of Bush the
   Lesser's splendid little Mesopotamian misadventures.

   Getting Congress to declare the war on terror to be over won't be easy.
   It will take more than blaming Obama for not doing it for us. The
   movement will have to work on it.

   "Drones v. manned bombing" is a distraction compared to ending this
   stupid war. It seems that a portion of the left focus on drones because
   it's a way to put the focus on Obama. But, this calls for pushing

   for example, consist of those that wanted to use military force to stop
   the slaughter in Rwanda.  There are many on the left that wish we had
   tried to stop that genocide rather than sitting back and watching it
   happen.  Samantha Power is an example of someone on the left that
   favors judicious use of military action to stop slaughters.  And I
   would maintain that those on the left that feel that way are not evil
   or less moral than the 100% pacifist "anti-war left".

   Same goes for the Libya intervention a couple years ago.  There were
   front pagers on DKos calling for the US to get involved before we
   actually did.  Those people were for military action, while still being
   "left".

   Same goes for those on the left that were glad that we used military
   force to take down OBL.  In that particular case, the anti-war left, I
   guess, would be represented by Greenwald, who lectured us for not
   reading OBL Miranda rights and trashed ordinary Americans for
   celebrating OBL's demise.  (Of course, Greenwald isn't part of the
   anti-war left himself, given that he supported W's invasion of Iraq.)

   These people in the "pro-war left" aren't really "pro-war" in the sense
   that they demand use of military force all the time or as a first
   resort, but they aren't against military action in all circumstances
   either.  And they are not, IMO, less moral than those that are 100%
   pacifist.

       That sounds like revisionism to me, especially on the Libya
       situation.  The people cheering for the bombing of Libya were
       exhibiting all kinds of warmongering characteristics and attacking
       those who were against another failed intervention where the people
       of the country we claim to want to "save" end up much worse off,
       and their resources mysteriously end up in the hands of western
       corporations.
       It's good that you brought up some of those examples though,
       because that is exactly where, if you go back and look at the
       comment threads, you can find the zealous pro-war left.  You can
       also find them in diaries discussing the drone wars.

 Meteor Blades was for the Libya operation. ([660]0+ / 0-)
       Madeline Albright was for using military force to stop atrocities
       in Bosnia.
       Samantha Power was for both the Libya operation and was for using
       force to stop atrocities in Rwanda.
       Joe Biden was for pulling troops in Afghanistan but at the same
       time massively increasing drones strikes in the Afghan/Pakistan
       border region.
       President Obama was for using military force to take down OBL.
       President Clinton was for using military force to stop atrocities
       in Bosnia and restore a democratically elected leader in Haiti.
       Speaking of Libya, the reason the intervention was launched was
       that Gadhafi was marching troops to Benghazi, vowing to exterminate
       the population.
       The anti-war left opposed all of the above actions (or potential
       actions, in the case of Rwanda), but it's arguable as to whether
       refusing to use military force to stop an atrocity really is more
       moral than using military force to stop said atrocity.  It's
       arguable as to whether using special forces to take down OBL really
       is an immoral act for use of military force.  The anti-war left
       presumes that these are settled matters, that there's not a good
       faith argument to be made against their position.
       At any rate, 100% pacifism has never been necessary to be "left",
       nor has it even been the case that being "anti-war" in particular
       instances is a characteristic of the left or characteristic of the
       moral high ground.  For example, during the US Civil War, in the
       north it was conservatives who were "anti-war".  During WWII, in
       the US it was conservatives (like Lindbergh) who were anti-war.
       But not only were those groups not "left" for their opposition to
       the respective wars,  neither of those groups even held the moral
       high ground for being anti-war in those cases, quite the contrary
       in fact.

       First, I'm part of the anti-war left. I organized numerous events
       against both wars, and continued to do so after Obama took office.
       I didn't vote for Obama believing he would quickly enact every
       policy I wanted or immediately end the war in Afghanistan. He made
       it clear during the campaign that he wouldn't. I supported Obama
       because he provided the OPPORTUNITY for change, not a guarantee of
       change. He seemed like someone who would respond when the
       grassroots built support around progressive goals.
       I haven't been that disappointed in Obama because I didn't expect
       him to deliver change on a platter. He did warn us that he
       wouldn't. I've been far, far more disappointed in activists who
       apparently feel that whining about Obama and repeating "where's the
       hope and change?!!?!" cliches is an acceptable substitute for
       actual organizing. We were supposed to push Congress and Obama, but
       there was less organized pushing and more cynical pissing and
       moaning.
       No, Obama's policies are not worse than Bush's. He curtailed the
       worst practices. I don't enjoy exaggeration. Yes, Obama does need
       to be pushed to do more. I bet he'll do more once the left builds
       support for better policies. That's our job.
       Getting Congress to repeal the AUMF is an organizing opportunity
       but I'm afraid the netroots won't be up to the task. Too many want
       a President Santa Claus to do it for them.

       Is there something about killing someone with a drone that makes it

       have been negotiated.  I don't know how many of those are near
       Iran, but it has been reported that a number of them are.
       Thousands, maybe more than ten thousand troops will be kept in
       Afghanistan, and though the "noncombat" language is being used,
       that will almost certainly turn out not to be true because it's
       also being reported that Special Ops troops will be there and will
       be busy and while their mission might be defined as "training" they
       will definitely be engaged in combat.
       The arrangement between our military and the governments of other
       countries is such that we're training special operations commando
       type troops in their countries, and working together with them to
       build forces. This is in addition to the "regular" armies in these
       countries, especially in Afghanistan.  We're still learning about
       what our CIA paramilitary is doing there, and about their actions
       and JSOC actions.
       We did similar things in Iraq and in recent months those activities
       in Iraq have increased, not decreased.  We're also ramping up in
       Africa.
       The perpetual war is not ending, it's just morphing.  There are
       reasons for changing or repealing the AUMF, and ways to do it so
       that it won't mean much of anything to repeal it.  While Obama is
       talking about ending the perpetual war, his Pentagon is also
       talking about how it might continue for 10-20 years.  They are,
       presumably, talking about the Dirty Wars led by JSOC and
       intelligence agencies. There is no end in sight for those, and it
       could be argued that the dirty wars are creating more terrorists
       than they are killing.  Obama talks about "associated forces" and
       also listen for other words like that, including the word
       "adherents" .  The term "associated forces" is not in the original
       AUMF. The original AUMF only refers to the people who were involved
       in 9/11 or sheltered them.  That is a problem for Obama because in
       order to wage his war wherever he wants (which is what he's doing)
       he needs that vague "associated forces" language.
       "Associated forces" language is in the other AUMF that a lot of
       people forget about. The AUMF for war in Iraq, and there is no
       reason for that AUMF to still be in place.  Obama should have asked
       for it to be repealed as soon as the photo op of the last combat
       troops leaving Iraq was finished. But he did not, and in fact he
       opposed the repeal of the Iraq AUMF because there is language in it
       that's critical for continuing business as usual. When Rand Paul,
       Wyden, Merkely and some others tried to repeal it more than a year
       ago, Obama did not want that.
       So the "repeal" of the AUMF that Obama talks about is more likely
       to be a new authorization, not tied to 9/11 and one that states
       that he can wage the dirty wars anywhere and can kill anyone who he
       decides is a threat to the US, or anyone "associated" to them.
       Basically, this is what he's doing now but it's being done with a
       patchwork of laws and assumptions about what his Article 2 powers
       are.  He's cleaning up the laws, giving himself unprecedented war
       powers for himself and future executives.  And now he's shown us
       that he's going to do it under the auspices of ending the Forever
       War when in reality he's expanding his war powers and making them
       permanent, as long as Congress will agree to it, and there's no
       reason to doubt that they will limit him in any way since they have
       completely abdicated their Constitutional powers in matters of war.

     In the first major Pakistani court ruling on the legality of the

     said this morning that strikes are `criminal offences'. Chief
     Justice Dost Muhammad Khan ordered Pakistan's government to `use
     force if need be' to end drone attacks in the country's tribal
     regions.

     He ruled that US drone strikes in Pakistan constitute a `war crime'
     and are a `blatant violation of basic human rights', killing
     hundreds of civilians. He ordered the government to `forcefully'
     convey to the US that it must end drone strikes and called on the UN
     Security Council to intervene.

       And Kos needs to stick to doing site maintenance.
       Can anyone be more clueless? Just last week, Michael Sheehan, the
       assistant secretary of defense for special operations told the
       Senate Armed Services committee that the "war on terror" will last
       "[962]At least another 10 to 20 years."

     The war in Afghanistan may be winding down. But the Pentagon's chief
     of irregular warfare still sees a war against al-Qaida that will
     last decades, all over the world -- a prospect that prompted
     astonishment and constitutional debate in the Senate.

     Asked at a Senate hearing today how long the war on terrorism will
     last, Michael Sheehan, the assistant secretary of defense for
     special operations and low-intensity conflict, answered, "At least
     10 to 20 years."
       That "debate" included this:

     "You guys have essentially rewritten the Constitution here," said
     Sen. Angus King (I-Maine). King pointed out that the 2001
     Authorization to Use Military Force against al-Qaida, or AUMF, was
     specifically bounded to avenging the 9/11 attacks, and does not
     contain the words "associated forces" repeatedly invoked by Taylor,
     the top Pentagon lawyer.

     "You guys have invented this term, associated forces, that's nowhere
     in this document," King said. "It's the justification for
     everything, and it renders the war powers of Congress null and
     void." Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), expressed incredulity over the
     Pentagon's broad interpretation of the AUMF. "None of us" who voted
     for the law in 2001 "could have envisioned [granting] authority [to
     strike] in Yemen and Somalia," McCain said.
     The panel's chairman, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), jumped to the
     Pentagon's defense, saying that "any co-belligerent" was an
     appropriate target under established principles of international
     law.
       Obama's speech was clearly a response to the bit of uproar among
       the Senate and among many in the country who are WOT fatigued.
       To post this without acknowledging the Sheehan  comments or the
       broader context is pure Wolf Blitzerishness. Seriously, this is the
       type of shit I expect from CNN.
       Regardless, this is just Obama, once again, talking a bunch of shit
       that completely contradicts his real policy.
       Just like Obama's speech decrying the government spying on
       journalist right after his own government revealed they had spied
       on journalists.
       It reminds me of Reagans denial of the Iran Contra scandal:
       "My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the
       facts and evidence tell me it is not."
       Apparently, that kind of shit works on some people.

   Congressional action it will take to withdrawal their authorization of
   force. There's no need to wait for Obama. He already made it a

   I tend to agree with the excellent analysis expressed by Cliff Schecter

       Nothing in the AUMF requires that he exercise war powers he has.
       And I'm not certain he needs any authorization to simply deal with
       the prisoners as he will, take them off the island, and thereby
       "close" the present use of Gitmo as we know it.
       I can be wrong however, and would appreciate a pointer to the

       blocked him in many ways from bringing Gitmo prisoners here. He can
       certainly send some to other countries, which I think is what they
       are trying to do with Yemenis who have been cleared to be released.
       But for others who need to be tried, I think they have blocked him
       from transferring them here.
       Certainly, he can not use the powers given to him in AUMF. But then
       liberals would complain(correctly, imo) that that does nothing to
       prevent a future president from using them. Thus, the reason the
       law needs to be changed.

   Read that way, it seems that Obama is actually asking for, through the

   In the modern era that is akin to George Washington stepping down after
   two terms.

   What is the history of Congress actively taking away Presidential war

       The Presidential War Powers Act comes immediately to mind as an

       It's why many in the anti-war left supported Obama, even knowing he
       would carry out some policies we strongly disagree with. The war on
       terror must be ended and Presidential power must be curtailed. A

     With Al Qaida effectively dismantled, we can't keep acting like
     every two-bit terrorist is part of the same struggle. Stop treating
     these copycats as evil masterminds and instead treat them like
     common criminals, and they lose some of their power. Stop smearing
     entire religions based on the actions of a few and treat them like
     ideological cranks, and they lose some of their power. Stop
     retaliating with brute force, vandalism, and threats, and treat
     their home communities well (be it Mali, or the local mosque in
     Boston), and these terrorists lose some of their power.

   Rather than addressing every threat with a sledgehammer, our primary
   focus should be on effective intelligence, targeted enforcement, AND
   winning hearts and minds.

   An approach that "makes enemies faster than we can kill them", as was
   the approach of the Neocons, is very ineffective.

   done with war, it's not a winning issue.

       I suspect there are people in positions of power, who do not hold

       of what politician gets elected.
       I also know that politicians tend to change after a successful

       We may or may not like what he does and the choices he makes but

       I wasn't necessarily referring to President Obama specifically --
       all politicians have to resist lobbying efforts by powerful
       corporate entities, sooner or later. The degree of influence these
       entities have really shouldn't be that controversial of a subject,
       it seems to me. To brush it off as some form of CT seems precisely
       the type of reaction these entities would be quite satisfied with.
       I do not endorse "giving up."
       People are quick to point the finger at lobbyists, congress, and
       other factors beyond his control when it appears Obama is being
       blamed unfairly, so why is it implausible those same outside
       influences might be at work in other ways?

       for CU, you are mistaken.
       If you think lobbyists, big corporations, the Koch brothers, and
       the MIC are not a problematic influence on the way things work in
       this country, you are naive.
       To not acknowledge the incredible pace at which the rich are
       getting richer and the poor are getting poorer these days and to
       write off calling attention to the reasons for this occurring is
       the epitome of denialism. It has nothing to do with "victimization
       being a noble burden."

 The rich are no richer or more ([1627]0+ / 0-)
       powerful than they were in the Gilded Age, and the general populace
       is WAY better off than our counterparts were then.  It's a matter

       the worst times ever are not studying history, not appreciating the
       many ways we are better off now, and remarkably unwilling to budge

       Seeing no change in either direction, even if that were truly the

       Doesn't seem to make the case FOR rubber stamping everything Obama

       And I am quite capable of understanding the difference between
       motivating to act and hiding and denying. How you seem to think
       "rubber-stampers" are doing the former and the
       "non-rubber-stampers" are doing the latter, when its actually the

   you to know it was not you I was ranting at, but an idea and way of
   thought that I see growing among some of us here. I meant this what I
   said here.

     I have to say that I find it more than just cynical, and understand
     I'm not ranting at you, just the idea that it's game over because we
     can't fight the money. If that is the case then wtf are we doing
     here?

   No, you didn't mention the Pres and it is true that all those
   influences are at work in our government and daily lives, but as I love
   OCD said, they always have been.

   They were just as powerful when Lincoln, FDR, and Teddy R were in
   power. We fight them always and sometimes win.

   It becomes easy to point to that Enemy and blame everything on it, from
   things the Pres does or doesn't do to the entire state of affairs. Some
   of it is true, most of it stems from a feeling of helplessness.

   Shaking off that feeling is the only cure.

       They kind of expected him to, you know, listen to what they had to
       say, favorable or unfavorable.
       And equally as present are a cohort of people who have no problem
       contorting their positions to match those held by the president on
       any given issue.

       you'd have a right to bitch that he wasn't meeting your
       requirements.  You weren't alone on Election Day.  He was
       re-elected by a landslide, in a weak economy, with CU money pouring
       into every corner of the country. That's pretty damn impressive and
       we should be celebrating not kvetching.  But like I said, Democrats
       kvetch.  We like winning, too many of us hate the actual business
       of governing a large and diverse nation.  It's never clean enough,
       idealistic enough, personally satisfying enough.  For those people
       nothing meets their dreams, no win is decisive enough, no loss by
       the opposition is humiliating enough, every compromise is a
       sellout, every moderate success needs to be killed because a
       ideologically pure loss is better than a tainted win.  Very black
       and white, no sense of sharing the country with others who may
       disagree, no notion that life is lived in the grey areas, few of us
       manage perfection and purity on a regular basis.

   the targets are, in fact, U.S citizens, or anyone else really, actually
   actively plotting to kill US citizens.  And that is the rub. Ensuring
   that the intelligence is sound, that there is no other way to prevent
   the attack or capture the suspect.

   Out of the four Americans killed, only one was such a target. That
   means that three were not targeted, but still remain as dead as the one
   "sniper."

   I don't think there are easy answers. There is a need for our national
   defense. Just like there is a need for SWAT teams, but they must be
   tightly controlled. And we have to respect that we are a nation of law.

   progressives who scoff at the speech because it didn't come soon

   It's going to be difficult to bring this limitless war to a close
   because of the profits it has generated for the MIC.  The GOP will howl

   I've written in the drone debates that the real issue is that we're in
   an open-ended, unending war on terror. Whether we kill civilians with
   drones as opposed to manned bombers is a relatively minor detail. What
   we need to be doing is getting Congress to declare the war against
   terror to be over.

   In this regard, Obama is leading the anti-war movement. He showed the
   disorganized, unfocused remnants of the movement what to do next. He
   has made the #1 priority politically achievable with this speech.

   braver to suggest that perhaps we shouldn't be looking for new wars to
   start.

   I love the fact that he decried war on Memorial Day and that he did so
   by using part of the title of a great

   the USA had taken this approach from the beginning and approached
   terrorist acts as criminal acts, to be dealt with by intelligence
   agencies and the justice system instead of by warfare.

   But no. After 9/11 most Americans were after retribution instead of
   justice. So here we are. Much poorer by humanitarian and moral
   standards, as well as economic.

   I was one of the few who opposed war on Afghanistan and one of the many
   who opposed war on Iraq. I hope lessons have been learned and that next
   time the nation won't be so eager to go to war.

   Everyone knows Rep Barbara Lee is the only member of Congress who voted

   She has been leading a pretty lonely endeavor to back it out.  Prior to
   the President's speech she was [2316]working on legislation, the Drones
   Accountability Act.

   With the President using AUMF and repeal in the same sentence, all 70
   or so members of [2317]the Progressive Caucus should be eager to
   co-sponsor a straight repeal of the AUMF that was passed in 2001.

   This should have been an issue of primary importance in the '12

   contrast with Republicans.  Is America's future going to be profitized
   war and an endless cycle of violence and retaliation?  The endless war

   signalling a shift that we all want and need as a nation.
   it was a speech based in reality, the reality of governance of the USA
    in the world.
   i think this was an important, meaningful speech.

   this week the GOP is railing about it..and i think it has them between
   a rock and hard place on two fronts

   1. they are red faced and screaming that they still want war. Who do
   YOU know that still wants war?  i cannot think of a single person i
   personally know who is not sick of these wars.

   2 they are also screaming about the lack of funding making our military
   unable to protect our interest abroad. bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
   first of all, we are still armed to the hilt, second of all, the GOP
   was the party red faced and screaming about the deficit, now they are
   red faced and screaming about the budget cuts.

   these warmongering assholes seem to want their cake and eat it too,
   sorry for the cliche phrase, but it fits.

   i don't think people are going to buy it.  i don't think a lot of
   people who voted for GOP candidates last go around are going to buy it.

   as for president Obama, I credit him with trying to articulate and
   advocate an end to perpetual war, even as he has to manage the crapcake
   of a foreign war and covert war he inherited and we , the US have
   inhabited for decades, even as he walks the tightwire of how to take

   Does this mean our long held policies such as regime changes, I'm
   thinking of the ongoing butchery in Syria by our Al-qaeda linked

   All that work by Brookings - [2367]Which Path to Persia will be put on

   All of the huge expenditures for surveillance of the public all for

   I would expect the policies to remain in place but paying our proxies
   do the the dirty work with fewer US "boots on the ground".

 Hope some on this site ([2378]0+ / 0-)

   will challenge themselves to add to humanitarian efforts. There are
   many great organizations that you can help with donations or voluteer
   work. I'd like to see this part of the speech highlighted more
   frequently.

   "And we must help countries modernize economies, upgrade education, and
   encourage entrepreneurship - because American leadership has always
   been elevated by our ability to connect with peoples' hopes, and not
   simply their fears.

   Success on these fronts requires sustained engagement, but it will also
   require resources. I know that foreign aid is one of the least popular
   expenditures - even though it amounts to less than one percent of the
   federal budget. But foreign assistance cannot be viewed as charity. It
   is fundamental to our national security, and any sensible long-term
   strategy to battle extremism. Moreover, foreign assistance is a tiny
   fraction of what we spend fighting wars that our assistance might
   ultimately prevent. For what we spent in a month in Iraq at the height
   of the war, we could be training security forces in Libya, maintaining
   peace agreements between Israel and its neighbors, feeding the hungry
   in Yemen, building schools in Pakistan, and creating reservoirs of
   goodwill that marginalize extremists."

   Perpetual War Borscht. You can have it served hot or cold. High-tensity
   or low-intensity.

   Which ever you think you're ordering, overall you get it luke warm.
   That is, hotter is some spots than others.

   I don't blame the president for this. It started before he appeared,
   and it will continue long after he's gone. I also don't praise him for
   ending it. He isn't.

   Apart from "perpetual war" being far from over, Kos' post seems spot
   on. The individual points in the diary makes sense. The title is a bit
   off. "Perpetual war goes on, but it needs to be matched with a better
   strategy" would seem more reflective of the take-away from the speech.

   Of course, there could be something I'm missing in his speech.

       I put the responsibility on your shoulders for the food being too
       hot or cold.  I don't care who put the damned food in the

       power on the absolute lowest setting, you are part of the problem.
       President Obama has had a lot of time to take the food out of the
       microwave, and rather than actually doing anything, he and Congress
       have watched the American plate and watched everything on it, from
       the average household income gaining no steam, to the rich's income
       exploding.  The wars and the rich and the ill gotten gains from
       both are too hot to eat, and the poor's portion is small and
       underdone.

   I think it's so important you pointed out that in this speech,
   President Obama effectively declared the war over.

   What's jaw dropping to me is the number of perpetually disappointed
   progressives who either won't believe it, or think that prosecuting
   Bush and Cheney is required for the war to be over, or articulate some
   other disappointment.

   If you're anti-war, can't you acknowledge that the president just
   announced the war is over?

   It doesn't mean the end of counter-terrorism, which existed long before
   Bush.

   It means, as the president pointed out, that we are going back to a law
   enforcement paradigm and away from the military/war paradigm.

   He said things that needed to be said and that is a good thing.
   Finally,  the President acknowledges that we can not be at war forever
   without damaging ourselves in significant ways.  The question is where
   does this go.  If we are going to wait on cooperation with Congress
   nothing will come from this.  The President must act unilaterally.
   Possibilities:

   1) He can't close Guantanamo Bay formally but he sure can empty it out
   by sending the people we have no legal case against home.  The rest
   need a speedy trial and I see no reason why the military is incapable
   of that.

   2) He can place the drones under military control.  He can act to
   reduce the number of strikes.

   3) He can reduce our military foot print overseas.  Bring more troops
   home, close bases.

   It would surely be great if the AUMF was re-negotiated along more
   limited lines.  But there is no reason for him to wait on that.

   There's nothing in this to convince me the perpetual war is over:

     So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in

     will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further. Our
     systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must
     continue. But this war, like all wars, must end. That's what history
     advises. That's what our democracy demands.

   "Engaging Congress"... hah hah hahh!! that's a good one.

   "I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further".
   Meaningless statement, since nobody is suggesting "expanding" the
   AUMF... it's working perfectly fine now.

   "Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must

   [2467]http://www.guardian.co.uk/...

     The hallmark of a skilled politician is the ability to speak to a
     group of people holding widely disparate views, and have all of them
     walk away believing they heard what they wanted to hear. Other than
     Bill Clinton, I've personally never seen a politician even in the
     same league as Barack Obama when it comes to that ability. His most
     consequential speeches are shaped by their simultaneous affirmation
     of conflicting values and even antithetical beliefs, allowing
     listeners with irreconcilable positions to conclude that Obama
     agrees with them.

     The highly touted speech Obama delivered last week on US terrorism
     policy was a master class in that technique. If one longed to hear
     that the end of the "war on terror" is imminent, there are several
     good passages that will be quite satisfactory. If one wanted to hear
     that the war will continue indefinitely, perhaps even in expanded
     form, one could easily have found that. And if one wanted to know
     that the president who has spent almost five years killing people in
     multiple countries around the world feels personal "anguish" and
     moral conflict as he does it, because these issues are so very
     complicated, this speech will be like a gourmet meal.

   And further down in the article Glen Greenwald writes...

     The terrorism speech, when dissected, provided very little in the
     way of actual concrete substance. Its most heralded passage, as the
     ACLU quickly pointed out, did nothing more than call for the
     "ultimate" repeal of the AUMF; "the time to take our country off the
     global warpath and fully restore the rule of law is now," said the
     ACLU's executive director Anthony Romero, "not at some indeterminate
     future point." Moreover, he noted, "the president still claims broad
     authority to carry out targeted killings far from any battlefield,
     and there is still insufficient transparency."

     In lieu of substance, the speech was heavy on feel-good rhetoric,
     mostly designed to signal that unlike the mean and simplistic George
     Bush - who presumably pursued these policies thoughtlessly and
     simplistically - Obama experiences inner turmoil and deep moral and
     intellectual conflict as he embraces them. "For me, and those in my
     chain of command, those [civilian] deaths will haunt us as long as
     we live," the president claimed. He added that drones and other new
     weapons technologies "raise[] profound questions -- about who is
     targeted, and why; about civilian casualties, and the risk of
     creating new enemies; about the legality of such strikes under US
     and international law; about accountability and morality."

     This "he-struggles-so-very-much" conceit is one Obama officials have
     been pushing for awhile, as when they anonymous boasted to the New
     York Times about Obama's deep personal involvement in choosing the
     targets of his "kill list", something he insists upon because he is
     "a student of writings on war by Augustine and Thomas Aquinas" and
     wants to ensure compliance with those lofty principles. That same
     article quoted the supremely obsequious former Obama adviser Harold
     Koh as hailing torture advocate and serial deceiver John Brennan as
     "a person of genuine moral rectitude" who ensures that the "kill
     list" is accompanied by moral struggle: "It's as though you had a
     priest with extremely strong moral values who was suddenly charged
     with leading a war," Koh said.

   However looking at the title of this diary I feel I gotta add this..

     When it comes to liberals eager to be fooled, Douthat could easily
     have been talking here about his own newspaper's editors. Within
     minutes after the completion of Obama's speech, literally, the New
     York Times editorial page posted a lengthy and gushing editorial
     headlined "The End of Perpetual War"
