   Michele Bachmann and Rush Limbaugh
   2013 March to Madness Freakshow Four
   [30]Full tournament recap
   So it's here: The semi-final round of the 2013 Republican March to
   Madness is upon us. The winners of the regional brackets have all been
   set and today we begin the process of whittling the field down to a two
   last contenders.

   Voting will start today and last until Monday morning, when we'll
   announce the two finalists and begin the championship round to crown
   the poster-child for Republican craziness.

   The full tournament recap is [31]here and with such a deep field of
   lunatics the semifinalists can be proud to be honored as the craziest
   of the craziest. But only two can survive this second-to-last round.
   And you decide who moves on.

   Later today, we'll kick off our second Freakshow Four matchup, #1 seed
   Rick Santorum from the Theocons Region vs. #4 seed Dick Cheney from the
   GOP Establishment Region. But for now we're beginning with #1 seed Rush
   Limbaugh from the Right-wing Media Region and #4 seed Michele Bachmann
   from the Teabaggers Region.

   Limbaugh's path to victory included wins over luminaries like Glenn
   Beck and Ann Coulter as well as clowns like Dick Morris. Bachmann
   knocked off heavyweights like Steve King, Ted Cruz, and Allen West, a
   true lunatic's row of competitors. Will her string of successes be
   enough momentum to knock off yet another? We're about to learn the
   answer.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [49]Tagging tips - [50]Search For Tags - [51]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       This is a decision to

     to crown the poster-child for Republican craziness.
       As such, Rush Limbaugh is too calculating for me to consider him
       crazy. His vowel movements are for ratings and attention, though I
       have no doubt he is a truly vile, evil, racist, bloated sac of
       protoplasm who has wasted far too much oxygen.

 I totally agree, but I think Rush is more ([196]0+ / 0-)
       significant in keeping the goppers from straying from their
       anti-American, crazy agenda.  He runs the GOP.  But Michele, she's
       in a class by herself.

       Limbaugh is a calculating slimeball and Michelle Bachmann is two
       miles into la-la land.  I think Bachmann may lose next time aroung,
       even in her gerrymandered district.  Even her own constituents are
       getting tired of her.  I voted for Limbaugh, because even though
       his ratings are tanking, he still represents the Reptilian Party
       the best.  But this is going to be a close one.

 So when we say "How does allowing teh gayz to ([236]0+ / 0-)

       Michele.  "If gays can marry, do you believe he'd still be married
       to her?"  And they'd have a point.

   Sure the Republican party follows him and would (and have) believed
   every crazy thing he tells them.  Still, I see him as sane - he
   believes that he's an entertainer.  Michelle, otoh, believes the
   whispers in her head that are put there when wind blows around the vast
   emptiness.  She's the true believer, the true crazy one to lead her
   followers and the rest of the Republican party off the cliff.

       yet, I still voted for the gasbag.
       The reason I voted for Limbaugh is simply power.
       o Bachmann's power essentially is to embarrass anyone who hears her
       rants.  And I know from personal experience; I lived in her
       district until the 2010 census moved it.  But she can't really blow
       up the Republican Party.
       o  Limbaugh, on the other hand, is currently working the trifecta:
       he's blowing up the GOP, he's destroying Clear Channel, even while
       he's losing audience.  And what does he do? he doubles down.
       Amazing.   Just yesterday: "just exactly as the news media is a
       branch of the Democrat party.. so is much of science."
       For such seminal statements like this, that flow out and become the

   Rush doesn't really have any kind of batshit rightwing superpower -
   unless you count being a raging asshole.  But that isn't a skill unique
   to him.

   Bachmann on the other hand has a special talent.  It is hard to put it
   into words, but she is the real deal when it comes to RWNJ batshit.
   She has to be the betting favorite at this point.

       asylum who leaped to the helm of the TP at a propitious moment and
       steers them on a chronic hard right trying to make her mark in
       water circles rather than crop circles.  She lives in fear that
       Obamacare with its mental health coverage will enable the folks
       with the white coats and metal mesh gloves to take her in for
       observation.
       It's amazing that Bachmann can sustain her mania without drooling
       or biting bystanders.  I admire that in a nutball.

   I just don't buy the idea that Bachman's crazy but Limbaugh is just
   calculating, or performing.

   The destructive sickness that he has inflicted on this country, and its
   political system, for most of the last three decades has, at its core,
   Rush's own uncontrolled narcissism, paranoia, megalomania and
   sociopathy.

   His career has been a successful venture in attempting to normalize his
   antisocial diseases within the conservative movement, and the
   Republican party, and to encourage others to express and celebrate
   their own destructive pathologies.

   The GOP would not be the insane asylum that it is today without the
   overwhelming influence of Rush Limbaugh.

       Rush Limbaugh is evil, he is cold, he is calculating, he is a
