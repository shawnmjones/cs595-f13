   Today's source material is a real eye-roller:
   Breitbart.com screenshot of story with headline

     While conservatives and liberals consider the political leanings of
     Washington Post buyer and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in an attempt to
     divine how his politics will affect those of the historic
     institution, the truth appears to be far simpler: the Post is now
     Bezos' latest political tool in a crony capitalist effort to work
     with the Obama administration. How else to explain President Obama
     puzzling decision last week to roll out his corporate tax plan at an
     Amazon.com fulfillment center?

   The only explanation for Obama announcing his plan at an Amazon
   facility was that it gave an opportunity for Bezos and Obama to hatch
   their secret and nefarious plot to take over the Post. Of course, they
   could've done that without the public event. Bezos could've visited the
   White House to work out the details of their coup. They could've
   skyped. But oops, Obama slipped and had that whole public event happen
   by accident, and BAM the Breitbarts exposed the entire scheme!

   You can only imagine how excited the Breitbarters are at this explosive
   expose! Some samples, below the fold.

     Does anyone have any doubt anymore where the : Herman Cain mistress
     story originated or the Perry Racist rock or the Romney 47% stories
     originated. The new rule of law is, we know every breath you have
     ever taken, you play or you pay. That includes every elected leader,
     every CEO. Compliments of Obama's IRS and NSA.

   1) From Herman Cain's mistresses

   2) From the dude who recorded the event surreptitiously

   They were all employees of the NSA, apparently.

     IRS visits OBAMA just before they attack conservatives too.
     must be a trend here.

   Crazy. That's the trend.

     Obviously Obama thought nobody would what happened remember 6 days
     ago. Well I got news for you Obama, we have memories 7 whole days
     long. You really screwed up. Had you waited a day nobody would have
     suspected a thing.

   Had it been EIGHT days, it would've been beyond the intellectual
   capacity of Republicans to invent a conspiracy.

     The President loves sucking the sex units of white billionaire
     liberals. The little Narcissist in Chief is the Hugo Chavez of North
     America. He does what Marxist narcissist do.

   Marxist narcissists love to fellate successful capitalists?

     Bezos bought WaPo to save face. At the AlphaGoof's request.
     AlphaGoof gave Bezos military contracts to reimburse Bezos the 250
     million he paid for WaPo. If Bezos is a good little doggie, there
     will be more lucrative contracts.
     The alternative was to shutter WaPo forever.

   Dear god, would a hint of logic kill these guys?

   1. Bezos bought WaPo to save face. From what? Who knows!
   2. Actually, he bought it because Obama asked him to.
   3. Obama gave Bezos military contracts to ... buy DVDs with Amazon
   Prime? Or are we throwing Kindles at terrorists these days?
   4. Bezos needs to kiss but to sell more terrorist-slaying Kindles.
   5. ... otherwise, the Washington Post shuts down.

     Looks like it high time we start an investigation as to whether or
     not we should begin impeachment proceedings against the AlphaGoof.
     Mr. Speaker...is there a motion on the floor?

   Yes! There was this time Obama went and made a speech, and then this
   other guy went and bought a paper. HAS HE NO SHAME????!!1!

     Everything is planned. Everything. The only surprise is that you are
     surprised. If he does something, dig deeper to uncover the agenda.

   If some dude takes a shit in Kansas, it was planned. EVERYTHING!

     Remember, this president does NOTHING impromptu.........he doesn't
     know how......just like he can't speak without his teleprompter; he
     can't present any plan of consequence without his handlers'
     approval(s)......

   He plans his major policy rollouts IN ADVANCE? Can we just impeach this
   bozo already?

     That clinches it. I've made my last purchase from Amazon. CDUniverse
     will do just fine.

   What's a "CD"?

     Good God, The entire Obama administration is running a racket, a
     money ring and DoucheRATS are knee deep in it aswell!
     ........................... We need to demand that Republicans use
     every law at their disposal to prosecute these Chicago style
     Criminals. Come on GOP get of your useless rears and grow a spine or
     out with you!

   Why oh why won't Republicans prosecute Obama for having an event at
   some place owned by a guy who then bought a newspaper? If there isn't a
   law against that, there should be.

     Wait for it...3...2...1...BOOM!

     Total CENSORSHIP of anti-Obama and anti-Prog literature coming soon
     to Amazon.com! COMPLETE MANIPULATION of Amazon's Top-Ten "Best
     Sellers" list! Promotion of Baracka Flacka Flamer's memoirs, and
     immediate BlackWashing of his [ahem!] "legacy"...Benghazi--what?
     Reggie Love--who? $500Million Phantom Green Jobs--where?

     And to Jeff Bezos? An early Hanukkah gift in the form of a corporate
     two-fer:

     1. a juicy, FAT, AMERICAN TAXPAYER-PAID, IRS-AUTHORIZED, TAX CREDIT
     to Amazon's SUPER-TURGID, off-shore, BVI CASH ACCOUNT; and

     2. an IMMEDIATE WAIVER FROM OBAMACARE!

     YAY CRONY-STATISM!!!!! ALL HAIL THE AMERIKKKAN MAHDI!

   That's A LOT of shit that won't happen!

     I got one of those Amazon Fire's and now every time I go to use it
     the first thing that comes up is Odumbo at Amazon. I'm seriously
     considering throwing the dam thing against the concrete. The problem
     is if you want a pad what do you buy that doesn't lean toward
     Odumbo?

   Conservatives can't build cool shit, so yeah, you're shit out of luck.
   But don't let that stop you from a principled stand against libtard
   companies! Boycott them all. Stick with carrier pigeons.

     Such a sneaky, self serving lot. Wouldn't it be nice to have someone
     we could respect and trust in the WH. So now he has folks buying
     Newspapers for him. I have 18 dollars left on an Amazon gift cert.
     When that's gone, bye.

   I wonder what Obama is going to do with that shiny new newspaper that
   Bezos didn't buy for him?

     The question is often raised asked why Conservatives don't purchase
     a major network or newspaper. The liberals have a stranglehold on
     the media and will not let the properties pass into enemy hands, no
     matter how worthless the property. Simple as that. Witness only
     recently WAPO to Amazon, MSNBC to Comcast and Al Gore's network to
     Al Jazeerra.

   When oh when oh when will someone maybe named, oh I don't know, Rupert
   Murdoch or Roger Ailes, do something about the total lack of
   conservative media?


     Once again, the middle finger and a big F*ck you to the American
     people from the thugs running the show.

     Well here is my middle finger to Amazon, you just lost a customer.

   I hear there's a place that still sells CDs, so you're cool.

     It seems that Jeff Bezos learned the wrong lessons about freedom and
     liberty from his Cuban stepfather.

   Freedom and liberty means never buying a newspaper after the President
   of the United States visits one of your facilities, leading
   conservatives to invent crazy new conspiracies. How many times did
   Bezos' Cuban stepfather try to get that message across?

     This smells like the Soviet Union under Stalin, Nazi Germany under
     Adolf Hitler or China under Mao where businesses must clear their
     ideas with "dear leader" or they don't get done. Obama is leading
     some of you down that path and I pray you awaken soon. Start by
     getting the Judicial Watch scandal on how Obama, Holder, Napolitano
     and John Morton have secretly finagled www.Judicial Watch.org
     The noose tightens around Obama and his administration if we only
     had a journalist to arise goodbye Barry.

   This made up scandal is like some other made up scandal (which I
   googled and couldn't find anything about), which means he's just like
   Hitler and must be lynched. Which, in reality, is pretty much the
   summary of every other comment featured here.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [42]Tagging tips - [43]Search For Tags - [44]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   For a politician to stay bought you have to find an honest one. Not
   sure how to tell in advance whether you have one or not. Perhaps you
   tap the head and listen to the sound? Is honest denoted by a muffled
   "thunk" or a hollow "bap"? Can't remember!

   Meanwhile, the number of people who have renounced their citizenship
   this past year? 1,800.  Out of 300 million.  OMG, crisis!!!!
