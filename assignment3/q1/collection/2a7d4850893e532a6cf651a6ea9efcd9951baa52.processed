LePage can't help himself

   Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R), a Tea Party favorite known for using
   intemperate and offensive language, delivered a speech over the weekend
   on the Supreme Court's health care ruling. Referencing the individual
   mandate, which his own party came up with, the far-right governor
   [3]said, "We the people have been told there is no choice. You must buy
   health insurance or pay the new Gestapo -- the I.R.S."

   Yesterday, LePage issued a statement saying "the use of the word
   Gestapo has clouded my message." But when a local reporter at WMTW
   asked the governor for comment in person yesterday, [4]LePage didn't
   exactly sound contrite.

   For those who can't watch clips online, LePage initially scoffed at the
   notion that anyone would be offended by his comparison of U.S.
   officials to the Gestapo, but when pressed further, the Republican
   added, "It was never intended to offend anyone and if someone's
   offended, then they ought to be goddamn mad at the federal government."

   Asked if that constituted an apology, LePage walked away.

   I guess we can add this to LePage's greatest-hits collection, which
   also includes a debacle over a labor mural, a push to roll back Maine's
   child-labor laws, tax cuts for the rich, and a pointless fight with the
   state's chapter of the NAACP.

   A year ago, several Republican state legislators expressed
   "[7]discomfort and dismay" with some of the governor's antics, but
   LePage doesn't appear eager to clean up his act.

   Because nothing says "reasonable" like comparing people you don't like
   to Nazis. Until the IRS starts adding gas chambers to its local
   offices, GTFO you Tea Bag asshats.

   [22]No, Romney Didn't Leave Bain in 1999 | TPM Editors Blog

     A central element of this campaign cycle has become just when Mitt
     Romney left Bain Capital. The Romney campaign says he left in 1999
     -- in time to get him off the hook for some controversial
     investments. Factcheck.org backs up Mitt while [23]David Corn and
     the Obama campaign have brought forward numerous pieces of
     documentary evidence saying he didn't leave until a couple years
     later.

     Now here's even more evidence that he didn't leave in 1999 as he now
     claims.

     The gist of the disagreement comes down to this: There's no question
     that numerous public filings and some press references say Romney
     was still running things at Bain after 1999. But his campaign
     insists that whatever securities filings may have said, in practice,
     he was so busy running the 2002 Winter Olympics that he actually had
     no role at Bain after early 1999. That's certainly possible in
     theory. But there's no evidence for it besides self-interested
     claims by Romney. And there's plenty of documentary evidence to the
     contrary. What you tell the SEC is really supposed to be true.

     But here's the thing. I've found yet more instances where Romney
     made declarations to the SEC that he was still involved in running
     Bain after February 1999. To the best of my knowledge, no one has
     yet noted these.

     The documents go into different aspects of Romney's ownership of
     various Bain and Bain related assets. But in both Romney had to say
     what he currently did for a living.

     Here are two SEC filings from [24]July 2000 and [25]February 2001 in
     which Romney lists his "principal occupation" as "Managing Director
     of Bain Capital, Inc."

     Romney's argument is that it doesn't matter what he said on these
     SEC filings. Even though he said he was running Bain, he really
     wasn't. He was really running the Olympics and didn't have any role
     at Bain. But absent of any evidence, how is it that anyone can be
     expected to disregard what Mitt actually told the SEC at the time?

   Mitt's defense will be that everyone knows he never means what he says
   and flip-flops on everything. In other words, the SEC knew, or should
   have known, that he was lying, and should have disregarded what he
   said. (NO, dammit; I am not the ghost of Joseph Heller.)

   The problem is not that LePage compared someone to the Nazis, but that
   his comparison was aggressively malicious and a flagrant example of
   projection. Too many people act as though good little boys & girls must
   never compare anyone to the Nazis unless the compared people are
   ridiculously flagrant about it. The irony there is that overt neo-Nazis
   are adhering to and promoting a foreign ideology. The actual Nazis were
   rabidly nationalistic and xenophobic. The true American ideological
   heirs of the Nazis are not the neo-Nazis, but red-white-and-blue Proper
   Christian Patriots.

   The new low in standards for governor can be found in Christie, Walker,
   Scott and LePage.

   I'm betting they'll be one-termers...

   This Mainer is going to do her best to assist in making sure that he's
   a one term governor. I'm also going to do my best to get both the Maine
   House and Senate back under control of the Democrats.

   Apparently, LePage added the comparison after his spokeswoman had
   already written up his weekly radio address. Or, at least that's the
   story she told to the paper.

   Please, can we work any harder to mainstream the worst of humanity in
   this constant calling up of the demons of WWII?

   Comparing anyone to the process that took 6 million lives, just to
   score some political point is ignorant and asinine.

   And how many Americans lost their lives fighting against that man and
   his regime only to see him invoked as a common slur by people who
   refuse to understand the magnitude of their offensive words. Beyond
   childish...

   Tea Party members claiming that liberals are communist is the biggest
   lie of all time.

   Proof?

   [48]Conservative news organizations claim billion dollar military
   technology is being used to spy on corn fields, pigs and chickens.

   Why would any sane person believe total fiction?

   P.T. Barnum was the first person to exploit that phenomenon for fun and
   profit.

   [49]The Barnum Effect describes gullibility as a measurable phenomenon.
   Television became a constant influence in most elections during the
   1950s.

   [50]Few space alien abductions were reported before science fiction
   television became popular during the 1950s - the Barnum Effect is the
   reason this has become so popular that documentaries have become
   common.

   [51]Lower intelligence makes voters more gullible, and delusions are
   strongly associated with conservative beliefs for that reason.

   [52]P.T. Barnum used fraud to become wealthy because "There's a Sucker
   Born Every Minute".

   Dictators have been using fraud to convince voters to end democracy for
   millennia.

   [53]Conservatives are less educated. Less educated voters are
   susceptible to delusions, and delusions are defended using the
   following logic.
     * I am right because I say so or because someone I trust says so
       (religion).
     * A concept is so threatening that it shuts down meaningful
       discussion (brainwashing)

   [54]Health care professionals even recognize extreme racism as a mental
   illness that is just like any other irrational phobia, like fear of
   rodents.

   [55]About 20% of the US population has a diagnosable mental illness.

   Mental illness is a voting block that includes 50 million people in the
   United States.

   [56]Conservative media organizations are convincing that segment of the
   population to believe outrageous lies.

   [57]Marketing uses Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) to sell inferior
   products based on this technique.

   [58]Joseph Stalin used FUD to maintain control of the Soviet Union
   after it became clear that communism is a failed economic system.

   Now lets look at how this will end democracy in the United States.

   [59]Gold is the preferred currency of former communist countries, like
   Russia and China, where money is nearly worthless.

   [60]The Tea Party claims Ayn Rand as the ideological source of their
   beliefs, and Rand champions the use of gold for currency.

   Rand claimed to be anti-communist to avoid prosecution by Joseph
   McCarthy after World War II. But her beliefs about gold indicate she is
   actually communist.

   [61]The Tea Party is funded by the Koch Brothers.

   [62]Joseph McCarthy did not prosecute Fred Koch as a communist while
   the Soviet Union obtained nuclear technology from the United States
   because Fred Koch founded the John Birch Society that claims to hate
   communism.

   [63]Fred C. Koch created the John Birch Society so that he could safely
   dine with the leader of the communist world as communism made him
   wealthy.

   [64]Fred C. Koch spent decades working with Joseph Stalin.

   [65]Joseph Stalin created the Tea Party indirectly through the Koch
   family.

   [66]The ultimate lesson learned by the Tea Party is how to gain total
   control of government using the Soviet strategy of Fear, Uncertainty,
   and Doubt.

   Communism is the basis of Tea Party beliefs that are being popularized
   by Romney, Cantor, and McConnell.

   [67]Conservatives even used Citizens United to legalize ulimited
   foreign influence on United States elections, while claiming immigrants
   are a threat[68] to the nation.

   The entire basis of the Tea Party is a mass hallucination created by
   plutocrats.
