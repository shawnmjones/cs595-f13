   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Darwin the snow macaque wandered into an IKEA store in December
     * Animal services sent the primate to an animal sanctuary
     * Yasmin Nakhuda sued sanctuary to get pet monkey back

   (CNN) -- Ask friends whether they remember the IKEA monkey, and a few
   may nod tentatively.

   The backstory: On a chilly December day in 2012, a small monkey dressed
   in a faux shearling coat and diaper appeared inside the doors of a
   Toronto IKEA store.

   The animal appeared frantic, racing around the parking lot and near the
   store. It created quite a stir. Photos soon appeared on social media,
   with memes not far behind. A parody [42]Twitter account quickly gained
   thousands of followers.

   The story that emerged left the monkey's caregiver, a real-estate
   lawyer named Yasmin Nakhuda, in a tough spot. She had reportedly
   obtained the Japanese snow macaque, named Darwin, illegally when he was
   just over a month old.

   Videos on her [43]YouTube channel provided glimpses of the next seven
   months, in which she described how often he ate and how much attention
   he required. But after Darwin's public escape and appearance, she was
   fined and forced to hand Darwin over to animal services. Animal
   services quickly turned him over to the [44]Story Book Farm Primate
   Sanctuary.

   What happened to that IKEA monkey?

   Nakhuda vowed to get Darwin back and filed a lawsuit against the
   sanctuary. On Friday, a judge ruled against Nakhuda.

   [45]CBC News reported the judge rejected her argument that Toronto
   animal services staff duped her and acted illegally by seizing Darwin.

   The judge also ruled that Nakhuda purchased Darwin knowing that it was
   illegal and lied by later saying the animal was a gift, CBC News
   reported.

   Bronwyn Iler Page became Internet famous when she was first to
   [46]tweet about Darwin: "Umm saw a monkey in the ikea parking lot,"
   alongside a photo of the wistful-looking monkey in his tiny coat.

   She still has [47]posted on her Twitter bio, "I saw the monkey
   #Ikeamonkey." Judging from her newsfeed, Page [48]continues to post
   about monkeys whenever the opportunity arises.

   Attorney Kevin D. Toyne said sanctuary volunteers are very happy and
   relieved with the decision. Toyne said Darwin is making good progress,
   becoming a young adult macaque instead of a small child.
