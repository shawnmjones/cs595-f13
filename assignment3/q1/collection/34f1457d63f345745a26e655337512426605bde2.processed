   President Obama delivers 2011 State of the Union (Photo: Jim Young,
   Reuters)
   Watch it [29]online or on TV. Talk about it here.

   [30]6:15 PM PT: The president is now at the podium. Cute moment as he
   blows a kiss to the first lady.

   [31]6:16 PM PT: And as the president hands ceremonial copies of his
   speech to Speaker Boehner and Vice President Biden, here's the
   [32]text.

   [33]6:19 PM PT: Paul Ryan really looks unhappy he's sitting on the
   floor.

   [34]6:20 PM PT: The heart of the speech: "It is our unfinished task to
   restore the basic bargain that built this country - the idea that if
   you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no
   matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love. It is
   our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf
   of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise,
   rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to
   every child across this great nation."

   [35]6:22 PM PT: Obama points out that the deficit has been
   shrinking--more than half of his $4 trillion goal has been achieved.
   Now he's talking about the sequester and says the challenge is how to
   finish the job.

   [36]6:24 PM PT: He says Medicare benefits and Social Security benefits
   can't be the entire focus of deficit and debt reduction. "Now, some in
   this Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making
   even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare
   and Social Security benefits." He says Medicare costs are a long-term
   problem, but there needs to be a balanced effort to reduce the deficit.

   [37]6:25 PM PT: "We can't just cut our way to prosperity." The
   president then talks about his support for more reforms to bring down
   long-term Medicare costs.

   [38]6:26 PM PT: Obama even has Boehner applauding.

   [39]6:27 PM PT: I think some Republicans may have applauded this: "Now
   is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that
   encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit." I think they
   may want to rethink their applause unless that they are ready to seek
   more revenue from reform.

   [40]6:29 PM PT: President Obama has definitely got his swagger back.
   It's great to see. He's just sitting up there talking some sense.

   [41]6:31 PM PT (Kaili Joy Gray): New thread [42]here.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [56]Tagging tips - [57]Search For Tags - [58]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [59]Civil
   Rights, [60]Community, [61]Congress, [62]Culture, [63]Economy,
   [64]Education, [65]Elections, [66]Energy, [67]Environment, [68]Health
   Care, [69]International, [70]Labor, [71]Law, [72]Media, [73]Meta,
   [74]National Security, [75]Science, [76]Transportation, or [77]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([78]California, [79]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to
     combat climate change.  Yes, it's true that no single event makes a
     trend.  But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all
     come in the last 15.  Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods -
     all are now more frequent and intense.  We can choose to believe
     that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and
     the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak
     coincidence.  Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming
     judgment of science - and act before it's too late.

   What's wrong with America? I'll tell you. Everything Romney said was
   pre-chewed wads of cud from Republicans from the last 30 years and yet
   he managed thru a combination of racism and selling the (false) hope of
   riches to get 47% of the national vote.

 Here's the comments on "means testing" Medicare. ([1024]0+ / 0-)

     That idea is even worse.  Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term
     debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population.  And
     those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must
     embrace the need for modest reforms - otherwise, our retirement
     programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children,
     and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future
     generations. . . .

     On Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the
     same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next
     decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles
     commission. . . .

     The reforms I'm proposing go even further.  We'll reduce taxpayer
     subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the
     wealthiest seniors.
       Well, there you go,  Just six words--but that's it.

       would turn Medicare eventually into a totally different program.
       What concerns me more is that Medicare was a program for "all,"
       with all getting the same benefits.  Once you start making those
       with more, pay more, you have created class conflict in a program
       where it didn't exist previously.  This will totally screw up the
       program because those that pay more will eventually want more, and
       the doctors will eventually want to only see those who are paying
       more.
       Just great, introduce more class conflict into our system, and into
       Medicare where there was once equality among all in using the
       system they equally paid for.

       It is rather appalling that it dips "so low" in terms of income.
       From all that I read, this income level is considered  to be in the
       "working class" income range.
       Now, it is true, that except for the very first year, most folks'
       premiums will be based on their "retirement" income.

     Affluent Seniors Could Take A Hit On Medicare

     By Mary Agnes Carey and Marilyn Werber Serafini
     KHN Staff Writers
     Nov 13, 2011
     In the scramble to come up with a deficit-reduction deal by
     Thanksgiving, members of Capitol Hill's super committee appear to
     have one group squarely in their cross hairs: high-income Medicare
     beneficiaries. . . .
     House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has left the door open
     to asking wealthy seniors to pay more, and public opinion polls show
     support for the idea. . . .
     Current law already requires seniors with annual incomes of $85,000
     and above ($170,000 for couples) to pay more than others for
     Medicare Part B, which covers doctor bills and other outpatient
     costs.  In 2012, the standard premium will be $99.90 per month.
     Premiums for wealthier seniors will range from $139.90 to $319.70
     per month.
     About 5 percent of seniors fall into the higher-premium group now.
     President Barack Obama wants the share of beneficiaries paying more
     for their coverage to grow over time to one quarter of all
     beneficiaries. If that were the case today, people with incomes as
     low as $40,000 a year would be paying higher Medicare premiums,
     according to Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser
     Family Foundation. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the
     foundation.)

 Here's the actual policy recommendation that ([1107]0+ / 0-)
       the President made in 2011 to the Supercommittee.
       This is the policy change that Kaiser Health News is referring to
       in their article.
       This policy paper is from the White House website.  This is from
       the Health Savings section, Pages 35-43.  This specific policy is
       from Pages 38-39.

     LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS AND INVESTING IN THE FUTURE

     Increase income-related premiums under Medicare Parts B and D.
     Under Medicare Parts B and D, certain beneficiaries pay higher
     premiums as a result of their higher levels of income.
     Beginning in 2017, the Administration proposes to increase
     income-related premiums under Medicare
     Parts B and D by 15 percent and maintain the income thresholds
     associated with income-related premiums until 25 percent of
     beneficiaries under Parts B and D are subject to these premiums.
     This will help improve the financial stability of the Medicare
     program by reducing the Federal subsidy of Medicare costs for those
     beneficiaries who can most afford them.
     This proposal will save approximately $20 billion over 10 years.
