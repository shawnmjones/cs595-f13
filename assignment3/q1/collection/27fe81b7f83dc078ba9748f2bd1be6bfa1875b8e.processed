[24]Florida police chief: George Zimmerman is `a Sandy Hook waiting to
happen'

   Saw this when I clicked on [30]Raw Story and posted it because (A) this
   jumped out at me and (B) I tend to agree. I thought it was ominous to
   see it because this has been my gut feeling since Zman was acquitted.

     Steve Bracknell is the chief of the Lake Mary police department,
     which is investigating Zimmerman, 29, for allegedly threatening his
     estranged wife, Shellie, and his father-in-law with a gun on Monday.

     In an email exchange with a Lake Mary resident critical of the
     department's initial decision not to arrest or charge Zimmerman,
     Bracknell appears to agree with the writer's description of
     Zimmerman, acquitted in July of murdering Martin, an unarmed black
     teenager, as "a ticking time bomb".

     "Zimmerman is a Sandy Hook, Aurora waiting to happen," the resident,
     Santiago Rodriguez, told Bracknell in his first email, seeking an
     explanation for why Lake Mary officers did not charge Zimmerman.

     "Your reference to Sandy Hook ... I agree," Bracknell replied.

   The linked article is significantly longer and more detailed but it
   seems to me some professional law enforcement (A) exist and (B) have
   significant concerns that Zman is an absolute disaster waiting to
   happen. To me, this is law enforcement attempting to do it's true job -
   protecting the innocent from potential mayhem.

   The original story is from the Guardian. The email exchange is [31]here
   in its apparent entirety. The emails are in 'backwards" order, the 3rd
   email is presented first.

   A citizen in Lake County emails the Police Chief and warns that Zman is
   a "potential Sandy Hook or Aurora" and in the police chief's follow up
   email, done as a numbered point-by-point reply it is point # 16 where
   he agrees with the citizen's concerns.

   It also shows, again, what one (me) would expect from professional law
   enforcement actually doing their job correctly and detailing respect
   for the law versus all the constitutional violations we regularly
   expect and get from "law enforcement" in general, from the local thugs
   in blue to the N$A.

   I posted this short bit to bring it to your attention; I don't believe
   it is 'conspiracy theory thinking' to imagine the danger Zman presents
   to some poor soul or souls out there when he finally derails: it is
   simple pattern recognition coupled with the fact he literally got away
   with murder.

   [UPDATE] [32]AlterNet has a lengthy article up as well.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [56]Tagging tips - [57]Search For Tags - [58]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [59]Civil
   Rights, [60]Community, [61]Congress, [62]Culture, [63]Economy,
   [64]Education, [65]Elections, [66]Energy, [67]Environment, [68]Health
   Care, [69]International, [70]Labor, [71]Law, [72]Media, [73]Meta,
   [74]National Security, [75]Science, [76]Transportation, or [77]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([78]California, [79]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       George's wife left him the night before.  He was pissed at the
       world and took it out on an innocent kid.  Trayvon wasn't just a
       victim, he was prey.

       more than one mass murderer has engaged in smaller acts of mayhem
       prior to their outburst. Sometimes the attacks are domestic
       violence assaults. Texas Tower sniper Charles Whitman who stabbed
       his mother and wife to death before engaging in his shooting spree.
       The Sandy Hook shooter's first victim was his mother. So while
       Zimmerman may not fit into the classic profile, it's possible he's
       entered into a spiral of worsening behavior that could lead to more
       serious crimes, especially if he turns suicidal.

       Charles Whitman was a mass murderer with a brain tumor who
       expressed in his suicide notes the irrationality of his behavior
       and a desire for an autopsy to explain it. He did what he did
       within a span of 24 hours. Zimmerman seems to have a complex with
       no desire of understanding why.

       were more premeditated and deliberate than the Trayvon shooting,
       and were part of and immediately prior to the larger planned attack

   But not mass killing with this guy--he seems more likely to get
   involved in a more turf-oriented conflict with one or two people, or a
   domestic violence situation (again), but he doesn't seem like an
   alienated loner who will kill in order to get the world to notice his
   misery.

   I do agree something bad is going to happen with him; he's convinced
   he's above the law, and he may run into someone else equally
   narcissistic and gung-ho (gun-ho?).  At that point, all bets are off.

   I really hope he doesn't evolve into a mass killer.

   I'm just learning this now....perhaps this is common knowledge.

   I read thru the email exchange between the Lake Mary police chief and
   the concerned citizen.  In his email, the police chief says that he is
   aware that GZ punched his father-in-law in the nose, and that the
   father-in-law refused to press charges.  Though the police chief knows
   a crime has been committed (assault and battery), he cannot make an
   arrest without a complaint - no victim, no crime.

   In the same email, the police chief says he is aware that GZ grabbed
   his wife's iPad away from her and broke it over his knee, and that the
   wife refused to press charges.  Though the police chief knows a crime
   was committed (larceny, vandalism), he cannot make an arrest without a
   complaint - no victim, no crime.

   I wonder why Shellie Zimmerman and her father both refused to press
   charges after being assaulted, battered, and suffering larceny at the
   hands of GZ.

   Shellie Z. recently plead guilty to lying to the courts to protect GZ.

       You do know that Shellie also admitted she hit Zimmerman with the
       iPad BEFORE he took it right?  You do know that Mr Zimmerman was
       also assaulted and also refused to press charges right?  Not you
       don't because you, like most Liberals still cannot get it through
       your head that Zimmerman was found not guilty because Martin
       attacked him.  If you would even take 10 seconds to review to facts
       of the case you'd agree, but it's easy to many Liberal judgements.

       You are correct; I have not heard that GZ was hit by SZ.  This bit

       The Lake Mary police chief said in his email that he knew GZ had
       punched his father-in-law in the face, and that he knew GZ had
       destroyed SZ iPad.  But, the police chief made no mention of SZ
       striking GZ.
       Maybe you should share your new information on the case with the
       Lake Mary police.

       It is true that GZ was found not guilty of murder and/or
       manslaughter.  The trial did NOT prove that Trayvon Martin attacked
       GZ.  The trial did NOT prove Trayvon Martin was involved in any
       criminal activity.  Indeed, the defense made numerous ALLEGATIONS
       about Trayvon Martin, but none of those were proved at the trial.

   ...overwrought. That's not Zimmerman's style. More likely he'll get
   into bar fight in a state where people can carry firearms as long as
   they don't drink (uh-huh, sure) or road rage when somebody cuts him off
   on one of his speeding escapades and he blows a gasket.

   That he is a powder keg waiting for a lit match certainly seems to be
   the case. I wonder if the same cop who urged the Zimmermans to buy a
   gun to protect themselves from a pitbull is now advising Shellie to buy
   her own gun in case George decides to go after her again.

   even if it is illegal in his state. GZ does have a legit worry that if
   he goes any place with African Americans well bad things could happen.
   So I doubt he will go into any bars thankfully unless he were sure its
   all white.
   GZ is also the type to get mad if he were searched for guns before
   entering a bar any bar so that is bad news.
      Hopefully there are no all white bars in his area.

       Is, sadly, way more common than many realize.  The creepy and nasty
       and dangerous exes surface months and months - even years - later.
       People often come to the courthouse where I oversee which cases can
       have a summons or warrant taken to the judge for possible approval.
        Battery offenders in the guise of ex-boyfriends or current new

   saying George had punched her father and was banishing a firearm.
   Statements she recanted once police arrived on the scene.

   Don't know about Florida but here in Virginia she would be charged.

   I also agree the 'divorce' is a method of hiding assets from a civil
   suit.

 David Dean, (Shellie Z's dad) told police... ([1196]9+ / 0-)

       [1206]that his son-in-law hit him in the face.
       Of course, G. Zimmerman's version was different, claiming that Dean
       attacked him.

     A witness, identified in the report as Eugene Johnson, told police
     he saw George Zimmerman "very aggressively" reach for what he
     thought was a gun and tell his father-in-law, "Come towards me, you
     are threatening me." However, he did not actually see a gun...
       Since Zimmerman [1207]apparently destroyed his wife's iPad--...

     "...--Security video showed him apparently dismantling the
     tablet..."
       ...which she was using to videotape the incident there is no way to
       prove which of the conflicting accounts is the truth.
       No one who was not there can claim that they know what happened or
       who is lying.  The people who were there know, but have different
       versions of what happened.
       Re the gun:  as reported, not only Ms. Zimmerman stated she thought
       he was carrying a gun, so did "A witness, identified in the report
       as Eugene Johnson".
       According to the "blonde friend" accompanying George Zimmerman:

     ...there were licensed guns in the car -- but police have said they
     had no probable cause to search the vehicle...

   There is surveillance video showing that in fact it is GZ that is a
   liar.  For example he claimed that Shellie's ipad was smashed when she
   hit him with it.  However the video shows GZ grabbing the ipad and
   throwing it on the ground.

   Shellie's father's glasses were knocked off his face.  How do you think
   that happened?  They didn't jump off by themselves.

   Mark O'Mara, GZ's trial lawyer came to the scene and affirmed that GZ
   did have a gun.  Unfortunately the police never searched GZ's vehicle.
    There is a video of them admitting that.  We all know that GZ had a
   gun in his glove compartment when he was recently stopped for speeding
   - twice.  In fact, the woman who was with GZ in the vehicle later said
   that there was not one gun in the truck but TWO guns.

   So why should we believe or trust anything that GZ says?

   Furthermore, why was GZ at Shellie's father's house in the first place?
    He was not supposed to be there.  He just showed up to cause trouble.
    This is a repeat of his behavior the night he murdered Trayvon Martin
   when the 911 operator told GZ to stay in his truck.  Did he listen
   then?  No.  Instead he chased after Martin and shot him.

   What she needs is a clean divorce settlement and a restraining order to
   keep him away from her, or at least make the police take her seriously
   if she calls 911 to report that he's threatening her again.

   And the penalty for threatening to do violence to your spouse and
   father-in-law is not significant enough, in most places, to be worth
   the police or the victim's time and hassle.

   I represented a number of abused women (not just threatened -- broken
   noses, whatever), and we never felt criminal charges mattered enough.
   Neither did the DAs. Fortunately I was in a jurisdiction where the
   judges took domestic violence seriously in terms of getting a
   restraining order, and the police would then do a pretty good job of
   enforcing them.

   In NH, a restraining order in a divorce case automatically included --
   just as we'd hope -- surrendering all your guns. Florida probably
   doesn't do that, but should.

   no charges.  Its part of the abuse "thing".

   I read in the same article in HuffPo that talked about the Sandy Hook
   quote that the cops are still considering if they are going to charge
   George and or Shellie.

   Maybe the cops threatened her on site or through her lawyer about
   lying.  Zim had no gun on him when the cops got there, her dad's nose
   wasn't broken, the best evidence of what happened is in the smashed
   hand held.

   Her dad possibly could  get him for trespass, as the rent house is his

       Much is being made of the fact that Zimmerman didn't have a gun on
       his person when the police checked.
       But, as I recall, the police did not search his vehicle, so it
       means nothing that he did not have a gun on his person when police
       arrived.
       His lawyer said that the gun was holstered throughout, and he did
       not take it out of the holster.
       Since the lawyer was apparently not at the scene, he must have
       heard about the holstered gun from Zimmerman.

   Most people, when forced by circumstances to kill another human being,
   react with revulsion to the deed. This is one reason the suicide rate
   of American soldiers returning from the was zone is so high. Even the
   notorious Doc Holliday is said to have cried after the shootout at the
   O.K. Corral.

   A few find the experience morally liberating. They have broken the
   ultimate taboo, gotten away with it, and perhaps even been celebrated
   for the act of killing someone. And they like it.

   Zimmerman seems to fall in that second category. It is unlikely that
   Trayvon Martin will be the last to die by his hand.

   our society took to enable and then re-enable this obviously obsessed
   and unstable person.

   We begin with the stand-your-ground law that he successfully twisted
   into a bait-and-switch in which he stalked and murdered an unarmed
   teenager who was doing nothing unlawful.

   Then an enormous sum of private money flowed his direction to ensure a
   top-shelf legal defense as the over-matched state fumbled the case from
   day one.

   Then, of course, the fait accompli, an unconditional acquittal which
   set him loose to do what he may.

   So long as we live in a society that provides care and feeding to
   George Zimmermans, it's not a question of when will he becomes the next
   perpetrator of a Sandy Hook, it's when will the next Sandy Hook happen
