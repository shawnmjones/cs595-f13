[24]Resigned Heritage study co-author sad because he is so misunderstood

   'Oops'
   As near as I can tell, the takeaway point from Bryon York's piece on
   now-resigned Heritage Foundation thinker Jason Richwine is that it's
   all an unnecessary tragedy; this poor Richwine has had a career
   pockmarked by accidentally writing and saying racist-sounding things
   and sometimes accidentally posting them to racist websites and isn't it
   sad that he kept accidentally doing all that stuff [30]because now
   people are being mean to him and he's sad.

     Heritage expected that debate. What it did not expect was the
     firestorm that broke out Wednesday morning when a liberal Washington
     Post blogger posted an article titled, "Heritage study co-author
     opposed letting in immigrants with low IQs."

   That was the dissertation written with the constructive input of Bell
   Curve author Charles Murray. Then there's also the two posts to a white
   nationalist website, and then there's the panel discussion in which
   Richwine asserted that "at least in America, you have Jews with the
   highest average IQ, usually followed by East Asians, then you have
   non-Jewish whites, Hispanics, and then blacks." Fast forward to now,
   and Richwine is stunned that he would be "portrayed this way."

   It might just be me, but this situation seems to happen with some
   regularity. "Oh no! I accidentally have hypothesized that white people
   are smarter than other people, and accidentally posted a long
   explanation to that effect on a white nationalist website!" That seems
   to come up, like, crazy often for conservatives. It's second only to
   "Oh no, I am a staunch conservative family-defender but I have
   accidentally wandered into a gay bar and gone home with a gay man and
   now I am accidentally having sex with him!"

   Yes, yes, it's a tragedy that you keep saying un-"nuanced" things about
   brown people and IQs that makes you sound like a closet phrenologist.
   It's quite an oopsie that of all the places you could choose to have
   your discussion on whether Hispanic immigrants are a more
   criminal-minded group than others, you chose a thinly veiled white
   nationalist site run by crackpot Richard Spencer. Damn, that sure is a
   lot of unfortunate things that happened to you.

   You know what I think the problem is? I think this fellow hangs out
   with the wrong crowd. It's not his fault, of course, but studies have
   shown that young white conservatives are more likely to hang out with
   racist assholes than any other ethnic group. They seem to have a
   genetic predisposition to it. First they hang out with racist assholes,
   then they start writing intellectual-sounding papers on why white
   people are super-awesome, and before you know it they've run off and
   joined a conservative think tank.

   I'm not saying we should be deporting these guys or anything, but it
   really is a problem America needs to come to terms with.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       definition of the word "racist". Apparently claiming that an entire
       race suffers from genetic inferiority is not racist:

     Richwine knew he was in trouble the minute the first story broke.
     "The accusation of racism is one of the worst things that anyone can
     call you in public life," he says. "Once that word is out there,
     it's very difficult to recover from it, even when it is completely
     untrue."

       Maybe Richwhine should try to regain a sense of perspective.  I
       suspect that being subjected to racism is a lot worse than being
       (allegedly) unjustly accused of racism.
       But these poor, poor white guys just keep getting unfairly
       characterized as racist, all because of a few accidental things
       like saying some races are smarter than others and accidentally
       publishing stuff on white nationalist web sites.  I mean, really,
       couldn't that pretty much happen to anyone?
       And what's with all these mean, angry people of color getting so
       upset about a little thing like one Heritage study?  We all know
       what an unimpeachably unbiased source Heritage is, don't we?

        Recommended by:
                [235]a2nite

       is because he said so himself in his dissertation:

     Finally, as I emphasize throughout the text, nothing in this study
     suggests that immigrants should be treated on the basis of their
     group membership...Unlike Brigham's A Study of American
     Intelligence, there is no racial or ethnic policy agenda here.
       Except that Richwine claims that Blacks are 1.0 standard deviations
       [spurious precision] below Whites according to the American
       Psychological Association, or at the 17th percentile on average,
       and Latinos are between Blacks and Whites. Permanently. And
       therefore we should administer IQ tests to prospective immigrants.
       In which language, I wonder? And does this apply to all immigrants,
       in his mind? I don't think so.
       This is what the APA actually says:
       [236]"Intelligence: Knowns and unknowns" (PDF), Neisser et al. 1996

     The differential between the mean intelligence test scores of blacks
     and whites (about one standard deviation, although it may be
     diminishing) does not result from any obvious biases in test
     construction and administration, nor does it simply reflect
     differences in socio-economic status. Explanations based on factors
     of caste and culture may be appropriate, but so far have little
     direct empirical support. There is certainly no such support for a
     genetic interpretation. At present, no one knows what causes this
     differential.
       Here are some comments from Richwine's dissertation advisers:

 How about an atheist Jew? ([375]0+ / 0-)

   I've known a good number of people who describe themselves as Jews but
   don't believe in any god.  I believe a Pew poll on religion from a few
   years ago showed over a quarter of American Jews don't buy the dogma.
   Jewish identity seems more of a cultural/heritage thing than religious
   for many.

   out how, from a social science research point of view, things he says
   are completely indefensible.
   My example was the one you list above where he ranked groups in order
   of IQ -- that was prefaced by him saying that IQ disparities between
   races are real!
   He then proceeded to list a hodge-podge of groups that mixes race,
   ethnicity, religion, and god-knows what.
   Jews are a religion. Among Jews there are several different ethnic
   groups represented. Jews can be of any race (they are not a race).
   Hispanics can be of any race.
   East-Asians are what? Not sure.
   Race is a troublesome enough word as it is -- a social construct that
   has taken on complicated meanings and connotations. He makes the term
   even worse.
   A real social scientist would be far more careful in the terms they
   use.
   But then a real social scientist wouldn't make the kind of statements
   he did in his dissertation about the IQ of Hispanics across 3
   generations.
   And a real social scientist/faculty-advisor wouldn't have accepted that
   dissertation without requiring drastic changes and some intensive
   education of the author in the methods and standards of research in
   social science.

       a reputable graduate school could have accepted his dissertation. I
       would have been thrown out and told to start over from the
       beginning if I had turned something like that in (and I mean in
       terms of bias -- my bias would have been from the left, and it
       wouldn't have been any more acceptable than his).
       In fact, my first draft of my introduction to my dissertation
       included some of my political views and my advisor, who agreed with
       me politically, made me completely rewrite it.

       [489]How did Jason Richwine Get a PhD from Harvard?.
       [490]Richwine's Harvard PhD: The Committee and Dean Respond
       On the subject of dumb degrees from universities with good
       reputations. The numbers of BS, MS and PhDs in Colorado School of
       Mines 5/10/13 commencement for mining, petroleum and other fossil
       fuel industry jobs. The PhD thesis were quite deep into the science
       and tech. I suppose they will still be able to get some kind of
       engineering jobs when those fields start to decrease. Hopefully
       they will have their student loans paid off by then.
       My kid got a Mech Eng degree and a job to work on the design team
       for a major national manufacturer of wheel chairs. One uncle has
       always teased her about how much more she could make in the
       petroleum industry. In the video made for her grad party, he
       included the comment about she could change her mind from being a
       do-gooder to making real money... I proudly acknowledged raising a
       do-gooder, and she loudly said YES.  That uncle btw, is a CPA. The
       other is an Indus/mech eng, who has done a lot to keep her out of
       the bank clutches for loans the last two years. ;)
       Unfortunately, I suspect Richwine will continue to make a lot of
       $$$ on crackpot theories supported with erroneous spreadsheets.

   indefinitely, even though he has a PH.D. which makes him really smart,
   and then the media types ID RIchwine as a conservative and then the
   whole GOP gets blamed for being racist even when they are.

   And that is the fault of the media and it must stop.  Because, you
   know, Latino values are really very GOPer deep inside and it's not
   fair.

   And if only the Heritage Foundation message could have gotten out about
   one hundred years ago.  We could have sent all the Irish back and think

   This quote is important.  Per [809]TPM

     "It still amazes me that it would be me who is portrayed this way,"

     good background in doing very good quantitative work. The idea that
     I am some sort of foaming-at-the-mouth extremist never even crossed
     my mind."

   In the last week I have written two diaries calling out Richwine's
   committee for signing-off on his dissertation, for legitimizing his
   work.  I think this quote shows exactly why signing-off was a horrible
   mistake.  Richwine is already citing his 'qualifications' to justify
   his bullshit.

   Richwine does not have a history of "very good quantitative work"--it
   was crap.  But he does have a "pretty good educational background"
   because of three wankers in Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.

   This is why those three professors need to be called out.  They
   legitimize this crap.

 The lazy Mexican lie has been debunked ([909]0+ / 0-)

   Time and time again.  Numerous studies have shown workers  from Latin

 From Richwine's Thesis: ([921]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [922]Nailbanger

       Speaking to cultural and economic assimilation in America:
       "However, this optimism is unwarranted if the average immigrant
       lacks the raw cognitive ability, or intelligence, to pursue higher
       education and take on skilled labor."
       Outlining what his thesis will argue: "I show that the existence of
       general intelligence is widely accepted, that it can be reliably
       measured using IQ tests, and that it is determined partly by
       genes."

   Some interesting commentary now on the site in light of the Richwine
   affair.

   The editor, Colin LIddell sees all of history through the prism of IQ:

     Considering the seriousness of the existential threat, White America
     should be rising up in revolution, yet it isn't. This proves that
     the 100 point mark on the IQ continuum, which we can call
     semi-intelligence, is something of a passivity 'sweet spot.' There
     are two elements to this:

         A semi-intelligent population is rather adept at deceiving
     itself. It has enough smarts to construct elaborate and plausible
     explanations that miss the point and prognostications that defer the
     moment of truth. It melds enough inventiveness and gullibility
     together to make continuous denial relatively easy.
         A semi-intelligent population is also smart enough to work
     around and ameliorate the negative effects of serious flaws in the
     socio-political fabric. This is what is happening in America, as the
     intelligent, frugal, and hard-working portion of the population take
     up the load of the increasingly large and dysfunctional underclass.
     In a lower IQ society, this balancing act would already be breaking
     down.

   I hear some echoes here to Mitt Romney's "47%".

 A friend of mine graduated Waco High School 1965 ([955]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [956]Mokurai

   One time, he got drunk enough to tell me about a crew of guys he went
   riding around with while they were in high school.

   Waco, at that time, was rather segregated.  Rather an understatement.
   His group of friends had parents who were in positions of influence, so
   they never got in trouble.  This is the essence of the Jim Crow South.

   They specifically chose to drive around in the  black part of town.
   They used a baseball bat to knock mailboxes off of their posts by the
   road.  But every now and then they say some poor black person walking
   by the side of the road who didn't hear them coming.  They used the
   baseball bat on whoever that was.

   That was an attitude that was deeply approved of back in those days.
   It isn't so overt now.  Racists have learned to deny their racism.

   But these attitudes still exist and they are a special burden to the
   Republican Party, which has been pandering to these people ever since
   LBJ signed the Voting Rights Act, creating a lot of resentful people
   who believe their privileged status has been damaged.

   The entire exercise for the Heritage Foundation is how to pretend this
   isn't so.

   hope that the idiots who have no constructive and creative solutions
   but only look to tear down will not win the day.

 The odds ([959]0+ / 0-)

     there's the panel discussion in which Richwine asserted that "at
     least in America, you have Jews with the highest average IQ, usually
     followed by East Asians, then you have non-Jewish whites, Hispanics,
     and then blacks."

   I'd say it's a pretty fair guess that Richwine is among the group he
   proclaims to be the "most intelligent".  It's really not that smart of
   Jews to cozy up to white supremacists.  It's never worked out very
   well, odds are it won't be any better this time around either.   Grand
   Dragons don't change their spots.

   Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?

   by [960]ActivistGuy on [961]Mon May 13, 2013 at 03:02:34 PM PDT



 I'm not defending the guy, as I don't know ([962]0+ / 0-)

   anything more about him than what I just read, but it doesn't seem
   consistent for someone who believes average Jews and East Asians have
   higher IQs than his group - non-Jewish Europeans - to think "white
   people are super-awesome".

   Moreover, far too many scientists have become persona non grata for
   similar IQ findings, even when there are no doubts about study
   methodology. This isn't real scientific critique; it's political or
   social science, at best.

   Even from just an income perspective, East Asians and Jews make more
   money and are better educated than non-Jewish "Whites".  This isn't
   theory, but reality.  How could this be, especially when most of the
   East Asians arrived here just a generation or two ago?  Is this due to
   the advantages of systemic racism in favor of East Asians and Jews?
   Given our nation's history, I'm guessing not.

   Could it be family and cultural values that lead children towards
   academic success in spite of barriers?  Hmm.  Is there a lesson to be
   learned here by other groups who aren't fairing as well?
