[22]Sunday Talk: Not necessarily the news

   [rhid7c.jpg] In the [29]hours and days following the [30]Boston
   Marathon bombing, several media outlets distinguished themselves--and
   [31]not in a good way.

   Leading the pack was [32]The New York Post and its editor, Col Allen,
   who is said to be a [33]bigoted drunk pig-fucker.

   Shortly after the blasts occurred, the tabloid [34]falsely claimed that
   12 people had been killed and a [35]Saudi national was in custody; and
   then, to add insult to injury, they ran a [36]front page photo which
   [37]libelously depicted a [38]high school track star as a
   federally-sought suspect.

   [39]The Post then continued to [40]stand [41]by its reporting long
   after it had been proven wrong.

   Meanwhile, on [42]CNN, [43]Wolf Blitzer and the "best political team on
   television" [44]once again found themselves unable to keep up with
   a [45]breaking news story that doesn't involve a [46]poop ship--and
   they were subsequently [47]commended by their boss for it.

   And lest you think the [48]shit show was [49]confined to old media,
   allow me to disabuse you of [50]that notion.

   On popular websites like [51]Reddit and 4Chan, [52]amateur detectives
   conducted a [53]crowdsourced investigation which [54]wrongly [55]named
   a [56]missing college student as the [57]wanted culprit; but that
   didn't stop them from [58]congratulating themselves on their sleuthing.

   Bottom line: When faced with a rapidly-evolving situation, it's
   probably [59]best to heed [60]Karl Rove's advice and wait until all of
   the facts are in before calling [61]the race.

   Morning lineup:

   Elsewhere...

   A Tennessee state Senator [74]officially congratulated himself on a job
   well done. [2ibjnk8.png]

     A Tennessee legislator is catching heat for passing a resolution to
     honor himself.

     While Tennessee lawmakers have long been criticized for wasting time
     and money on frivolous bills, some say this one tops them all. [...]

     "I think it's important for us as a state to say, 'Hey, great job on
     creating jobs and moving the ball forward,'" said Lundberg,
     R-Bristol.

     Lundberg's resolution, written by his own staff, honors his public
     relations firm, The Corporate Image, and says things like "the
     owners and employees of The Corporate Image are many such noteworthy
     persons" and "the company has continued to set the standard for the
     highest quality professional services."

   Meanwhile...

   George W. Bush, whose presidential library opens this week, [75]looked
   back fondly on the decisions he made during an interview with The
   Dallas Morning News. [s6uck5.png]

     Near the Iraq war's 10th anniversary -- as many stepped forward to
     revisit their criticism of the conflict -- Bush made no mention of
     weapons of mass destruction, "enhanced interrogation techniques" or
     other controversies. [...]

     "It's easy to forget what life was like when the decision was made,"
     Bush said.

     Since he left office, Bush has been a punching bag for Obama,
     Democrats and even some Republicans. But while he said "nobody likes
     to be criticized all the time," he brushed aside the constant
     pummeling.

     "I'm comfortable with what I did," he said. "I'm comfortable with
     who I am."

     Bush's confidants said that's real talk, too.

   And, in other news...

   Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) [76]huffed and puffed about an imaginary
   motorized windmill. [2n1ax5u.png]

     "Now, to add insult to injury, The University of Maine, Presque Isle
     -- anybody here been up there to see that damn windmill in the back
     yard? Guess what, if it's not blowing wind outside and they have
     somebody visiting the campus, they have a little electric motor that
     turns the blades. I'm serious. They have an electric motor so they
     can show people that wind power works. Unbelievable. And that's the
     government that you have here in the state of Maine."

     Asked about this curious claim, the University spokesperson's first
     response was to literally laugh out loud. There is no motor.

   Ain't that the truthiness.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [87]Tagging tips - [88]Search For Tags - [89]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [90]Civil
   Rights, [91]Community, [92]Congress, [93]Culture, [94]Economy,
   [95]Education, [96]Elections, [97]Energy, [98]Environment, [99]Health
   Care, [100]International, [101]Labor, [102]Law, [103]Media, [104]Meta,
   [105]National Security, [106]Science, [107]Transportation, or
   [108]White House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding
   the state ([109]California, [110]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though,
   that there are many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in
   any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       We've added [229]a whopping 3,201 more users in the last two days.
        This is a continuation going back to May where we've been
       absolutely flooded with new users.  I'm pretty sure almost all of
       these new users are spammers or bots.  While the rate had been
       getting faster, it seems they suddenly started slowing down right
       when Hurricane Sandy hit.  It slowed down to under 1,000 new users
       in a 24-hour period, and we were back down to somewhat over 100 new
       users every 24 hours or so, until about January 30th, when it
       exploded again.  What are they [230]planning?

   We have a beaver beach, a bear patio, a market panda, some trout geese,
   a trout tax to go with the trout geese, a panty goose (intriguing!),
   nylon Lisa (are she and panty-goose together?), a red bill, a buffet
   crab, some rat dew (that sounds gross), and a llama libra. What an
   interesting set of zoo themed spammers or users we have added recently.

       Big sandy area next to a river with a big beaver dam.
       That dam created a nice fishing hole.
       Slept under the stars. Well, I'm not sure the beagle did. I think

       His father Mario was a very good governor in New York some decades
       ago. The current governor Andrew Cuomo isn't so great. But CNN's
       Chris Cuomo makes my skin crawl for some reason. He comes off as
       very condescending and phony. Not that most newscasters aren't
       phony, but Chris Cuomo is so transparent you can almost see the
       green screen behind him while he's on the air.

       when I got home from Asheville I took a 2 hour nap.
       Very happy the week in Boston is over.
       I was at Micky D's eating a burger & I heard the TV say the younger
       brother killed the older brother when he ran him over during his
       flee from that first encounter with the police forces.

   [1054]this piece from a Bostonian about the bombers published earlier

   Lauren Miller, who was the digital media director for Elizabeth Warren
   during her Senate campaign, and is now working for Warren on the Hill.

       before CNN picked him up as a retread TV executive. This is an
       industry where SPECTACULAR failure can lead to further wealth going
       forward.
       It was Zucker's idea to can Jay Leno the 1st time around and
       replace him with Conan O'Brien, and this arrangement was set in
       stone 5 years before it finally happened. Leno was #1 in the
       ratings and didn't want to leave. Conan, while a bright spot in the
       late-late night timeslot was at times very funny, he didn't really
       have the chops for The Tonight Show and the ratings proved it in
       short order.
       This little fiasco cost NBC a lot of money.
       Now Comcast is on the hook for "Let's Get Rid Of Leno Part II", but
       it was Zucker who made that bad decision first. Zucker was also
       responsible for other failures at NBC; a whole shitload of them,
       quite frankly. He never paid the price.
       And now he's got a new gig. You can't screw up enough in television
       to get drummed out of the business, apparently.

   :) Excellent as always -- thank you!

   The evidence presented at your link certainly makes a compelling case
   that Col Allan is, indeed, an alcoholic, bigoted fucker of pigs.  Given
   the standards at the NY Post, it may well be that these qualifications
   are necessary to his being able to do the job that he does in the
   manner he does it, and are written into his contract.  I'd imagine his
   successor, should the Post ever need a successor for him, will continue
   the traditions of drunkenness, racism and pig-fuckery that help make
   the Post what it is.

     In a sweeping format change that marks the end of an era for the
     nation's first cable news outlet, CNN announced today that it would
     no longer air breaking news and would instead re-run news stories of
     the past "that we know we got right."

     The rebranded network, to début nationwide on Monday, will be called
     "CNN Classic."

     "Breaking news is hard," said the newly installed CNN chief, Jeff
     Zucker. "You have to talk to sources, make sure their stories check
     out O.K., and then get on the air and not say anything stupid. I,
     for one, am thrilled to be getting out of that horrible business."

     CNN Classic will begin its broadcast day on Monday, Mr. Zucker said,
     "with round-the-clock coverage of Operation Desert Storm."

   The NYT reports that the FBI interview in 2011 of Tamerlan Tsarnaev
   raised Homeland Security red flags and derailed his citizenship
   application.

   [1487]http://www.nytimes.com/...

   If the FBI check of Tamerlan Tsarnaev at the behest of the Russian
   government was thorough and indeed did not find anything wrong, then
   Tamerlan was radicalized/alienated only after that interview.  I'm
   wondering whether a feeling of having been profiled in such a way might
   have helped push him over the edge.

   Any thoughts?

       Especially since one is dead and the other is feeling a little
       under the weather ATM, but...
       What I want to know is why did the FBI choose to enlist the
       public's help in ID'ing the suspects when they surely have the
       facial recognition tech to have been able to make the
       identification themselves based on their existing files.
       All that did was cause innocent people to be erroneously made
       suspects by the public when, in a frenzy, they rushed to take the
       FBI up on their offer to "help."

   Too bad for him. He wasn't 'profiled' he was questioned based on
   specific information that came from another country. That's not
   profiling as far as I'm acquainted with the term.

   And if that pushed him over the edge then the FBI really did us a
   disservice by not determining he was potentially dangerous at that

   Stop calling the pro-gun contingency, "the NRA." That term evokes only
   a mildly hazy image of the profiteers behind this murky business.
   Refer to them as "Gun-Makers."
   It has the added advantage of being true.

       NRA-Gun-Makers, then.
       Because the NRA certainly has the best interests of the gun makers
       as their top priority, and gun makers like the NRA, too.

   Why do we keep saying that?

   Is there really a poll that says that? The only one that I can find is
   from Frank Luntz, known Republican maker of bad polls.

   Is there another, more reliable poll?

   I would hate for us to turn into an echo chamber like the Republicans.

 Watching media coverage of the manhunt ([1811]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1812]Trix

   was like consuming potato chips for 48 hours, straight. Most of us
   suspected, already, that it wasn't good for us; but it took that
   concentrated dose to trigger the body's retch response.

   Indeed, it wasn't just the CNNs, Fox Newses and New York Posts of the
   world that mucked things up.  The Associated Press and a host of major
   newspapers that use their "service" promoted the opinion of anonymous
   "experts" that the attacks were tied to al Qaeda, without any other
   justification.

   The thick fog of misleading reports made it hard for the public to
   pinpoint good information...information that might be vital to their
   safety during a rampage by armed bombers.

   Mainstream media needs a journalistic equivalent of Michael Pollan.

   made me think of the old adage, "A lie can travel half-way around the
   world while the truth is still getting it's pants on."

   That said, I was thrilled to turn on the news late Friday morning to
   hear the younger of the two bombers (the older one was killed by
   police) was captured after the hunt for them put Boston (and the inner
   suburbs) in virtual lockdown for the entire day.  It did my heart good
   to see the people of that area finally able to leave their homes and
   cheer that the manhunt was over!  I was grateful to the first
   responders that they did their job so well.

   This was a tough week, but we are tougher.  And we will get through
   this!

 Dan Coats (Troll-IN) says ([1832]0+ / 0-)

   "Let's not rush to judgment" as he incoherently rushes to judgment on
   Boston bombers and immigration bill.

   [1833]Coats: Put immigration reform on hold

     You usually end up with bad policy if you do it in an emotional way
     or in an emotional reaction...We saw some things post 9/11 that were
     enacted that if we had a little more rational time to think this
     through, perhaps we wouldn't have had some of the pushback on
     it...Immigration has a dramatic economic effect on Americans; it has
     national security implications," Coats said, adding that he believes
     it's important to step back "just a little bit" and put it on hold
     while dealing with legislation to address a "bigger issue" like the
     nations' deficits and debt.

     "I'm afraid we'll rush to some judgments relative to immigration and
     how it's processed so let's do it in a rational way," he said. "Just
     push it back a month or two...We're talking months here, not years."

   So if we had done Iraq and the Patriot Act and Guantanamo more
   carefully, we could have avoided this pushback? And what emotion do you
   think you are talking about, if not the fear that your lot ginned up?

   You know, with this sort of ongoing, ever-enlarging fail, what I want
   to see is the entire Mormon Tabernacle Choir facepalming. I would
   settle for Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Can I get an Antichrist?
