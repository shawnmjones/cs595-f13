   Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the National Rifle
   Association (NRA), speaks during a news conference in Washington
   December 21, 2012. NRA, the powerful U.S. gun rights lobby, went on the
   offensive on Friday arguing that schools should have ar
   Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the National Rifle
   Association (NRA)
   The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows almost [30]unheard of
   levels of support for the general background checks for gun purchasers
   as included in President Obama's executive orders (those orders are
   [31]here).

     Just about everyone agrees with the idea--about 9 in 10 gun owners
     favor background checks as do people with no firearms in their home.
     Independents (95 percent), Democrats (93 percent) and Republicans
     (89 percent) all support a background check for those trying to buy
     firearms. No matter where people live: in the South, the Northeast,
     in big cities, in small towns. Even members of the National Rifle
     Association favor background checks. Only 7 percent of all adults in
     the survey, conducted Friday though Tuesday, oppose background
     checks for prospective gun customers.

   The poll also finds strong agreement with one NRA proposal, with
   "three-quarters of those surveyed said more police and armed security
   guards would help prevent mass shootings." So the NRA has that going
   for them at the moment. Their continued over-the-top tactics, like
   their [32]latest ad focusing on the president's children, could very
   well end any of that support. After universal condemnation for the ad,
   the organization remains [33]belligerent and defiant.

     For its part, the National Rifle Association isn't backing down one
     bit. In an interview on "TODAY" with NBC's Savannah Guthrie, the
     NRA's David Keene opposed the kind of universal background checks
     Obama is calling for. Keene also argued that limiting gun magazines
     to just 10 rounds doesn't do much to stop a mass shooter. ("It takes
     a second to change the magazine," he said.) And he defended its web
     video that injected the Obama daughters into the gun-violence
     debate. ("It wasn't about the president's daughters," Keene said
     about the web video. "It's about how to keep children safe.") It was
     curious to hear Keene's answer on the magazine--if it's not that big
     of a deal then passing the legislation shouldn't be a problem,
     right?

   That's the kind of [34]logic dominating the debate from the gun lobby
   side.  Passing the legislation will be a problem if Congress, and
   particularly Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, [35]drags their heels
   on bringing it to the floor.

   [36]Please send an email to your member of the House of Representatives
   demanding s/he support President Obama's proposals for improving gun
   safety.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [59]Civil
   Rights, [60]Community, [61]Congress, [62]Culture, [63]Economy,
   [64]Education, [65]Elections, [66]Energy, [67]Environment, [68]Health
   Care, [69]International, [70]Labor, [71]Law, [72]Media, [73]Meta,
   [74]National Security, [75]Science, [76]Transportation, or [77]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([78]California, [79]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       One thing the Republicans will not accept is, these proposals
       aren't radical in the least, they're very common sense, basic
       measures. People get it, even if the NRA doesn't.

       6 and 7 year olds isn't a tipping point, then what is?
       If the NRA wants guards in schools (then we'll also need guards for
       playgrounds, before and after school activies, sporting evens, on
       school buses and outings, etc, etc, etc) then let them pay for it.

       Taxes and annual registration fees on all guns, taxes on all ammo
       purchases, taxes and annual inspection fees on all gun
       manufacturers, importers and stores selling guns.  Annual
       inspection fees on all gun ranges.
       Hunting rifles and shotguns would be exempt (except for the
       ammunition).

       is undoubtedly part of why congress is refusing to take up the

       opinion heard.  Each one of these new members is a citizen of this

 1. My comment isn't "screaming." I sound ([192]0+ / 0-)
       downright rational. Their response is paranoia, which IS NOT
       rational.
       2. There is some evidence out there that all this new membership is
       because they heavily discounted joining.
       3. There are causes and there are causes. Many causes "rightfully

       to try to do something about it." Some causes are just damned
       reactionary, towards a direction that doesn't further human
       progress, and I just can't support because of the essential
       irrational nature of the cause.
       This really noisy minority is vastly outnumbered by those that want

       which is taking us all off the rails.

     Ninety-two percent of Americans favor background checks for all
     potential gun buyers, according to a new CBS News/New York Times
     poll.

   and in the same poll

     Seventy-four percent of Americans, meanwhile, said that more armed
     security guards would help prevent mass shootings in public places.
     Thirty-five percent said armed guards would help a lot in places
     like schools, movie theatres and malls, and another 39 percent said
     they would help some. One in four said they would not help.

   Excluding that doesn't make it go away that although we have disdain
   for LaPierre - that the vast majority of AMerican also belive that
   having guards at schools would help prevent Newtown type shootings as
   well.

       I don't really think that's much of an issue.  The reality is that
       this country has been well trained primarily in the Bush years to
       accept this theory of security.  Many schools and other public
       gathering places already have armed security personnel, anyway.
       The main thing that gun safety advocates have to continue to stress
       is what we can do that is new or different from what we've been
       doing because that's where the problems are coming from.  Even if
       Newtown had had a security guard, the speed at which the shooter's
       weapon discharged rounds would have still left a lot of people dead
       that day.  At the theater in Aurora, 30 people had already been
       shot within 30 seconds.  An armed guard would not have prevented
       that carnage.

       100%.
       I don't think anything stops a crazy person.  The mere fact that
       millions of killing weapons exist and millions of high capacity
       magazines exist (Most of that we have no clue of where they are and
       who owns them) makes passing a law to prevent this just as
       effective as the guard - which is little or none.
       If passing a law kept guns off the streets - maybe we should pass
       them for cocaine and crystal meth....ooppps - they already exist.

       But I think the problem is that the widespread availability of
       these kinds of weapons and magazines is a result of not restricting
       them earlier.  After all, virtually every gun used in committing a
       crime was purchased legally at some point.  These types of weapons
       were not always present in such large numbers.  Had we banned them
       at that time, they would not be readily available now, and these
       shootings would be perpetrated by people armed with revolvers.
       So I think you're right that the cat's out of the bag.
       Nonetheless, you need to step in at some point and say that further
       evolution of these weapons is unacceptable.  Who knows what
       "assault-style" weapons and high capacity magazines will be like in
       20 years?  I worry that in 2032 we'll be sitting around saying,
       "Well, it's too late now, but if we had banned these weapons in
       2012 we wouldn't be facing them now".  Rather than addressing the
       current weapon supply, I think these laws are aimed at holding the
       line, and preventing us from having to face even more deadly

       We don't see those making appearances all over the country anymore.
       Your point is absolutely correct in the sense that we've basically
       gone to a model of zero safety regulation which is just too extreme
       and, frankly, ridiculous.  And where we do still have some legal
       framework in place, the laws are often not enforced.
       The lack of enforcement of existing law is sort of like if the
       police and prosecutors decided to just not pursue a high percentage
       of people who commit murder.  Eventually, the murder rate would go
       up because more people would feel they could get away with it.
       I really think that this country is on the precipice of becoming
       one of those countries in which life is cheap - or we could choose
       not to be - but it is a choice - it isn't something that "just
       happens" for no reason, IMO.

       Per the SCOTUS ruling United States v. Miller,

     the sorts of weapons protected are those "in common use at the time"
       The AR 15 and semiautomatic handguns containing between 11 and 19
       rounds are amongst the most commonly carried by police and
       civilians for the purpose of defense.  It is also important to note
       that these are NOT military weapons designed for the battlefield.
       They are civilian models that cosmetically resemble those for the
       battlefield.
       At a minimum without legislative action and based upon the above I
       think without at least a SCOTUS ruling (not just legislation), a
       ban is a non starter.
       If at some point in such as in 2032, the (civilian) police carry
       phasers or plasma rifles, then according to the present rules these
       would also be justifiable for carry by the citizens.

       The technology and efficiency of weaponry has taken off - and it's
       time to try and reel it in.
       My concern with laws and the false sense of security they can
       create takes people off guard.
       Of the ~32K deaths that result from firearms each year - more than
       half are suicide.

     Studies have shown that over 90% of people who die from suicide have
     one or more psychiatric disorders at the time of their death.
     Luckily, there are ways to treat and control these disorders and
     potentially prevent suicide.
       Here's the [262]link.
       Stonger background checks - eliminating loopholes in the B/G check
       process - can prevent a lot of these people from having access to
       guns.  Now there are other ways to commit suicide - but a gun seems
       to be quick and convenient.  It's too bad data isn't kept on the
       total number of suicides and of those committed, how many had
       access to guns used them vs some other form (hanging, medication
       etc).  Considering many who commit suicide don't really want to die
       - making it less convenient for those who suffer from mental
       illness not only protects them from themselves, but to others as
       well.
       This doesn't exactly address the Newtown type shooter - since the
       systems worked - he was just psychotic - and I have strong doubts
       that a person such as Lanza can be stopped by gun laws - we don't
       know all the facts of this persons mental state - drugs he may have
       been taking, if he had violent tendencies.
       I'm all for strick background checks (I think even the NRA is) -
       I'm for eliminating high capacity clips - I don't think tht a style
       of weapon is all that relevent.  If you ban assault syle weapon
       with limiting clip size - gun mfg will just produce larger clips
       for semi-auto hunting rifles - or rifles will be designed to get
       around the assault ban yet have the same capabilities.
       This isn't going to be easy - and really it shouldn't.  People have
       a legitimate right to own a firearm - that has to be balanced with
       everyones expectation of security and welfare regardless of gun
       ownership.

   that carnage.  What we do know is that he stopped when he was

       jammed after about 70+ rounds (out of 100) and that's when people
       around him were able to subdue him.
       Ironically, I think that he may be the only person in the room that
       night who would have standing to bring a lawsuit against the
       manufacturer of the gun and/or ammo magazine.  One of the few
       things you can sue the manufacturers for is malfunction.  Isn't
       that ironic.
       Anyway, in the case of every one of the recent shootings, the
       moment where a reload or switch to another weapon has been the
       moment where people have been stopped.  The moments before have
       offered carnage consistent with the number of available rounds and
       the speed of the weapons in discharging those rounds.  It is fair
       to make the speed of the weapons and the high capacity magazines a
       focus for safety changes.

 Define high capacity ([336]0+ / 0-)

     And, why the hell do the gun advocates need high capacity magazines
     anyhow?  Purpose?

   How many attackers is one going to face?  How many men does it take to
   gang rape a woman in a back ally?  What's more, how many rounds does it
   take to stop the threat?

   Collected information on 'stopping' power shows that on average the
   answer is at least two solid hits.  Someone who is drugged up may take
   a lot more because they won't feel the pain and unless you hit
   something vital that either causes enough drop in blood pressure or
   breaks a bone they can keep on coming.  Add to that in an extreme
   stress situation fine motor skills will go down the toilet.  This means
   that the ability to actually aim and deliver a bullet into a particular
   body part is almost nil. I have read that in 2005, the NYC police hit
   rate was 17.4%.

   So, lets say you have 3 attackers, which doesn't seem unreasonable.  At
   least two bullets each to stop them, with a hit rate of 17% (3 * 2 /
   .17) ~ 35 bullets to get the job done.  So who needs a "high capacity"
   magazine?  How about you, your wife, your sister, your daughter?

       What if there are 6 attackers?!  Then, you'll need 70 bullets by
       your numbers.  Holy cannoli, Batman!  So we really need to legalize

        But, an Uzie only holds 50 rounds.  Oh no!  An Oozie won't do by
       your numbers. Ahhh!
       But, what if there are 9 attackers?  Then, we'll need 105 round
       magazines.  Sure, a fully automatic machine gun might work. But,
       what if it doesn't and they're so damn heavy and what if there are
       MORE attackers?  My gosh, golly, gee, mister.  We'll need frag
       grenades!  I really don't see how a true man can protect his family
       without frag grenades. I mean come on, you pussies.  If you don't
       want to legalize frag grenades, you're a whiney little bitch.
       [341]This study from the New England Journal of Medicine clearly
       concludes having a gun in the home is much more likely to kill a
       friend or family member ie. your wife, sister or daughter than a

       As long as there are multiple attackers, you have clear disparity
       of force which is strong justification for the use of lethal force.
        Once your down to one on one, unless there is a size, gender, or
       some other obvious difference, you no longer have disparity which
       changes the dynamics and they better represent a lethal threat
       (meet the AOJ principles) in some other way.

       goes a long way to explaining many of the perceptions I keep

   --- then, why, does anyone need a larger capacity magazine at all?

   The fact remains that when you have a gun firing bullets many times PER

   fucking everything.

   NRA members?  An outrageous limitation that will seriously impact their
   ability to effectively bear arms.

    In 1994, a ban went into effect that made semi-auto assault style and
   big magazines illegal.  In 2004, the NRA successful killed that law.

     So the weapons ans clips used in Sandy Hook were there because the
   NRA wanted them there.  They have at least some direct responsibility
   for that massacre.

 1997 North Hollywood shootout ([472]0+ / 0-)

       IFRAME: [473]http://www.youtube.com/embed/ejD1Gml-ZGc

       [474]North Hollywood Wiki

     The North Hollywood shootout was an armed confrontation between two
     heavily armed and armored bank robbers and officers of the Los
     Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in the North Hollywood district of
     Los Angeles on February 28, 1997. Both robbers were killed, eleven
     police officers and seven civilians were injured, and numerous
     vehicles and other property were damaged or destroyed by the nearly
     2,000 rounds of ammunition fired by the robbers and the police.[2]
       The bad guys had all sorts of illegal stuff including body armor.
       The cops at the time were totally outgunned until a firearms dealer
       brought them something with some stump.
       Sure it's a wild exception, but where there is a criminal intent,
       criminals are going to do things.
       Amazing that with 2000 rounds of ammo only the bad guys ended up
       buying the farm.

       have no vote) did not affect at all what was used in Sandy Hook. I

   he asked me what i thought about all this "obama anti-gun b.s" ..
   since i am the designated "liberal" in my office, he wanted to know
   what my view was.

   disclosure - i am not a typical liberal..

   i told him that i think that the national conversation on guns is
   typically based on conventional wisdom, as-in false choices.

   my view is that any citizen has the right to own anything they want,
   including (in my opinion) insane weapons, as long as they are "well
   regulated", background checked, licenced and registered.

   further more, i told him that i think the right to own 'arms' should be
   limited to a persons private property and other designated weapon zones
   (hunting grounds and shooting ranges).

   this would exlude any public zones!

   just like the 1st amendment has limitations, so should the 2nd.

   to my surprise, he totaly agreed with me.

   so you see, not all NRA members are insane.

       than what is being floated right now. However, unless the 2nd
       amendment is changed, conceal carry in public is going to be law.
       The courts just forced Illinois (the last state without concealed
       carry) to make it legal.
       Also, registering all weapons would be hugely effective, but most
       gun owners simply won't tolerate it--I don't think a single one of
       our RKBA crowd would accept registration. I was compared to the
       Nazis and Taliban for suggesting it.
       With those obstacles in place, I think it is more prudent to limit
       access to the most dangerous weapons. It seems that is all the
       courts will allow.
       I would agree with your opinion here wholeheartedly if it were a
       possibility.

 The reason they fear the Gun registry ([641]0+ / 0-)

   ... is largely because of what would inevitably come after it:
   regulation.

   If the federal government planned to only use the registry for the
   tracking of fire arms, for ensuring all were purchased legally, keeping
   them out of the hands of known criminals, and  linking those used in
   violent acts with their owners/sellers ... I don't think the NRA would
   have as much of a problem.

   The problem is when the FED uses that list for things other then those
   listed above, once they know where all the guns are.  'Gun insurance',
   weapon bans, and other unpopular forms of regulation can only be
   enacted and enforced if they know where all the guns are, and this is
   why the NRA fights so hard against something that seems relatively
   benign for law-abiding gun owners.

   used it to collect any guns.

   They do use it to catch people who are buying guns legally and selling
   them to people who are not allowed to purchase.

   Unfortunately, Illinois, and Chicago in particular, are very close to
   Indiana which has very loose gun restrictions. For example, someone
   from Illinois can get a UTAH permit via the mail, then go to Indiana,
   who honors the Utah permit, and buy guns without registering them.
   Then, they can drive back home and sell them.

   If all guns had to be registered, then it would be much easier to catch
   people who were illegally selling them.

   Yes, a 10 round magazine can be changed just as quickly as a 30 round
   magazine, but when you have to change it 3 times to 1, yeah it can make
   a difference.  Those one or two seconds (or more if they've got to
   continually fish around their pocket to pull out the next clip) can
   mean the difference between a person or two making it out a door or
   around a corner to safety.  Those one or two seconds per 10 rounds are
   3 more chances for someone to tackle the shooter or to get away.

   These "it won't make a difference, so why bother" shitlicks are

 Machine Rifle ban ([692]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [693]Diane dp

   I was listening last night the a story on the machine rifle ban on All
   Things Considered. It was interesting that it was passed in liberal
   congress, but not opposed by the NRA because of tax previously imposed
   made such guns very unpopular.

   As far as I can tell the fee for a background check is only like $30.
   It makes me think of the huge amount of taxpayer money that is being
   wasted to build and maintain these databases of people who should not
   have guns.

   You know even when I buy a car from an individual for my private use I
   have to pay taxes on the price that the state thinks i should have paid
   for the car.  When a car is given to me I still have to pay a fee.

   So why can't we do this thing that was considered perfectly legal and
   rational 50 years ago.  Certainly we do not think less of the second
   amendment now that we did when everyone was running around with machine
   pistols?

   Tax all gun and gun accessories transfers at up to 1000%.  Use that
   money to build the databases .

   And if anyone objects, then consider the drug laws which kill as many
   people as guns.  These laws strip suspects of their right to a best
   defense, by removing assets and their right to due process by mandating
   sentence.  It is clear that conservatives believe that ignoring the
   constitution is void if it costs lives.

   What should be taking place at this point is a general public
   expression of horror and censure over gun violence. Legislators act as
   leaders in this process, in part by passing even token legislation.
   Judging from Australia, this kind of public attitude has a strong
   deterrent effect that even filters down to the violent psychos among
   us. Tragically, the NRA, along with redneck legislators and a complicit
   media (which thrives on 'controversy')  seriously undermine this kind
   of public expression.  The message becomes "well, too bad about those
   kids in Newtown, but we got to have them assault rifles or America will

   It seems to me that it will still be easy for the wrong people to get

   is allowed to buy guns--perhaps even friends.

   If you own a car, you can let someone else drive it as long as that
   person has a valid license.

   I like the suggestion that others have made of requiring insurance
   coverage. If one's premiums go up sharply if a gun is used improperly,
   then the insured gun owner would have reason to exercise prudence
   before letting anyone else use the gun. It doesn't prevent all
   problems, as a gun owner may well have complete (but ill-founded) trust
   in a family member.

 Koch brothers have told their congress critters ([755]0+ / 0-)

   to back off on the debt ceiling and focus on the March sequester.
   Following from Financial Times quoted by Naked Capitalism.

        A conservative activist group backed by the industrialist Koch
     brothers is urging Republicans to show restraint during US debt
     ceiling negotiations, representing a shift in position by the
     usually hardline Americans for Prosperity.

      The move by the influential group underscores concern that a
     political stand-off over extending the US's borrowing limit, which
     many Republicans are pushing for at the end of February, would
     diminish public support for sharp cuts in government spending, AFP's
     stated goal. AFP opposed an agreement that raised the debt ceiling
     in 2011 because it said the deal did not go far enough to cut
     spending.

         "We're saying calibrate your message. Focus on overspending
     instead of long-term debt," said Tim Phillips, president of AFP.
     "Focusing on [the debt ceiling] makes the messaging more difficult."

 Response from Mr. Miller of Florida ([769]0+ / 0-)

   In response to the recent tragedies, there has been much discussion
   regarding gun control, gun free zones, and the reintroduction of the
   assault weapons ban. Under President Obama's direction, Vice President
   Biden is leading efforts to end gun-related violence through policies,
   including an assault weapons ban. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a long time
   advocate for gun-control and author of the 1994 assault weapons ban,
   has pledged to reintroduce and pass her assault weapons ban that
   expired in 2004.

   It is important to keep in mind that far too often, we see attention
   paid to the firearm and not the criminal.  It has been proven that
   infringing on the rights of innocent Americans, as shown as a result of
   the prior semiautomatic firearm ban that expired in September 2004,
   will not end violent crime and put an end to all evil.  It is my hope
   that within these discussions, all factors that play a role in criminal
   activity is taken into consideration.

   I am a firm believer in protecting the longstanding American right to
   keep and bear arms.  Rest assured, I will continue to work hard with my
   colleagues in Congress to see that this fundamental right is not
   infringed upon and will remain opposed to any action that would
   infringe upon, revoke, or limit that right in any way.

 it's not about criminals ([780]0+ / 0-)

   the shooters weren't criminals. It's not about the criminals. It's
   about seemingly normal people being normal right up until they slip
   over some edge we don't see. And guns all around. And violence both
   heightened and downgraded at the same time. So we either learn how to
   see who''s "normal", on a continuing basis, or we decide that the
   choices available to "normal" people are perhaps too broad.

   Many gun fans point out that Britain, without guns, has a higher crime
   rate. Our gun homicide rate is 90 times higher.
   ([781]http://en.wikipedia.org/...) Our crimes must be special - maybe
   guns? And much of that so-called crime - pickpockets and street fights-
   I don't care about. Heck, I don't care about our gang shootings; I
   consider them all volunteers.

   I care about crazed people that desire public punishment and subsequent
   notoriety. I'll be magnanimous here and say that gun owners and crazy
   aren't the same thing, but we, as a society, can't let them overlap. So
   the availability, the trade and commerce of guns deemed dangerous must
   be difficult. For seemingly normal people. Reaching out for these guns
   MUST attract notice in proper areas.

   By outlawing all sales of certain guns, we freeze the market. Owners
   own, but are stuck with what they have. Since I don't believe
   pasty-white young gameBOYS have good links to an underground gun
   market, they will not be able to find many guns. I bet we can identify
   misfits through their efforts to find theses guns - since they start as
   misfits within a secure society and try to delve into the hastily
   created underground.
