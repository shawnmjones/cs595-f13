     * [32]Life Expectancy in Some U.S. Counties Is No Better Than in the
       Third World:

     The U.S. now ranks 39th and 40th out of 187 countries for life
     expectancy for males and females respectively. [...]

     The life expectancy of the U.S.'s poorest-performing counties is
     similar to the mortality rates of some of the world's poorer
     nations.
     Life expectancy for males in 11% and for females in 14% of US
     counties was below that of Nicaragua. In some counties, such as
     McDowell County, WV and Sunflower County, MS, life expectancies are
     lower than Bangladesh for males and Algeria for females.

     Federal crash investigators revealed Wednesday that the pilot flying
     Asiana Airlines Flight 214 told them that he was temporarily blinded
     by a bright light when 500 feet above the ground.

     Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety
     Board, said it wasn't clear what could have caused the problem.
     Asked specifically whether it could have been a laser pointed from
     the ground, Hersman said she couldn't say what caused it.

     Asked about whether the placement of the arrows was intentional,
     Bloomberg Businessweek spokesperson Rachel Nagler said via email
     "Could be up to the reader to decide...but we do take great care to
     be very precise when creating our covers."
       The story is about how the SEC rules now allow hedge funds to
       advertise for the first time in 80 years. The previous rule was
       meant to protect small investors. But who cares about them?
     * [36]Study: Modern abortion methods not linked to higher risk of
       premature births:

     The link between previous termination of pregnancy (abortion) and
     preterm delivery in a subsequent pregnancy has disappeared over the
     last 20-30 years, according to a study of data from Scotland
     published in this week's PLOS Medicine. The study, led by Gordon
     Smith from the University of Cambridge, found that abortion was a
     strong risk factor for subsequent preterm birth in the 1980s but
     over the next 20 years, the link progressively weakened and was no
     longer present among women giving birth from 2000 onwards.

     These findings are important as the current recommendations to
     discuss a possible increased risk of preterm birth if a woman has an
     abortion were based on studies before 2000. The current analysis
     indicates that there is no link between abortion and the subsequent
     risk of preterm birth in modern practice and so current guidelines
     may have to be revised.
     * [37]Toshi Seeger dies at 91. The wife of legendary singer Pete
       Seeger has passed on. The two married in 1943:

     As much as Pete is a consummate dreamer and optimist, Toshi had a
     strength and brilliance that was at least his equal. There's was a
     true partnership. Without Toshi's counsel and support, and always
     outspoken and direct opinions, it's clear to anyone who ever met
     these two remarkable people that, without Toshi, Pete would never
     have had the foundation and freedom to do the work that made him so
     legendary.
     * [38]New research: Tar balls from wildfires may be worsening global
       warming. Climate change is considered a culprit in the record
       number of wildfires because dry air, low humidity and high winds
       are going to be more frequent in the future and those are the
       kindling for such fires. Now it appears a product of those fires
       could be worsening climate change:

     Forest fires release carbon from burned trees and leaves into the
     atmosphere. Some of that carbon is released as carbon dioxide, the
     chief greenhouse gas. But a lot of it is spewed into the air as soot
     and clumps of black carbon known as tar balls.

     Soot doesn't necessarily warm the globe -- some if it can actually
     reflect heat from the sun back out to space. But tar balls warm the
     planet because they act like tiny heat traps, absorbing the sun's
     rays.

     The banking world is very grateful for Geithner's championing of
     their interests over the public's. Just six months after he left the
     Treasury in January, it has showered Geithner with cash. Deutsche
     Bank lavished him with $200,000 to speak at a conference in June.
     Private equity groups are also shoveling over piles of dough:
     Blackstone and Warburg Pincus paid Geithner $100,000 each for recent
     speaking engagements.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,

     Colorado Counties Want To Form 51st State To Avoid Environmental
     Protections

     At least ten rural Colorado counties are taking aggressive steps to
     form a 51st state, saying their interests are not being met by moves
     to regulate the oil and gas industry, increase renewable energy, and
     better regulate guns. Organizers in Kansas and Nebraska are also
     interested in joining the state they call "North Colorado."

     Organizers met this week to draw up boundaries of the new state, as
     part of an ambitious schedule to draft a ballot initiative by August
     1, and get a proposal before the voters in November. Congress must
     approve admission of a new state into the Union. But the U.S.
     Constitution also requires that secession of parts of any existing
     state be approved both by the voters and legislature of that state.
     This means Colorado would have to approve of the counties'
     secession, as would Kansas and Nebraska if parts of those states
     wanted to join. One of the ten counties that initiated the movement,
     Weld County, is larger than Delaware and Rhode Island, according to
     a county commissioner.

     One of the laws that movement representatives say "broke the camel's
     back" requires rural energy cooperatives to get 20 percent of their
     energy from renewable sources by 2020. The current goal is ten
     percent. While Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) signed the bill into law,
     he also signed an executive order committing to make an independent
     assessment of whether the 20 percent requirement is feasible, and to
     revisit the legislation next session if need be. The organizers also
     cite several failed bills to regulate the oil and gas industry that
     would have increased fines for violations of state law, and imposed
     other measures to address the fast-increasing number of both wells
     and oil spills and contaminations in Colorado over the last

       I want to know whether North Colorado (plus whatever else they glom

       support from other states.  I have a feeling they don't have enough
       of a tax base to support themselves, so they'd immediately be a

       mostly a drain on Colorado.

     New York Mets Cancel Native American Heritage Night So They Didn't
     Offend The Atlanta Braves

     In March, the New York Mets approached a local nonprofit group about
     organizing a Native American Heritage Night that would raise money
     for the group and promote American Indian culture. The nonprofit,
     American Indian Community House, bought a block of tickets to sell
     to members and other Native American groups. The Mets designed
     t-shirts that featured their logo adorned with feathers to promote
     the event. Organizers planned festivities, including traditional
     dances and singing outside the ballpark before the game began.

     This week, AICH aborted the plan because the Mets had "thwarted
     months of progress" and planning over fears that the event may put
     their opponent that night, the Atlanta Braves, in an awkward
     position, the New York Times reported Wednesday:

        The Mets, Osborn said, suddenly seemed "only to be interested in
     holding a Native American Heritage Day without the culture."

         Last Wednesday, a member of the Mets' group sales department
     e-mailed the A.I.C.H. in response to a series of questions from the
     group, which sought an explanation.

         "It was brought to my attention that we need to be sensitive to
     the Braves being a partner MLB team and can't put them in a
     situation for a potentially negative environment to be brought upon
     them," the Mets official wrote. "I know this is not the plan, but
     sometimes people come to events under different agendas than
     expected. I'm not referring to [A.I.C.H.] or any of the
     organizations involved, but more about unknown groups that may want
     to change the perception of the event."

   Where did you get that the Bloomberg cover story is about hedge funds
   being able to advertise?

   My understanding is that it's about the gap between truth and
   perception regarding hedge funds' ROIs, which is what the linked
   article says.

   And assuming that's correct, as a graphic designer/creative director, I
   think the cover conveys that point pretty well (albeit in a manner
   perhaps not befitting a "reputable" business mag).

   That doesnt seem to jibe with everything released in the weekend press
   conferences. How noone in the cockpit seemed to be concerned or even
   paying much attention to the landing until the alarm went off 7 seconds
   before impact. The one that says "YOURE GONNA DIE". They sure started
   to pull up quick then. It was just too late. Nor does it explain why
   the pilot ordered the passengers NOT TO EVACUATE after the crash. Sheer
   genius.
