[24]Prosecutor: Trayvon Martin is dead because George Zimmerman wrongly
profiled him as 'up to no good'

   Visual aid part of prosecution's closing arguments
   Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told jurors in Sanford, Florida,
   Thursday that Trayvon Martin was doing "normal things" on Feb. 26,
   2012. But George Zimmerman thought he was "up to no good." Zimmerman
   "presumed something that was not true," that the teenager on his way
   home from a convenience store was a "suspect," a criminal. "Instead of
   waiting for the police to come and do their job," de la Rionda said,
   Zimmerman tracked Trayvon and confronted him. Consequently, "a teenager
   is dead," de la Rionda continued. "He is dead through no fault of his
   own. He is dead because another man made assumptions."

   That was the beginning of two hours of closing arguments in which the
   prosecutor painted Zimmerman as a police wannabe who took the law into
   his own hands against someone he showed ill will toward by assuming
   Trayvon should be included in the category of "assholes" and "fucking
   punks," terms de la Rionda apologized to the jurors for using
   practically every time he did so.

   The defense will present about two hours of closing arguments of its
   own Friday, followed by an hour of rebuttal from the prosecution.
   Jurors will then be given instructions about the law and what charges
   they can convict or acquit Zimmerman on and sent off to deliberate.

   Aided by placards printed with color-coded timelines, slides and videos
   of interviews and a "reenactment" of the shooting, de la Rionda
   repeatedly told jurors "you decide" as he called Zimmerman a liar
   several times and challenged his claims he shot Trayvon in
   self-defense. Among key interrelated points, some of them re-emphasized
   throughout his argument:

   o Zimmerman's actions led to the confrontation with Trayvon. De la
   Rionda said: "But who followed who? Who was minding his own business?
   Of the two, who was the one who was armed and who knew that they were
   armed?" Zimmerman brought a gun to a fight that he started, de la
   Rionda said.

   o Zimmerman's claims to police that he was fearful don't make sense.
   The fearfulness Zimmerman expressed, de la Rionda contended, was part
   of a string of exaggerations used to convince police that he felt
   threatened. Among these were his claim that Trayvon circled his car and
   seemed at one point to be reaching into his waistband. "Why does this
   defendant get out of the car if he thinks [Trayvon] is a threat to him?
   Because he has a gun, an equalizer."

   o Zimmerman's claim of self-defense is bogus. "Is it really
   self-defense when you follow somebody?" De la Rionda reminded jurors
   that the defendant had taken a course in which the curriculum included
   studying the law in terms of self-defense. "So [he] knows all the
   bullet points needed to show that."

   Read below the fold for more from the prosecution's closing arguments:

   o Zimmerman used bad judgment. De la Rionda pointed out that the
   Neighborhood Watch volunteer didn't approach Trayvon and introduce
   himself and tell the teenager that he was behaving suspiciously and the
   cops were coming.

   o Jurors should not dismiss the testimony of Trayvon's friend Rachel
   Jeantel because of her lack of sophistication and education. Jeantel
   was on the phone with him when the confrontation began and said Trayvon
   had called the person following him a "creepy ass cracker." Said de la
   Rionda: "I had a dream that today a witness would be judged not on the
   color of her personality but the content of her testimony." And: "But
   did she speak the truth?" The jurors, he said, should think about what
   she testified that Trayvon Martin had said. "Isn't it consistent with
   the other evidence?"

   o The fact that Zimmerman called Trayvon an "asshole" under his breath
   was "not a description," de la Rionda said. "Why is he uttering that
   word, other than that is how he feels. [...] I would say that is more
   than a little angry: that's ill will, that's hatred." By calling him a
   "fucking punk," the prosecutor went on, Zimmerman indicated he had
   already made up his mind that Trayvon was a criminal.

   o De la Rionda noted that paying attention to what was going on in the
   neighborhood was a good thing. And that wanting to be a cop and taking
   criminal-justice courses, as Zimmerman had done, were also good things.
   But it was wrong for him to take the law into own hands, he added.

   o The prosecutor used snippets from taped police interviews with
   Zimmerman, the reenactment of the shooting and an interview with Fox
   host Sean Hannity to support his argument that Zimmerman changed his
   story.

   For instance, de la Rionda said, Zimmerman claimed to police that he
   was not following Trayvon but looking for the name of a street that he
   didn't know even though he had lived in the gated community where the
   shooting took place for four years and walked his dog there every day.
   The prosecutor says it was an obvious lie for him to say he didn't know
   the street's name.

   Zimmerman's description of the fight he says Trayvon started in a
   surprise punch to the nose also doesn't stand up to scrutiny, de la
   Rionda said, noting that Zimmerman quickly caught himself and
   backtracked during the reenactment with the police: "When I walked back
   toward him ... I saw him coming toward me."

   Zimmerman's description of the fight also makes no sense, de la Rionda
   told jurors. Zimmerman said that he fell backward onto the grass after
   Trayvon punched him. Trayvon then climbed on top of him, in Zimmerman's
   version, and kept punching him, saying "you're going to die tonight,
   motherfucker," as Zimmerman began screaming for help. At this point,
   Trayvon put his hands over Zimmerman's nose and mouth and went for
   Zimmerman's gun, according to his version.

   How many hands did Trayvon have? de la Rionda asked. And how did the
   teenager see the gun, in the dark, with Zimmerman on his back and the
   weapon holstered inside his waistband on the back of his hip beneath
   him. "How did the victim see this gun? Or is it just another lie that
   [Zimmerman] tells?" And, "He's holding one hand over his mouth, one
   hand over his noise and with that third hand he reaches for the gun?"

   De la Rionda said Zimmerman had told officers that after firing his
   pistol, he didn't at first realize he had shot Trayvon. But if that was
   the case, the prosecutor asked "What the heck's he doing holstering the
   gun?"

   As to the testimony of eyewitness John Good, who said he saw the
   darker-skinned, darker-clothed person in the fight on top swinging his
   fists at the person beneath, de la Rionda pointed out that Good didn't
   see the actual shooting or the blows hitting. And he didn't see the
   defendant's hands. "Did [Zimmerman] have the gun out? ... Was [Trayvon]
   trying to protect himself from the gun?"

   o If Trayvon was beating Zimmerman so badly, de la Rionda asked, why
   did the police and medical examiner find minor injuries to his knuckles
   and no blood from Zimmerman on his hands?

   o After the shooting, Zimmerman said he spread Trayvon's arms out,
   claiming that he was looking for a weapon. Said de la Rionda, "Why did
   he have to say that? Because it's part of wanting to be a cop. [...]
   Because that's what cops do." When the police arrived and found Trayvon
   face down, his hands were underneath him.

   To believe Zimmerman's version, the prosecutor said, jurors have to
   believe that Trayvon surprised him with a sucker-punch, that Zimmerman
   lay on the ground being whaled on and finally managed to pull out his
   pistol and shoot the teenager through the heart from a difficult angle.

   Instead, de la Rionda said, there was a fight in which the two rolled
   around, with the victim  and the defendant each sometimes on top. "But,
   again, why did this occur? What led up to this?"

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       or one of them.
       When both people feel afraid or wary of each other...as Zimmerman
       says in this case (and I do believe he did feel some fear when he
       was LOOSING a fight he started)...they both can be eligible for
       SRG.
       It's about feeling imminent threat.
       I kinda wish they pointed this out. GZ's fears were
       unfounded....ostensibly if GZ new TM was just a kid getting
       Skittles, unarmed, walking home, he's not have had any issue.
       While TM would still have been leary...white guy with a gun
       following him. Would have been freaky even if he knew GZ was

       But that's besides the point. The point here is that based on the
       evidence, the jury can make some natural inferences, including:
       1.  Who started the fight? Was it the much bigger guy with the gun
       and the MMA training who was following the other guy? Or, was it
       the smaller guy with no gun or MMA training and who wanted to get
       back home in time to watch a basketball game?
       2.  Who is more likely to start a fight, someone who knows he has a
       gun or someone who knows he doesn't have a gun?
       3.  Would somebody as paranoid as George Zimmerman--remember he had
       a gun, a concealed carry permit, two flashlights and a cellphone on
       his person, and he'd gone through extensive handgun and MMA
       training and who claimed that he believed that Trayvon was a
       criminal--let himself be snuck up on by a kid? There was a wide
       courtyard walkway with a sidewalk and no bushes near the sidewalk.
       This was why Zimmerman had to fabricate the story about looking for
       a street name for a street he'd been walking down for years.
       The natural inferences based on the evidence are there for the jury
       to convict. (And that's on top of the direct evidence).

       ... derailing Zimmerman's self-defense claim. It is ludicrous in so
       many ways, not the least of which is the fact that he suffered only
       superficial injuries and yet felt the need to kill Trayvon. Then,
       there's the fact that the injuries don't match Zimmerman's
       statements about what happened. The three-armed Trayvon, the
       continuous screaming unaccounted for in his time line, the claim
       that Trayvon went for a black gun and black holster hidden behind
       Zimmerman at night and on and on. If Zimmerman is unbelievable, so
       is his defense.
       So, that leaves us with evidence and the reasonable inferences
       drawn from evidence to show that Zimmerman initially provoked the
       incident, and after that, his self-defense claim falls apart from
       sheer incongruity at every turn.
       Finally, as a person who wrestled in college and boxed, I don't
       know how a much heavier person can fear for his life against an
       unarmed and untrained teenager he outweighs by 50 pounds or so.
       That's why they have weight classes in boxing and wrestling. There
       is simply no problem handling an untrained individual who is that
       much lighter than you.

   TM wasn't afraid. Listen to Rachel Jeantel's testimony.

   GZ did not claim "imminent threat" when he followed TM or when they
   re-connected 3 minutes later. GZ's claim of "imminent threat" was that
   after being sucker punched, mounted, pummeled for 60 seconds, then
   having his head repeatedly smashed on concrete, he felt "imminent
   threat" when TM declared he was going to die MF then reached for his
   gun.

       two flashlights and a cellphone with him as he followed another
       human being he claimed was a potential criminal, and who had
       previously prepared with MMA lessons, handgun lessons, obtained a
       concealed carry permit and who called police would have allowed a
       kid to sneak up on him in a wide walkway courtyard. That is
       impossible for me to believe.
       Jurors can make natural inferences from the evidence, and there's
       no getting around the inference that a paranoid individual like
       Zimmerman kept to the middle of the path and was on a keen look-out
       for Trayvon.
       The only other way to get around the inference is if Zimmerman was
       running after Trayvon, perhaps to tackle him, and Trayvon ducked
       him, but I bet you don't want to go there.

       That's when the physical struggle began.
       How can you possibly know what Trayvon Martin felt at each moment

   I support him from the stance of right to fair trial. I believe in
   being open minded and forming opinion based on evidence. I think the
   evidence shows many of his claims to be exaggerated or outright
   bullshit. There also seems to be some element of truth. The fact that
   TM's clothing was away from his body when he was shot surprised me.

   I can't put together a coherent version of what actually happened, but
   I think it's obvious that GZ's version has some pretty big holes in it.
   I was hoping we would get enough clear evidence to figure out what
   really happened. Unfortunately only GZ will ever know, but even what he
   "knows" may be screwed up by the side effects of the drugs he was
   taking.

   The State asked for an instruction based on the Florida statute on
   [628]self-defense by an aggressor.   The State argued that, under that
   law, Zimmerman could be the aggressor because he followed Martin and
   "confronted" him.  The State asked for the instruction on that basis.

   The defense, citing [629]Gibbs (a case I've cited here numerous times)
   argued, among other things, that to "provoke" Martin into using force,
   there had to be evidence that Zimmerman used or threatened force, and
   there was no evidence of that.  The defense said that, therefore, the
   judge should NOT give that instruction.

   The Court ruled that it would not give that instruction.

   That's a ruling that there's no evidence that Zimmerman "provoked"
   Martin into using force against Zimmerman.

   You will notice that the only thing BDLR said today is that Zimmerman
   "started it" by following Martin.  But he cannot say that Martin was
   "defending himself" or was "justified" in hitting Zimmerman, because
   the judge has already ruled that there is no evidence sufficient to
   make that argument.

       Zimmerman murder trial judge denies defense request on jury
       instruction
        The judge presiding over the murder trial of George Zimmerman
       denied a defense request on Thursday that jurors be instructed the
       neighborhood watch volunteer did nothing illegal in deciding to
       follow Trayvon Martin, before the encounter in which he shot and
       killed the unarmed black teenager.
       "I am not giving that instruction," Seminole Count
       Nelson ruled after West failed to cite any law spelling out the
       legality of following someone by car or on foot. Evidence at
       Zimmerman's trial has shown it was his pursuit of Martin, with a
       concealed semiautomatic handgun, that set in motion the event that
       led to Martin's death.

       understand what the charge conference was.

     The article places the judges instructions (0+ / 0-)
     into context
       This statement makes no sense. The judge didn't give any
       instructions today, and there were no "judge's instructions" to
       "place into context."  The judge had what is known as a "charge
       conference," which is legal argument on which instructions should,
       and should not, be given to the jury by the judge AFTER all closing
       arguments are done.  So even saying "the article put the judge's
       instructions in context" is wrong, as they judge didn't have any
       instructions today in any context.  Today was argument and rules
       about what those instructions WILL BE on tomorrow afternoon or
       Friday.
       You should at least develop an understanding of what happened in
       Court today before you criticize me and claim that a short Yahoo
       news story is preferable for determining what went on in Court
       today over actual videos of what went on in Court today.
       No wonder you misstate what's going on - you rely on Yahoo instead
       of video of what happened in court. I've tried cases that have been
       covered in the press (not with this level of national coverage, of
       course).  The news does not always get things right.

       You will see that I have many times implored my Kossian friends to
       engage and discuss with people on the right.  I have long
       maintained that the divide of the people has been deliberately
       engineered and that the financial debacle of 2008 would never have
       gone unpunished had that divide not been manufactured.
       But there is a difference between engaging with people who listen
       to what you have to say and respond accordingly and vice versa as
       you yourself live up to the responsibility of mutual exchange.
       Coffeetalk is so rigidly engaged with her own view that there is no
       listening.  Bring up one point and she glides into another without
       acknowledging even a single ounce of truth might possibly, in some
       alternate universe exist, in what you offered of your thoughts.
       I received a warning for my above comment, which merely expressed
       my perplexity as to why she might be continuing to engage here,
       since she is obviously not growing in her perception because she is
       so focused on deflection in order to reiterate her view.
       The numbers of people who explain to her how and why she is wrong
       is diminishing because it is exhausting to talk to a brick wall.
       What, is that not a definition of a troll?
       Ban me if you want.  I notice the diminishing numbers here. Perhaps
       others were a bit astonished to get a warning after such a long
       residence here, as I was. DailyKos has long been my go-to place -
       so much so that I haven't really explored a lot of other sites that
       I know are out there.  If it came down to a choice between me and
       coffeetalk, I'm sure I wouldn't want to be here if I were
       considered more offensive than she.
       Just as a final bit, I've always admired your posts, BoiseBlue.  It
       really surprised me that you don't see through this person too.

       word "provoked" as in "Zimmerman provoked Martin into hitting him,"
       there would be an objection and a request to instruct the jury on
       that.  There was no mention today of Zimmerman "provoking" Martin,
       or of Martin hitting Zimmerman in self-defense.  That's not an
       accident.
       Of course the judge doesn't say, in advance of a closing, what a
       lawyer can say.  But that was a ruling that there was not evidence
       that Zimmerman "provoked the use of force against himself" so as to
       be the aggressor under 776.041.  The prosecution now knows full
       well that an argument to the jury that Zimmerman provoked the use
       of force against himself by following Martin is improper.
       Even more directly, if that instruction HAD been included, then the
       prosecution would have used it in their closing -- they would have
       argued, using those instances of "following" and "confronting,"
       that Zimmerman "provoked" Martin.
       What do YOU think would happen if the prosecution said to the jury
       something like this:  "If Martin did hit Zimmerman in the nose, it
       was Zimmerman's own fault, because by following Martin, Zimmerman
       provoked Martin into hitting him"? I can tell you -- objection,
       motion for a mistrial.
       The prosecution knows full well that they can't say that now.
       That's why they softened it in closing -- BDLR only said that
       Zimmerman "started it" or "started this whole thing."  He's staying
       away from saying that Zimmerman provoked Martin into hitting him --
       and that's something he COULD have said if the Court had given the
       instruction.
       Take a look at the Gibbs case.  The law is as clear as West said,
       and the prosecution KNOWS the law is that clear, as West also said.
        You can't provoke force on yourself unless you use or threaten
       force.  And the judge rejected the prosecution's argument today
       that following is "provoking force against yourself" under the law.

       It's the same principle as the rejection of the prosecution's
       request for an instruction on Murder 3 based on child abuse.  That
       was rejected.  Don't you think that now means that it would be
       improper for the prosecution to argue, in closing, "Zimmerman's a
       child abuser"?  The judge didn't rule that the prosecution can't
       say that in closing.  But if they do, it clearly will be improper.

       You wrote:

     That's a ruling that there's no evidence that Zimmerman "provoked"
     Martin into using force against Zimmerman.

     You will notice that the only thing BDLR said today is that
     Zimmerman "started it" by following Martin.  But he cannot say that
     Martin was "defending himself" or was "justified" in hitting
     Zimmerman, because the judge has already ruled that there is no
     evidence sufficient to make that argument.
       The judge made no such ruling. The judge ruled what she would or
       would not put in a jury instruction.

       what was in evidence, as argued by counsel (you can see that in the
       videos I linked).
       The lawyers argued whether the instruction should be given based on
       the evidence.
       The judge's ruling not to give the instruction was an acceptance of
       the defense's argument that there was no evidence in the record
       that Zimmerman provoked the use of force against himself under
       Gibbs.
       She didn't flip a coin to decide whether to put it into the jury

       This reminded me of something I read from one of the
       provocation/stalking experts on here, who gave us [837]this bit of
       legal clairvoyance:

     I am not an expert (2+ / 0-)
     I would assume that the prosecution w ould put on a case of
     provocation and the defene will try to put on a case showing that
     even if it was provocation that it escalated so the defendant was
     still justified

     This would be a guess
     Each party would then seek the jury instructions depending on FL law
     that will help them based on the case they tried to present to the
     jury
     I dont see anything here that would put block the provation
     instruction because I think that can be shown since the standard,
     unlike what people sem to be believe, in FL for provocation isn't
     tha tone has violated the law
     The stalking standard really is just gravy and makes provocation
     easier to prove rather than eing necessary to argue provocation

       I know that Coffee Talk has persistently argued there is no legal
       basis for provocation but then if that were the case from a logical
       stand point I can't imagine a Florida prosecutor and judge inviting
       an obvious appeal and reversal of the case since provocation is
       exactly what the prosecution is arguing as part of their case.
       Also when I have looked up provocation, it seems like a vague term
       , which seems to mostly center around reasonable belief about
       imminent threats of illegal acts or actual illegal acts, but the
       key word seems to be "imminent"
       There's some case law, but its not very helpful, and other case law
       indicates pursuit can be evidence of provocation.
       Someone else has told me they just really like arguing. I am over
       doing that so much. It goes no where. So, I am going to
       unilaterally back away.

       Of course there was no ruling on what people can say in closing.
       But an argument now by the prosecution that, by following Martin,
       Zimmerman provoked Martin into hitting him would clearly draw an
       objection and maybe more.
       The judge also rejected an instruction on Murder 3 based on child
       abuse.  No, she did not rule that the prosecution can't say, "And
       Zimmerman is a child abuser."  But anything like that would draw an

       The judge's ruling on the jury instruction does not speak to what
       the prosecution or defense can say in closing. The prosecution's
       argument in fact is that Zimmerman provoked the confrontation. But
       that is their argument. The judge was not going to put the
       prosecution's theory of the case in jury instruction. She made the
       right call on this and on a number of other items concerning what
       the prosecution and defense wanted in the jury instruction. For
       example, the defense wanted the judge to include in the instruction
       that following a person was not a crime. The judge declined to
       include that as well, and rightly so.

   out.
   Under the circumstances he probably did at least at the point he began
   looking for Trayvon in that dark walk way.

   There is nothing that Zimmerman has claimed that does not give Trayvon
   the right to try to make him stop stalking him.

   Stalking is a criminal assault in Tort law.

   And if Zimmerman already had his gun out when they finally came face to
   face, Treyvon still was the one with the primary right to defend
   himself.

   Of the two the stalker was acting more like a criminal than the person

   I've posted it before: Frank Taffta, GZ's friend, stated in March on
   MSNBC that all Trayvon had to do was to "answer the question". Now how
   does Taffta know this? Obviously, GZ told him that he asked Trayvon
   "What are you doing here?". This jives with what Rachel said that she
   heard someone say what are you doing here?

   There are so many lies that GZ has told that the prosecutor can't name
   them all.

   Still say they should call GZ out on those stupid bandages. But if
   there is a nurse on the jury, she will know.

 A lot of misstatements ([1063]0+ / 0-)

   1. Rachel and GZ's statements match fairly well. Both state the
   following: TM asked why GZ followed him. GZ asks TM what was he doing
   here. Both RJ & GZ agree a tussle soon ensues.

   2. yes, the last call begins when TM loses GZ. The call wraps up when
   GZ & TM reconnect, a verbal exchange occurs, followed by the beginning
   of the brawl.

   3. GZ never claimed being ambushed. See item #1. Witnesses, RJ & GZ are
   reasonably consistent.

   4. and so how does that equal murder? Quite a stretch. Besides GZ
   called SPD.

   5. standard protocol.

   6. stopped tailing within 6 seconds of SPD request. Listen to
   audiotape, please. (GZ tailed TM not "chased" him as GZ was too slow
   and far away), TM disappeared for over 3 minutes. Both GZ and RJ's
   statements are in agreement on TM losing GZ.

   7. What advice? item #6 above?

   8. You seem to conveniently omit the photos and autopsy report
   indicating injuries of GZ & TM.

 Yes you can. ([1150]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   Under the theory that you are espousing, if I were to meet with someone
   to try and defuse bad blood between the two of us in a private location
   against the advice of authorities and that person were to attempt to
   kill me, I would have no ability to defend myself.

   First of all, the authorities would advise against it as a matter of
   their own defense of liability.  If they hadn't it could be easily
   argued that they should have after the fact and were therefore
   negligent in their duty to protect me.

   Second, just because I knowingly entered a situation that may be
   dangerous to myself does not negate my right to defend myself equal to
   the level of danger that presents itself.  i.e. If I enter a
   neighborhood wearing the colors of a rival neighborhood's gang and
   flashing signs, I still have the right to defend myself from anyone
   that might be offended by my obviously insulting behavior.  I might be
   arrested for various incitement charges, based upon local laws, but as
   long as I only used the same level of force/violence that was used
   towards myself, I wouldn't be guilty of murder in defending myself.

   All that aside, people have been approaching this entire trial
   incorrectly.  From the beginning, Zimmerman has made it a trial as to
   the threat level that Martin used upon Zimmerman.  In effect, Zimmerman
   has already admitted to the crime but is claiming that it was
   justifiable because Martin was attempting to kill him first.  The trial
   is about whether Martin was attempting Zimmerman.  If he was, then
   Zimmerman's actions were justified.  If he wasn't then they weren't.

   It is why the Prosecution's close confused so many.  They were trying
   to get the jury to ask itself if Martin was a threat to Zimmerman.

   A person's character is measured by how they treat everyone. Not just
   your pet group.

       1. Dispatchers in many jurisdictions are police. Whether sworn
       officers or civil servants, they represent the policy of the
       department when advising callers of what actions to take and not
       take.  I've had that happen myself:  "Hey, there's a really really
       drunk driver on Main St right now." "Are you following them?" "No,
       I'm just watching from the corner."  "OK, we don't want you to
       follow them."  It is very standard:  Don't follow them.
       2.  "Are you following him."  "Yeah."  "OK, we don't need you to do
       that."  Clear enough to me.  What's so hard to figure out about
       that?
       3.  If GZ did not follow TM after that conversation with
       dispatch/police, how did they come together in the same spot?  GZ
       was in his vehicle during the call.  There was no way for a vehicle
       to follow up off the road, back behind the buildings.
       Result:  Sorry, your points are simply incorrect across the board.

   contempt charges this morning, he was sarcastic, questioning the
   judge's decisions, horrible - turns out judge already gave him a
   pamphlet about how to behave in the courtroom!  She shut him up a
   couple times.  West totally changed his tone, he knew he was over the
   line.

   Anyway - the prosecution may not be fancy, but today he finally covered
   all the lies in detail.  He was impassioned and you could tell he was
   getting angry Travon was dead, and his anger was coming from his heart.

   Don West is not likeable.  He'll go full sarcastic bitch mode tomorrow,
   with his guess cartoon of what happened, and I can't imagine the Jury
   will care for him in the least.  And that, subconciously, matters, I'd
   think.

       That's what I felt like I was watching, a defence attorney at
       work...point by point, using emotions and theatrics attempting to
       poke holes in the state's case. So it was a bit surreal watching de
       la Rionda do this in attacking the defence's "case".
       Typically, a prosecutor spends her closing argument point by point
       arguing their theory of the case, what happened, and how the facts
       support a conviction under the law. And how they have proved each
       element of their case beyond a reasonable doubt.  That's not what
       the state did here today. de la Rionda spent his entire time
       punching holes in the defences "case", and talking very little
       about theirs. Their only theme seems to be, "Zimmerman profiled and
       followed Martin, and therefore he's defacto responsible for
       everything that happened after". That's their case. To anyone who
       tries criminal cases, surreal nature of this close was readily
       apparent. But it's reflective of the state's entire approach to the
       case.

 Well Logically Speaking ([1781]0+ / 0-)

   ...trying to prove a specific scenario happened (it wasn't self defense
   AND it happened exactly THIS way) is a harder task than trying to prove
   one of a larger set of scenarios happened (it wasn't self-defense), so
   the prosecution would need a very good reason (see below*) to set their
   own bar higher than it needs toi be, right?

   And logically speaking often the best way TO prove a negative (it
   wasn't self-defense)  is to assume the positive (in this case, the
   defense's "theory of the case" ) and show how that assumption leads to
   logical inconsistencies. Which to me seemed to be what the prosecution
   was (very effectively) doing yesterday.

   I, for one, think the totalilty of the evidence argues - beyiond a
   reasonable doubt - against self-defense. And I don't have - or need - a
   very specific scenario of how the fight (assuming there was one)
   occurred to get to that belief.

   * = potential very good reason - advancing a specific theory of what
   happened may reassure the jury.   In other word's thinking the
   "prosecution knows what happened" may well make the jury more
   comfortable in agreeing with the prosecution.  And that may well be a
   reason to give one in practice.  But it comes at a cost because it DOES
   open up the possibility of more logical holes in the prosecutions's
   case....the defense no longer has to convince the jury that it was
   self-defense, it may be enough to show that the one specific
   prosecution scenario didn't occur and  thus kill the credibility of the
   prosecution.

       the best way to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the self-defense
       claim is not applicable, is to discredit the testimony of the
       person providing it.
       Had GZ taken the stand, I think we can all agree that the
       prosecution would have destroyed his argument of self-defense.
       Well, a similar thing happened. The prosecution placed reasonable
       doubt onto the testimony of the defendant. Whether its orthodox or
       normal or not, the fact remains that the Prosecution basically
       said, "Those are balls" are discredited the witness, and thereby
       discredited the entire "believe every word I say" defense.

   And he spent a lot of time pointing out the profiling and malice,

   I defer to your lawyerly experience, I guess I speak as if I were a

   The judge allowing in alternate charges (lesser charges) made Zimmerman

 Agree. Poor, poor closing for the prosecution. ([1870]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1871]Catesby, [1872]Pi Li

   The content of this closing was all wrong for the prosecution.  Yes, he
   raised a LOT of questions about Zimmerman's veracity in his various
   statements.  But questions about Zimmerman's veracity is not enough for
   a conviction, because the prosecution bears the burden of proving,
   beyond a reasonable doubt, that Zimmerman did not act in self-defense.
    That means that they have to tell the jury that, based on the
   evidence, here's what happened, and there's no reasonable doubt that
   the scenario I just outlined to you is true.

   I don't think I've ever seen a closing argument by a prosecutor that
   focused almost entirely on raising questions rather than providing
   answers.  Questions benefit the defense.  Period.  The jury will be
   instructed that if they have doubts about whether Zimmerman acted in
   self-defense, they must find him not guilty.  To get a conviction, the
   prosecution needs to say to the jury, this is what happened, this is
   the evidence to support that, there's no reasonable doubt that this is
   what happened, and this scenario means guilt of this crime.

   Really, all BDLR presented to the jury as fact beyond a reasonable
   doubt was (1) Zimmerman admitted to following Martin at some point; (2)
   "there was some fighting"; and (3) Zimmerman shot Martin. The
   prosecutor raised questions about everything else:  a question about
   who confronted who;   a question about where that initial confrontation
   took place; a question about when and how they got to the "T"; a
   question about who threw the first punch; a question about whether
   Martin punched Zimmerman in the nose; a question about whether Martin
   beat Zimmerman's head against the sidewalk; a question about how bad
   the beating was (if it happened -- he wasn't clear about that); a
   question about where the gun was on Zimmerman; a question about exactly
   what the situation was when Zimmerman fired the gun; a question about
   the positions of the two when the gun was fired . . . I could go on and
   on.  He just raised questions; he did not give the jury a series of
   facts that they should accept beyond a reasonable doubt.

   It's almost as if he had the burden of proof wrong -- as if he thought
   that if he could poke holes in, or raise doubts about, Zimmerman's
   story, he gets a conviction.  In fact, the judge will instruct the jury
   that it's the other way around -- HE'S supposed to prove what happened
   beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction, and if the defense can poke
   enough holes in HIS story, they might get an acquittal.  He got so
   carried away in his reverse burden of proof that he even said, at one
   point, something like "the defense has to prove to you" -- that drew
   the objection from MOM, which was effectively by the judge who turned
   to instruct the jury that she would tell them the law (i.e., who has to
   prove what) in jury instructions.

   As I was listening to this, it was almost like being in an alternative
   universe, with the burden of proof reversed.  Maybe he's counting on
   the jury to be angry enough about Zimmerman's language, and
   inconsistencies in his statements, and on the jury wanting to hold
   someone responsible for Martin's death, that they will ignore the
   judge's instructions on who has the burden of proof.

       I'm sorry to say, I think this is exactly what they're hoping for.
       Especially since, you know, they couldn't get that whole child
       abuse thing in there. (I've had some issues with Don West's style,
       but I definitely shared his anger this morning...and this is
       speaking as someone who has slipped in her share of lesser
       included's...but never like that)
       Having said that, cynically speaking, I can't find much fault with
       this "hope the jury wants to punish Zimmerman for something"
       defence, as it's all he has. What else is he going to argue? I
       guess he scored some points regarding Zimmerman's inconsistencies,
       but they were really minor and I don't think it was nearly enough.
       Stylistically, I found his presentation a bit disjointed, but
       perhaps this was intentional because a linear approach to the facts
       might not have helped him. I will say that I don't care for all the
       shouting, sarcasm, waving, theatrics and faux outrage and emotion.
       Again, he's basing his case on emotions, not facts, so perhaps
       that's all he has, but I've always preferred a more reasoned and
       logical approach to the evidence
       Yeah, de la Rionda did an excellent job of proving that Zimmerman
       profiled and followed Martin. And if profiling and following
       someone were a crime, there's no doubt Zimmerman would be found
       guilty. Somewhere in there, however, there's a murder two and self
       defence trial, and maybe we'll hear about those crimes in the
       rebuttal.

   they lawyers that lose cases even though they brought a binder full of
   case law to closing.

   The prosecution's closing will probably get Zimmerman convicted of
   manslaughter and if the jury is sufficiently pissed that Zimmerman
   ended the life of a child because it was "God's plan", a murder 2
   conviction.

 That's what has been bugging me about this trial ([1908]2+ / 0-)

   It seems like, for some reason, putting reasonable doubt in the juror's
   minds rests with the prosecution. It's quite baffling and the reason
   why I've been following this case so closely.

   A) Okay, we all know GZ shot TM. The question is whether it was
   self-defense.

   B) It seems as though the defense is building a "beyond a reasonable
   doubt" case while the prosecution is building a "reasonable doubt"
   case.

   And to state the obvious, it should be the other way around.

   My history will clearly show that I am biased in this case and, as many
   others have stated, I don't like to predict what juries will do.

   It could be that they decide that Zimmerman couldn't have shot Martin
   in self-defense (which is what I believe). The prosecution has put
   plenty of doubt on that, IMO.

   But the state is supposed to prove it BEYOND a reasonable doubt.

   Anyhow, I'm glad I'm not a juror in this case, and you are right. The
   prosecution has put forward an awesome defense.

   I'm not that confident that they've proved murder, or even
   manslaughter, beyond a reasonable doubt.

   They've just put forth a lot of doubt. That's not what prosecutors are
   supposed to do.

   P.S. I am not a crackpot.

   Zimmerman can't claim self defense if he started the confrontation with
   someone minding his own business.

   The defense's strategy seems to be that Trayvon ended up being a better
   fighter than George was, so Zimmerman had to use a gun after he
   realized he was losing the fight

       The judge will instruct the jury that they can use their common
       sense in evaluating the evidence, and the credibility of the
       witnesses.
       But they absolutely cannot substitute their "common sense" for the
       law, and the judge will instruct them on the law they must follow
       in coming to a verdict.
       The reason for this is, we all have experience in judging the
       credibility of people we're listening to...and evaluating factual
       situations. So it's OK to use our common sense when evaluating
       those things. But when it comes to the law, where most of us don't
       have experience, and might not agree with it, we can't substitute
       our "common" sense, which actually isn't so "common" at all,
       because we all most be operating under the same set of rules.
       I've been saying here throughout the course of this trial that the
       state is going to rely on a "but for"/"common sense" argument..i.e.
       this never would have happened if Zimmerman had just stayed in his
       car. And today I lost count of how many times de la Rionda used the
       term "common sense" He used it more than "law", or "reasonable
       doubt" or "proof".  And by doing this, de la Rionda was, very
       subtly, invited the jury to convict Zimmerman on something other
       than the law. And they're not supposed to do that.
       What juries actually end up doing, on the other hand, is sometimes
       different, and it's this "common sense" reasoning the state is
       probably counting on for at least a compromise verdict.

     And if it can't our law demands that no one be found guilty.
       But that's the tricky part of this case, isn't it. I think one of
       the things working against Zimmerman is that, well, he actually did
       kill Martin.
       Criminal trials are all about assigning blame. The state has given
       the jury George Zimmerman, no one else. He admits to killing
       Martin, but is claiming self defence, fair enough. But in a case
       like this with no real witnesses to the actual event, when a
       defendant says "I didn't do it, I wasn't there", at least then when
       the jury finds reasonable doubt, they can assuage any remorse that
       they might feel for not holding anyone responsible for the victim's
       death by telling themselves that the police will eventually find
       the real culprit. But in this case, if they let Zimmerman walk,
       that's it...no one will ever be held responsible for the death of
       this kid.
       And juries don't like that...which is why the manslaughter
       instruction is so dangerous for this defendant. It gives the jury
       an "out" to hold Zimmerman responsible without convicting him of
       murder.

       how many potential jurors during voir dire express the thought that
       you will automatically have to be punished if you killed someone.
       Even though they accept the defense of self-defense in theory, they
       can't get around the feeling that you should still be held
       responsible if you kill someone.  The most extreme version of that
       is in a capital case when the potential juror says that he would
       not impose the death penalty in all cases, for instance, he
       wouldn't impose the death penalty if it was self-defense.

       holder at which time he can shoot them.

       If I am walking down a deserted street at night, and some "creepy"
       man looks like he is following me, and he catches up to me and
       says, "what are you doing here?" I cannot legally hit him.  If I
       do, I have committed battery.  I can run away, I can scream, etc.,
       but I cannot use force against him if he has not used, or
       threatened, force against me.
       Now, if he is following me, and he catches up to me and points a
       gun at me, or holds up a baseball bat and tries to swing it at me,

 I would not characterize 'fight back' as reacting ([2139]0+ / 0-)

       me that could get pretty out of control.
       Basically what you are saying is that you have to wait for a
       stalker to actually get a hand on you in which case for many it is
       too late. Especially if that person is armed.
       As far as swinging a bat or an arm... the creep kills you and can
       go on to kill again since you can not testify what he was doing.
       How can one stand their ground if they are pursuing another and
       then use the others resistance to their assumed authority as an
       excuse to kill them. So pursuit is just fine and dandy if no one is
       left alive to counter  their stories.

   If, in evaluating all the evidence, the jury concludes that it was not
   reasonable for Zimmerman to fear for his life, they would certainly be
   justified in returning a conviction.

   On the other hand, if they believe Zimmerman reasonably feared for his
   life in shooting Martin, and acquit him of murder two, but return a
   compromise verdict of manslaughter just to "split the baby" and hold
   someone responsible, that would NOT be following the law, because if
   they believe the shooting was justified via self-defence, it covers
   both self-defence and manslaughter. (Without getting into the weeds too
   much on this, there is a concept of "imperfect" self defence that for a
   variety of reasons I don't think is applicable here).

   Again, juries do sometimes return these compromise verdict, which is
   exactly why prosecutor's overcharge and why manslaughter is included in
   the instructions.

       Let's say someone actually does walk up to me, and intentionally
       provoke me into a fight, perhaps by actually hitting me first. And
       we have all this on video, and audio, so it is perfectly recorded.
       That's assault (and battery).
       But if I then hit him hard enough that he fears for his life, then
       can he really claim self-defense if he pulls out a gun and shoots

   when he got out of the SUV and started following Trayvon, rather it's
   what happened in the actual confrontation that eventually occurred. If
   GZ threw the first punch or if he made an aggressive attempt to
   restrain Trayvon and Trayvon reacted by punching back then GZ would no
   longer be able to claim self defense. IANAL of course.

       If by "attack," all they did is punch you once and run away, then
       you can't run after them to "defend" yourself.  Self defense is
       actions taken to prevent future injury to yoursel.  If they hit you
       once and run away, you call the police and file a complaint.
       Self-defense is not the same as retribution.
       If what they do in response to your name-calling is physical force
       but not sufficient to put you in reasonable fear of death or great
       bodily harm (say, just pushing and shoving, maybe pushing you down)

   The judge and officers if the court are absolutely required to follow

   I think nearly every judge issues strict instructions about what the
   jury "must" do. Except there isn't an absolute "must".

   There are consequences for failing to follow the law, of course. Not so
   much for the jury, though. No judge would be kind about this. But few
   judges have the guts to throw out a bogus verdict or declare a
   mistrial.

   Fortunately, those chosen to serve on a jury generally take their
   responsibility seriously and understand the instructions and the
   importance of following the law.

   I think you're right about the state depending on common sense and
   emotional appeals. And I think it's not a bad strategy for a jury
   trial. It would certainly not fly in a non-jury trial.

   Yet we still can't predict a verdict.

       We have several eye witnesses, all who only saw a little of what
       happened. Many admitted that it was too dark to be sure what they
       saw. And nobody claims to have seen the shooting. So all the State
       could do was create a timeline based on when phone calls began and

       But with regards to the law that the judge instructs them on, they
       must apply the facts to that law...and follow the law, in reaching
       a verdict.
       The good news is, the vast majority of jurors do this, and take

 They've convicted people on far less than that ([2376]0+ / 0-)
       They convicted an obviously creepy guy in California on killing his
       wife and unborn fetus on entirely circumstantial evidence. The jury
       even gave him the death penalty.
       I wasn't real comfortable with that verdict. Ya, he probably did it
       but didn't pass the beyond a reasonable doubt threshold for me.
       As for Zimmerman, there is far more evidence of his crime here than
       in the circumstances in the California case.

     And today I lost count of how many times de la Rionda used the term
     "common sense" He used it more than "law", or "reasonable doubt" or
     "proof".  And by doing this, de la Rionda was, very subtly, invited
     the jury to convict Zimmerman on something other than the law. And
     they're not supposed to do that.

   The prosecutor was just asking jurors to use their common sense to
   evaluate Zimmerman's credibility, and it did so by pointing to the many
   holes in his story.  There's absolutely nothing improper about that, at
   least not in an American courtroom.  I can't speak for how you do

       The jury doesn't have to believe Zimmerman's story, a story that
       frankly strikes me as pretty incredible.  If they don't buy it,
       then his whole self-defense rationalization collapses.
       What a lot of people are losing sight of here is that there's no
       dispute that Zimmerman shot Martin to death.  There's also no
       dispute that Zimmerman had a gun and that Martin was unarmed.
       There are recordings proving that Zimmerman chose to follow Martin
       around the neighborhood and that he thought the kid was an
       "asshole" and somehow up to no good.  Zimmerman refused to take the
       dispatcher's advice and continued to follow Martin and then got out
       of his car to confront him.
       It's really hard for me to see how you claim self-defense on those
       facts (and the others), but then, some people will believe
       anything.

       The reason why the defense doesn't quite work for you once is
       because you realized the defendant's claims are incredible, at
       best, and out and out lies in many cases.
       Once you decide that, the rest should be easy.
       Except for America's race problem.
       Part of that is that blacks have super human powers to survive high
       levels of pain (Rodney King) and engage in things that requires
       both great strength, multiple limbs (or at least telekinetic
       powers, etc.
       That's what clouds the judgment, even amongst the liberals.. Race
       is a part of their calculus, but they will deny it to their denying
       breath.
       If this were a white teen, and a black male of the same age, there
       wouldn't have been a dispute. Everyone knows that, and yet, when I
       said it, some folks, chimed in a diary I wrote swearing "we can't
       be sure of that" Of course the stats says I am right, but "we can't
       be sure."
       I could see if the defendant's claims were credible, but when you
       got people claming his story is consistent because "at the end
       after all the  other lies he told" i may be that it was in fear for
       his life, you just got to realize how powerful race is because no
       blood evidence, No DNA, no wounds, but its credible because some
       experts say its possible that magically blood remained on Zimmerman
       in the rain without remaining on the victim. Yeah, and if the
       defendant wasn't a liar, that may be a benefit I am willing to
       consider. But under the circumstances, with all the other evidence,
       its unreasonable.

 That's not a fair comparison ([2446]0+ / 0-)
       Zimmerman is as white as Obama.  He is half native American and
       half white.  He doesn't even remotely look white.  And that goes
       beyond his color.  Look at his features.
       But many people here, like yourself, label him as white because you
       can't accept that "brown" people can be racist.  That "brown"
       people can hold the same knee-jerk views towards young black males
       as whites do.
       Here's a shocker - a lot of Haitians in Florida have similar
       attitudes towards AAs.
       This has everything to do with Trayvon being black, but it has
       nothing to do with Zimmerman being white - because he's not.
       If Trayvon were white, this incident probably would never have
       happened.
       But it didn't happen because Zimmerman was white.  Because he
       isn't.

       The same dynamic is playing as far as guns. It has little if

   I went to law school in America. I practiced law in America. In
   American courtrooms. As a prosecutor.

   And when de la Rionda implies that Zimmerman is legally responsible for
   the death of Martin because he "profiled" and "followed" him, and
   invites them to use their "common sense" to reach that conclusion, he's
   inviting them to reach a verdict on something other than the law.

   On the other hand, it's perfectly proper, and I said multiple times in
   this thread, for jurors to use their common sense to evaluate the
   evidence and testimony.

       proof beyond a reasonable doubt is in FL but in NC it includes the

       common sense".  So if FL is similar he could be repeating that
       phrase for simply that reason instead of promoting some sort of
       jury nullification.  But you are probably most likely correct
       because they don't really have a theory of the case that they are
       claiming they have proved BRD.  Instead they are claiming the
       defense hasn't proven self-defense BRD.  Which isn't of course, the

       ...here's the instruction.  I've highlighted the sections that seem
       to be confusing some people. :)

     3.7 PLEA OF NOT GUILTY; REASONABLE DOUBT;
     AND BURDEN OF PROOF

         The defendant has entered a plea of not guilty. This means you
     must presume or believe the defendant is innocent. The presumption
     stays with the defendant as to each material allegation in the
     [information] [indictment] through each stage of the trial unless it
     has been overcome by the evidence to the exclusion of and beyond a
     reasonable doubt.
         To overcome the defendant's presumption of innocence, the State
     has the burden of proving the crime with which the defendant is
     charged was committed and the defendant is the person who committed
     the crime.
         The defendant is not required to present evidence or prove
     anything.
         Whenever the words "reasonable doubt" are used you must consider
     the following:
     A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt, a speculative,
     imaginary or forced doubt. Such a doubt must not influence you to
     return a verdict of not guilty if you have an abiding conviction of
     guilt. On the other hand, if, after carefully considering, comparing
     and weighing all the evidence, there is not an abiding conviction of
     guilt, or, if, having a conviction, it is one which is not stable
     but one which wavers and vacillates, then the charge is not proved
     beyond every reasonable doubt and you must find the defendant not
     guilty because the doubt is reasonable.
     It is to the evidence introduced in this trial, and to it alone,
     that you are to look for that proof.
     A reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant may arise from
     the evidence, conflict in the evidence, or the lack of evidence.
     If you have a reasonable doubt, you should find the defendant not
     guilty. If you have no reasonable doubt, you should find the
     defendant guilty.

       I think this instruction is hard to follow.  In NC our instruction
       is much better for the defense.  The jury is told that a reasonable
       doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense.  That it isn't a
       "vain or fanciful" doubt and that to find someone guilty BRD you
       must be "fully satisfied" and "entirely convinced" of their guilt.
        "Fully satisfied and entirely convinced" is good language for the
       defense in my opinion.

   Most of the "facts" that are in evidence about the time of the shooting
   (which is the most critical time here) is from Zimmerman's testimony
   from interviews, the walk-through and his conversations with friends.

   The prosecutor is pointing out all of the inconsistencies Zimmerman's
   statements and how unbelievable some of his statements are.   He's
   asking for the jurors to use their common sense in evaluating
   Zimmerman's statements and if they don't believe him then they probably
   won't believe he was justified in shooting Martin.

   I believe the "profiled" and "following" comments along with the
   "a**hole" and "f'ing punks" comments are to show Zimmerman's state of
   mind towards Martin.   Even though they didn't know each other which
   would normally be required for him to have ill will towards Martin,
   they are showing that he had profiled Martin as one of the "f'ing
   punks" who burglarize our community and always get away.

   I also liked that he mentioned how Zimmerman after shooting Martin and
   fatally injuring him he holstered his weapon and made no effort to get
   him help.   If he had no ill will towards Martin why didn't he yell for
   help for him after he shot him?

   The defense is getting a lot of credit they don't deserve.   I think
   the Hannity interview was some of the most damaging testimony and
   cannot fathom why the attorneys let him do it.

 Um ([2533]0+ / 0-)

   There's no question that Zimmerman is responsible for Martin's death.
   He shot and killed the kid.  That's not in dispute.  The only issue
   here is Zimmerman's claim of self-defense.

   The jury is entitled to draw inferences from Zimmerman's behavior and
   his words.  I don't see how the prosecution is inviting the jury to
   reach a verdict on anything other than the law.

   In any event, I'm not going to belabor this point.  We're not going to
   convince each other, so I think this is becoming a waste of pixels.

       A simple 'yes' or 'no' to the query about whether this lawyer's

       This has nothing to do with not liking the content of her

   Part of what's partially disturbed me during this ongoing conversation
   about this trial is the seeming willingness of people, who I presume to
   be liberal and most times pay at least lip service to things like due
   process, reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence, seem to be so
   willing to set it all aside for defendants they dislike. I have my own
   issues with how Zimmerman behaved that night and the choices he made,
   but that doesn't change how I analyse the legal aspects of this case.

   I guess we can all be grateful that the state didn't charge Zimmerman
   with first degree murder...imagine all the explaining people would have
   to do on why they've temporarily suspended their opposition to the
   death penalty.

       I'm not sure I agree that there's no way he gets convicted,
       especially when a compromise verdict is a very real possibility.
       But you highlight an important distinction between whether someone
       is truly innocent, or whether the state has just been unable to
       prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.

     I think there is a boy dead because of the foreseeable consquences

       Yeah. Whatever the verdict, whether the state has proven their case
       or not, George Zimmerman is not "innocent".  You can't escape the
       fact that had he just stayed in his car and waited for the police
       arrive, Martin would still be alive. He's going to have to live
       with that no matter what.

 Although... ([2722]0+ / 0-)
       ...if (with the focus on if) everything Zimmerman said is correct
       and complete, he didn't break any laws.
       Zimmerman obviously could have avoided the conflict, but so could
       have Martin by simply going "home" or by not hitting Zimmerman.
       In Zimmerman's version, I hold Martin much more culpable than
       Zimmerman. The first person to break a law was Martin when he hit
       Zimmerman without provocation and that is what turned the situation
       violent. Zimmerman is, at worst, guilty of having less than perfect
       judgement. But, I'm sure his judgement was no worse than most of us
       have exercised in various situations in our life. However, most of
       us, I'd wager, have never attacked an adult, and continued that
       attack with force that could clearly cause great bodily injury or
       death, without provocation. (I'm excluding stuff that we may have
       done in anger to a classmate or playmate in grade school that was
       actually dangerous but we didn't realize it yet)
       I am confident (or at least hopeful) that if a clear video w/good
       sound of the entire event was suddenly revealed and it
       substantially confirmed Zimmerman's account, folks here wouldn't be
       debating Zimmerman's guilt at all. Perhaps there would be a
       discussion, but it might be about Florida law (as it was, in part,
       in the early rush to uninformed judgement here that Zimmerman would
       take advantage of SYG because that was all he could claim), CCW,
       and/or Neighborhood Watch.

   You can toss out authoritative-sounding legal arguments whenever it
   suits you so that nobody will fail to realize that you're an attorney,
   and you can also sling fact-free retorts like a commoner. Such

       as an insult? Or do you want to leave that to the person who hurled
       it?
       I'm not involved in the rest of your multiweek pie fight. However,
       I have said elsewhere that these personality driven exchanges are
       not productive. In this particular sub sub thread, the demand for a
       commenter to prove her bona fides are obnoxious and contrary to the
       general site ethos. It's like we need our own jury charge -- if you
       don't find the commenter's comments persuasive, or you think she's
       lied elsewhere (a common allegation of yours), you are free to
       disregard the rest of her comments.
       As the tension ramps up in this case, this stuff has the potential
       to do far more harm than good to the community if some people don't
       knock it off. And I am not one of those who say there are no
       Zimmerman defenders, although I believe several people have been
       incorrectly put in that class. Given that they are more than
       capable of defending themselves, I've found no need to weigh in for
       the most part. It appears to be their ability to defend themselves
       that annoys those who are not similarly equipped. (I don't put you
       in that category either.)
       I have not engaged much substantively after the immediate calls for
       a prosecution, because I have not been able to follow closely
       either the pretrial development of evidence or the trial itself.
       Feel free to put me in whatever little camp you like.

       because you've invested a lot of time and thought in your
       contributions in the diaries on this case.
       Who said I wasn't interested? I said I wasn't involved. I've been
       interested enough to see you and coffeetalk, and later Pi Li, as
       well as others, having the same fight over and over and over again.
       I've been interested enough to see who takes delight in pointing
       out the weaknesses of the prosecution's case and who cringes in
       astonishment. I've seen who is unwilling to acknowledge that there
       are any weaknesses at all, so the prosecution must be deliberately
       throwing the case. I've seen "all we want is a prosecution and fair
       trial" morph into "convict him of murder or there's no justice."
       I've seen people whose natural inclination is to favor putting the
       state to its proof and providing an adequate defense completely
       change hats. It's nothing if not interesting around here.
       Trayvon Martin's death is real to me. The lesser value placed on
       black victims than white ones is real to me. The pain of the many
       mothers here who post in anguish because they see their sons in
       Trayvon Martin is real to me. Even the pain of the Zimmerman
       family, however much I despise him, is real to me. The
       overwhelmingly crappy job done by many police departments in many
       communities is real to me. The failings of our "better than the
       alternative, usually, maybe" justice system have been real to me
       since before I joined it.
       The fight you are having here with Pi Li? That is a piefight.

   Your spelling alone indicates you're not American.  If you want to

   surprised when people ask you to back up your claim by telling them
   exactly what your experience is.

   like whether or not you're a member of the Florida bar.  The state has
   thousands and thousands of lawyers.  It's not like your membership is a
   piece of personally identifiable information that will out you to the
   folks here.

   Watch:  I'm admitted to the bar in California and the District of

     If you want to claim you speak with some kind of authority, then you
     shouldn't be surprised when people ask you to back up your claim by
     telling them exactly what your experience is
       For one thing, the only "claims" about my professional
       qualifications have been what I've said here, and there's no way to
       "back up" those, or others, including saying whether I'm licensed
       in Florida or not. People can judge for themselves if they find my
       posts credible or not.
       I could be a Florida attorney who knows nothing about criminal law
       and procedure. Or a bad Florida lawyer. And everything I say here
       could be wrong.
       On the other hand, I could be a very good lawyer in another state
       and everything I say here could be right.

     Personally, I have no idea why you're so reticent to answer a
     question like whether or not you're a member of the Florida bar.
       So since it's the usual 2-3 haters asking me this question, I don't
       know, I'm just kinda assuming it's not in good faith. You see, if I
       say I'm not licensed in Florida, the answer will be "See, you're
       not licensed in Florida, you know nothing!" And if I say I am, the
       answer would be "Well, you're not a very good one".  And that will
       be the rejoinder from them with every post I make. In fact, that
       very thing has happened to another attorney on here opinion on this
       case.Perhaps if you had been called a "Zimmerman apologist" like
       several of us have here (including one of this site's front page
       lawyers) for discussing things like due process and burden of
       proof, you'd feel the same.
       So, not wanting to get sidetracked with all that, I think I'll keep
       my bar membership status to myself. You are free to publish the
       rest of your CV if you wish, however. :)

   She has written about Florida law as she sees it. Anyone can rebut it
   if they feel she is in error. I don't see where you find implied
   superiority. Trial lawyers make declarative statements, that's how they
   operate in an adversarial system. The sparring here at DKOS has given
   readers a much more comprehensive view of the Florida criminal law in
   this case than had it been all one-sided. Pi Li has helped correct a
   tremendous amount of misinformation has been echoing around the site,
   relative to this case.

   You're either admitted in Florida or you're not.  Frankly, I still
   don't understand why it's such a big deal for you to admit you're not a
   Florida lawyer.  I'm not a member of that state's bar, and I don't see
   any reason to be coy about that.

   From what I've read of your posts, it doesn't appear you're an American
   lawyer at all.  Which is obviously fine, but it does tend to affect the
   weight people will accord to what you post here.  When it comes to
   commentary about this case, I'd naturally be more interested in the
   views of someone who practiced criminal law in Florida than in the
   views of a corporate lawyer from New York.

   I don't really need to publish my CV.  There are plenty of people on
   this site who have actually met me in person.  l've disclosed things
   that are a hell of a lot more personal than my bar membership status.

   repeatedly dismissing the social justice implications of this tragic

       Over the past two weeks there has been an avalanche of
       misinformation, here at DKOS, regarding both the evidence presented
       and the applicable Florida criminal statutes. As a reality based
       site I think that those who know the facts have a duty to help the
       less informed understand what is really happening at this trial.
       While that is perceived by some, and maybe you, as not being
       sensitive to the tragic death of Trayvon Martin, is unfortunate.
       This was a heart breaking event for all the parties, but
       particularly the Martin family and their deceased son. However, we
       can't have diaries on this trial and just let completely false
       statements go unchallenged. I think nearly everyone who is making
       false statements is doing so because they lack knowledge of Florida
       criminal law and court policies and procedures, not out of an
       intent to misinform the readers. Nevertheless those misstatements
       must be challenged.
       There is a higher level debate among several lawyers on some
       technical aspects of a few very specific Florida laws. That's very
       different, and not what I am referring to at all.

   perfectly clear?

   blah, blah, blah

   They fought.

   There are witnesses who saw them fighting.

   Don't get caught up with who was winning.

   Zimmerman proves he is lying so badly about what happened, because
   there are just so many stupid lies, that whatever he claims about his
   fear doesn't even matter.

   What you need to remember is that AFTER shooting TM, Zimmerman lied
   some more in ways that reveal his state of mind; his indifference to
   just having killed a man. "Despite obvious facts in evidence - aka the
   dead body on the ground - Zimmerman lied to police and told them he
   spread out TM's arms to check for weapons."

   The theory of the case is that Zimm had so much ill will and prejudice
   toward this kid walking home, and wanted soooo very badly to use his
   gun, and so very badly to been seen by the cops as competent
   neighborhood watchman, that he just made shit up - right after he shot
   and killed the kid.

   From A to Z killing the kid wasn't a mistake, and there is no evidence
   that Zimm ever thought it was a mistake, BECAUSE Zimm pursued TM with
   his gun AND felt justified shooting him at point blank range in the
   chest. So much so that he made up some fantasy cop claims despite the
   dead body lying right there on the ground.

   Am I not understanding your point?

   Their theory is that he had ill will, acted on his ill will, and shot
   Trayvon, and then just re-holstered his gun, then made up stupid shit
   to try and impress the police.

   The problem with situations like this is that they escalate.  Each side
   feels more danger to itself than it thinks it is presenting to the
   other. Each side can respond with what it perceives as proportionate
   force, while actually ratcheting up the violence of the confrontation.
    If you ever seen a fist fight start, there's a 90% chance it started
   just that way.

   So somebody can well enter a situation with no intention of committing
   assault, then through no fault of the other guy end up killing that guy
   out of genuine fear for his own safety, which is why carrying a gun
   into an avoidable confrontation is just plain stupid.  This is the
   problem with the gun nut's paradise in which everyone is carrying
   concealed weapons and has the right to appoint himself deputy Angel of
   Justice.  Too many people have exactly the wrong reaction to being
   armed, because they mistakenly believe having a gun prepares them for a
   deadly confrontation. Trayvon Martin is the first fruits of many
   needless killings to come, in which stupid people ignorantly carry guns
   into situations that are way over their head.

   I know people here want Zimmerman convicted of second degree murder
   because he racially profiled Trayvon and therefore they think that
   Zimmerman must be some kind of uncommon racist monster. But that view
   of matters obscures the real problem.  Zimmerman profiled Trayvon not
   because Zimmerman was some kind of rare monster, but because he was a
   garden variety idiot -- an idiot typical of a whole bunch more idiots
   running around Florida with concealed handguns and delusions of
   grandeur.

 Just a little quibble but I think the Judge ruled ([3068]0+ / 0-)
       that the State has not shown sufficient evidence that Zimmerman
       provoked the use of force against himself.  The Judge's decision
       should be seen as a reflection of that rather than a declarative
       statement by the judge that it did not happen.  Aside from that, I
       appreciate your links and your arguments.  I personally would like
       for Zimmerman to be found guilty because he represents everything I
       find that is reprehensible about the gun/police worshipping culture
       and just pure racism.  As a lawyer though I accept that my wishes
       show less character that I ought to have when wanting the rule of
       law to be applied fairly and equally.  With that said, I don't
       think the State had a great case to start with but I think they
       have done a bad job with what they had.  I don't think their
       weaknesses mean Zimmerman is truly innocent but I expect he will be
       found to be so.

   you. Under Florida law the "confrontation" started when the first punch
   was thrown. Zimmerman questioning Martin isn't an illegal
   "confrontation" and in no way inhibits Zimmerman's self defense claim.

   an appeaser to those of us up in arms, understandably, that a kid was
   killed.

   I personally don't know that there is enough evidence to show malice
   required for Murder 2.

   I personally thought that at the very  least, not legally but morally,
   Zimmerman was responsible for the death of a minor because he made
   assumptions and judgements that were wrong. This would hold even if TM
   punched him first, which I don't think happened.How he could not say
   that he was neighborhood watch is mind blowing...he didn't even explain

   I think he really believes he couldn't have done things better. He
   thinks TM is a thug even though he turned out no to be thuggish at that
   particular time. He does not own that he made a gigantic error in
   thinking a stranger randomly walking by WAS a criminal suspect. He was
   SO SURE of this because of his previous experiences and prejudice. So
   very sure enough that it altered what he'd do. He ran after TM. NO one
   believes he was looking for the street sign in a neighborhood with
   three streets that he's lived in for four years and has been the
   Neighborhod Watch leader.

   simply charged by information?  States don't use grand juries all that
   much.

   So there's absolutely nothing unusual in the prosecutor simply charging
   the defendant in an information without taking the matter to a grand

   for killing an unarmed kid he wrongfully profiled is "political".

   This case is simple. Zimmerman cannot claim self-defense b/c he
   initiated the encounter with Martin. He was instructed by the 911
   dispatcher not to follow Martin. Not only does he continue to pursue
   Martin but he gets out of his car to follow the kid. I hope the jury

     introduced as evidence?
       Don't you find this brilliant at all?
       Aside from any forensics, the 911 & NEN recordings, the only eye
       witness account to what occurred-from beginning to end- is the
       shooter.  The only other eye witness is tragically quite dead.
       As a "not a lawyer", what I have been seeing is the state keeping
       it simple and sticking to what they can prove and by meticulously
       connecting the dots that establish that the shooter has little to
       no credibility via his own actions/mouth.
       The prosecution has  to prove that Trayvon Martin died, that GZ
       killed Trayvon Martin, that GZ did act in an imminently dangerous
       way towards another & demonstrated a depraved mind without regard
       to human life.
       And the prosecution has to disprove the self-defense claim of GZ.
       Right?
       Sure appears to me that they have done all of the above using GZ
       own statements-backing each & every point they are making with
       forensics/evidence.
       As I mention, IANAL.  Neither are the jurors.  IMHO, they will
       either see clearly what has been obvious from the beginning based
       on just the evidence & the shooters own statements or they won't.
       I believe that the state has provided them with clear & simple
       means to do so.

     Zimmerman cannot claim self-defense b/c he initiated the encounter
     with Martin

   First, even if someone provokes the use of force against himself, he
   CAN claim self-defense [3283]under some circumstances.

   However, in order to provoke the use of force against yourself, you
   need to [3284]use or threaten force.

   Today, in the charge conference, the State wanted the Court to give an
   instruction based on the statute in the link above, claiming that
   Zimmerman "provoked" the use of force against himself by following and
   "confronting" Martin.  The Defense argued that the Court could not give
   that instruction because there was no evidence Zimmerman was the first
   to use or threaten force, citing [3285]Gibbs.

   The Court agreed with the defense's position and ruled that it would
   NOT give the instruction.

   there may have been a gap and then shouting, on another tape (there
   were multiple 911 calls/tapes) that they are talking about. I'm just
   speculating. Perhaps GZ started to shout (not the scream of terror) for
   help after he pulled the trigger.

   But the one tape that we hear the shot...the screaming stops at the
   short abruptly as if the screamer is silenced.

   If Zimmerman was the screamer and didn't know he pulled the trigger as
   he said, he'd not have had a reason to stop screaming at that exact
   point.

   But when your lungs are instantaneously punctured by a bullet, you have
   no wind to scream like that suddenly.

       I said he said that. At one point he tells the police that he

       It is hard to imagine a scenario where someone is on the bottom,
       screaming steadily for the 40 sec that we hear on the tape, while
       being punched and bashed. The gun is behind your right hip (that is
       where on the police video we see Zimmerman show us where it
       is...not where the Defense council showed us this week...which was
       further to the front).. You are lying on your gun...it is in your
       waist band under your shirt and jacket.
       You scream for 40 sec yet somehow, also, TM is covering your mouth
       and nose with both of his hands (he did also say this). Yet somehow
       TM does not get your blood on his hands or sleeves. And somehow TM
       sees your gun in the rain in the dark behind you under your clothes

       he was on top of his gun as it was behind his hip. If he were on
       the bottom.
       If he were on the top pointing the gun at TM, it would more easily
       explain"
       --how someone could scream for 40 sec which we hear...as the
       screaming person was the one who never had his mouth and nose
       covered (TM) per GZ"s story.
       -why TM has no blood on his hands or sleeves despite GZ's nose
       bleeding from supposedly being punched when the fight started. TM
       didn't have his hands on GZ's mouth and nose after all.
       I can easily imagine TM shrieking when he saw that gun. It's
       possible TM was on top initially in the fight...they might have
       rolled around. GZ could have had his head on pavement once or twice
       (that's the maximum the medical examiner said).
       But it is also possible that GZ was on top later in the fight, and
       does not contradict the ear and eye witnesses and was pointing the
       gun at TM.

 Ok gotcha ([3400]0+ / 0-)
       I didnt know he said that he was not sure that he had pulled the
       trigger. IMHO, then if that is true, doesn't sound like someone who
       was so fearful for his life that is why he used deadly force as he
       claims SYG affords him.
       And I fully agree about the screaming,especially if he wasn't sure
       he'd pull the trigger. Sounds like he is trying too hard.
       I think there is reasonable credibility doubts and gaps Z 's SYG
       claim is not strong. So imho absent that, he is guilty.
       That said I definitely am not under any illusion that the outcome
       may not be what I believe, that Z is a liar about the circumstances
       and that he is guilty of as charged. Hope at least manslaughter.
       Fact remains his SYG defense has some reasonable doubts holes poked
       in it. Without that defense...he's has to be found guilty of
       something. But history tells me not to expect it. Justice often
       seems unfair...unfortunately.

       Zimmerman states he wasn't even sure he shot Martin.  Why would he
       stop yelling for help?  Especially if he was still so scared that
       he had to get on top of the fatally wounded Martin and spread out
       his arms.
       Of course, if it was Martin screaming for his life we all clearly
       understand why the screams for help stopped and probably why the
       screams were so frantic - he had a gun pointed at him.

 He would stop yelling because the blows stopped ([3413]0+ / 0-)
       He took an action that led to the blows stopping.  Whoever was
       yelling was not yelling literally non-stop.  It was a series of
       yells interspaced by moments without yells.  Whether or not he knew
       his gunshot hit and critically injured Trayvon, at that point the
       blows stopped, and so his yelling stopped in his version of events.
       It does seem bizarre for us to hear that he didn't know that he had
       hit Trayvon at that close range.  It's possible that he thought he
       may have missed and that Trayvon simply became docile out fear of
       the gun.  It does seem a little far-fetched except for the police
       testimony that Zimmerman seemed surprised to learn that Trayvon was
       dead.
       How could he think he had missed?  Well, he might not have aimed
       carefully if he was indeed being struck and trying to ward off the
       blows.  I think the instinctive thing to do would be to cover
       and/or turn your head to try to avoid direct blows to the face.  If
       he was doing that and drew and fired in one motion, then it's
       certainly possible that he wasn't sure that he hit Trayvon, and

       The only witnesses at the time of the shooting are Zimmerman and
       Martin so it really all comes down to whether or not you believe
       Zimmerman's story.   The prosecution's whole case is showing the
       total inconsistencies in Zimmerman's own statements along with
       showing why he had ill will towards Martin because he had profiled
       him as one of "them" that had been burglarizing the community.
       People really give too much weight to Good's testimony.  He had
       long gone back inside to call police before the shot was fired.
       In a fight, things can change in a real hurry.  Even if he did see
       Martin on top when he was outside, he has absolutely no idea what
       happened after he left.
       He never saw Zimmerman's head hitting the cement and he never
       actually saw any punches thrown.
       This case I believe comes down to whether or not the jury believes
       whether or not Zimmerman was telling the truth.

   since the cat's already out of the bag?  At this point it seems only
   large corporations and the "very important people" will have access.

     Watching the riveting cross-examination of Rachel Jeantel - Trayvon
     Martin's friend - about the last phone conversation between Trayvon
     Martin and her before he was killed, it occurred to me that the NSA
     must have the metadata for those frantic cellphone calls and also
     have them stored as they have been doing for years.  So, why
     couldn't the Defense or Prosecution make a motion to subpoena that
     metadata and those phone calls as stored and have that information
     provided to  the court so that the phone calls could actually be
     heard in the courtroom - sort of a 911 call recording without the
     presence of 911.

   Subpoenaing the metadata of the call with Rachel was probably one of

   this case

   Ordinarily, in a whodunit, we would want a story.

   This wasn't a whodunit. It was an "is it something we should excuse?"

   The roles in that sense , of  the prosecution and defense were reverse

   The prosecution was tasked with disproving the defense, and the defense
   was tasked with coming up with a believable story.

   I think the state showed their hands last week during the acquittal
   hearing: They smartly stated that they weren't tasked with disproving
   all stories that one could imagine as a self defense like the defense
   team tried to bring up this week.

   They were tasked with proving the defendant to be a liar, and that his
   stories, the actual one the defendant used before trial were lies.

   So, while the state did have the burden to disprove beyond  a
   reasonable doubt those claims that the defendant made, the smoke screen
   is to argue that they had to disprove theories by experts about what
   they think c ould have happened.

   Those stories are only possibilities. The only story that matters is
   the one Zimmerman said in his statements because the only other person
   who could really tell us is dead.

   I think itw as an intereesting strategy. Will it work? I don't know.
   THey had a lot of stumbles. But I am sure it makes more sense than the
   open ended "you fill in the blanks for the defendant although he's been
   found to lie to you"

   For getting this case for a second, one does that say: That we are
   going to fill in for a defendant who has a lied to us with stories that
   claim in some unjust way he's not guilty due to "reasonable doubt"

   Reasonable doubt isn't "any story I can create" It should be looking at
   what the actual defense is as far as his claims about what happened. TO
   do other wise, is perverse.

       claim of being in a situation where he feared for his life, is that
       where they can decide legitimately to convict on a charge? Because
       if he really wasn't in a situation where he could have reasonably
       feared for his life or great bodily injury, then it could not have

       Its the same argument the defense wants to use against Rachel, the
       young black girl. If one believes her earlier falsehoods means she
       isn't trust worthy, one is not required to believe their defense
       The prosecution made that point last week through its use of case
       law. That if they prove the defendant a liar, they don't need to
       prove anytthing else if the jury infers that means he lied about
       the self defense and his fear level.

   Like I said, it makes sense to me what the prosecution argued.
   Otherwise the defendant could essentially say anything to get off, and
   if we weer required to believe it, it hardly seems like real reasonable
   doubt.

       explained and really have nothing to do with what happened that
       night. She clearly didn't want to be on the stand - lied about her
       age - and I can certainly understand her not wanting to see her
       friend's body. I actually know people who have a similar problem
       and won't attend funerals.
       Now her testimony about what Trayvon said certainly doesn't make
       him look like a choir boy which makes her credible IMHO. In
       contrast, I think every lie that GZ has been caught in tends to
       provide benefit for his story of Trayvon being an aggressive "punk"
       and GZ actually being the victim who narrowly escaped death because
       he was able to draw his weapon and shoot the belligerent Trayvon.

       They were all serving of his innocents rather than small
       inconsistencies. You might expect small inconsistencies, but not
       things like whether he was ambushed or in an argument when the
       fight began. That to is evidence of a guilty mind. A jury may still
       feel he's not guilty, but, to me, at least, what the prosecution is
       doing is a valid strategy. My problem with it is execution again in
       terms of witness prep and focus at time.

     So, if the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that GZ is
     simply lying about the story of how things went down especially his
     claim of being in a situation where he feared for his life, is that
     where they can decide legitimately to convict on a charge?

   Despite what you might have read elsewhere in this thread, even if the
   jury doesn't completely buy the defence's version of what happened,
   they must still acquit if the don't buy the state's version to the
   exclusion of every reasonable doubt. In other words, if they think
   "Well, we don't quite believe Zimmerman, but we're not sure it went
   down the way the state said", they must acquit. If they think it's
   50/50 either way, they must acquit. If they think it pretty much went
   down the way the state said, but have a reasonable doubt that maybe
   Zimmerman's story is true, or in fact ANY reasonable scenario where
   they believe he might have been acting in self defence, they must
   acquit.

   Beyond a reasonable doubt is a very, very high standard for the state
   to meet. The reason prosecutor's have such a high conviction rate is
   that they generally don't bring cases to trial where they have don't
   very strong evidence that they are confident they can secure a
   conviction.

       What is being decided is the credibility of Zimmerman's claims that
       it was necessary for his survival.
       I tend to agree that the facts of the case put Zimmerman's lawyers
       in a position where the onus is on them to prove something. If they
       fail to convince us of Zimmerman's story, the undisputed facts
       convict Zimmerman.
       If I'm on the jury, I'm thinking, "Zimmerman's team didn't convince
       me the shooting was justified -- Guilty."
       No one on the jury has reasonable doubt that Zimmerman shot Travon.
       That's not the construct of this case. The prosecution doesn't need
       to prove that - Zimmerman's confessed it.
       I'm thinking this is what lawyers call an "affirmative defense?"

       is they only have to disprove the defendant's actual claims about
       self defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Not a generic notion of
       self defense.
       the defense argument is more along the lines "anything is possible"
       and ignoring or down playing all the contradictory statements
       already made by the defendant pre-trial as to what he claims
       happened. the defense is playing "what if" at trial. The
       prosecution is playing 'what did the defendant say happened that

   The victim is on trial in a sense--that's the reality--and the main
   question for the jury is whether the defendant was acting reasonably
   under the circumstances.  Showing that Z could not manage a straight,
   coherent story is pretty much their main job.  He helped them immensely
   by not testifying in court and subjecting himself to cross examination.
    That fact is obvious to the jury even if the prosecution can't talk
   about it.

   I recall my crim law professor saying that a prosecutor's case should
   be built around his/her closing argument, which in this case boils down
   to Z being a malevolent liar.

   I still think the 2nd degree murder verdict is a reach, although the
   state made a persuasive case.  A manslaughter conviction seems very

       The case is still close, however, because the prosecution screwed
       up in how they executed their strategy rather than in the soundness
       of the strategy.
       The thing that helped them immensely was the fact he kept changing
       his story, from which one can logically infer a guilt because of
       it. If he had shut his mouth up, he probably would be in a stronger
       position.
       The only reason why this is a close call to me is (1) race (2) the
       prosecution executed poorly (including poor prep of witnesses) and
       (3) defense smoke screen
       However, the core argument: If you don't believe the defendant, why
       are we required to believe his many inconsistent claims about what
       happened?
       People keep saying reasonable doubt, but I don't understand why
       reasonable doubt requires believing a liar and killer, and he's the
       only source of what really happened that night as far as his claims
       of self defense.

   If I understand correctly, assault does not require physical force, it
   only requires that you take actions that cause fear in your victim.  I
   think that what Zimmerman did, shadowing the victim with his car could
   be considered an assault in the legal sense.

       defense, arguing that Zimmerman "provoked" the fight with Martin by

       the use of force by Martin, Zimmerman had to use actual force, or
       threaten actual force first -- it is clear under the law, they
       argued, that you can't "provoke" the use of force against you by
       following someone.  They argued that there was no evidence at trial
       that Zimmerman was the first to use or threaten actual force, so
       the instruction on that law should not be given.

       attacked who first.  I think that when a person has been stalking

       right to defend yourself against him, even if it involves jumping
       him and pummeling him.   Pummeling isn't committing murder. Trayvon
       did not commit murder, but Zimmerman did.  Assuming Zimmerman was
       being assaulted and not Trayvon, which also is unclear and no one
       seems to actually know that fact, why would he be screaming if he
       had a gun? How could Trayvon be screaming if he was trying to
       wrestle the gun away (on which his fingerprints were not found
       btw)?  Why would the screaming stop simultaneously with the shot if
       it wasn't Trayvon screaming?
       I really can't understand how Trayvon has no right to stand his
       ground.  Does having that right only apply to white people?
       I also wonder about Zimmerman's "calmness" when the police arrived
       and how he had his exculpatory explanation of self-defense at the
       ready.  Really, I can't even understand how anyone could see this a
       different way, much less the legal profession.   The whole thing is
       just a racist travesty. If the races of these two men were

 Why would he be screaming if he had a gun? ([3959]0+ / 0-)
       I can think of two reasons:
       1. He didn't want to shoot the kid and so he was hoping someone
       would come and break up the fight
       2. He couldn't reach his gun initially because he was being
       straddled and struck.  At some point there was an opening that put
       his gun within his reach, and he grabbed it.
       I'm leaning towards #2, but of course nobody except Zimmerman
       knows.
       As for Zimmerman's "calmness", think about the conspiracy theories
       after Newtown, and how the NRA folks were saying that the parents
       didn't look like they were grieving enough.  Think of how absurd we
       thought that was because not all people react to trauma and stress
       in the same way.  Well, why would that be different here?

       If Zimmerman was brandishing his weapon, yes that would be true.
       But absent threatening Martin with his gun, or striking him, under
       Gibb v State Martin had no right to physically attack Zimmerman if
       his firearm was concealed and his was asking questions, regardless

       From the friend's testimony it sounds like Zimmerman approaches
       Martin and grabs him with Martin saying "Get off, get off".    The
       fight ensued after that with Zimmerman getting the worse of it and
       like the wimpy, big-talk he pulls out his gun to end the fight.
       Doesn't sound like self-defense to me, more like someone got their
       ego bruised by a kid that weighed 50 pounds less than him and then
       pulled out his gun to show the kid who was the boss.

 Yes. I agree. I also wonder ([3975]0+ / 0-)
       how you could be screaming for your life while at the same time
       trying to wrest your gun from behind your back.  I try to put
       myself in that scenario and I can't because the concentration
       needed to get the gun would surely interfere with my ability to
       keep screaming or at least cause my voice to become modulated if i
       were to try to do both.
       Anyway, i don't think it makes any difference at all who jumped who
       or who was on top.   One person had no gun, was on the phone
       minding his own business walking home to his father's house. the
       other person was stalking him, had already decided that he had
       criminal intent and used profanity to describe him even though all
       he had seen was a kid walking down the street.   He was told by the
       911 person not to confront the kid and not to keep following him.
       He disobeyed. He brought his loaded gun out of his car with him
       when he approached the kid.  He did not tell him why he was
       following him.   If that were a white kid and a black man, you can
       bet your britches that the attitudes of those defending Zimmerman
       would be diametrically opposed to what they are now.   It's racism
       and I think it's disgusting.

   reacting to physical aggression by GZ else how do you explain Rachel's
   testimony of Trayvon shouting to "get off, get off"? I can see Trayvon
   having words with his pursuer, then turning to leave and GZ, not
   wanting to let him escape, tries to restrain him. "Get off, get off!"
   If that actually happened, then GZ would be the aggressor. I mean
   Trayvon's almost at his destination but it's not his actual home so how
   comfortable would he be in starting a fight with a creepy ass cracker
   in that situation? Unless you have reason to believe that Trayvon
   actually was an aggressive "punk" as GZ claims.

   So fucking what. I also believe
   1) Zimmerman racially profiled Trayvon though I think it is irrelevant
   for the manslaughter charge.
   2)Zimmerman lied about many things that happened between the time he
   hung up the call and he was on the ground under Trayvon. The bushes
   comment being such a whopper of a life that I can't believe the state
   didn't make more of a case out of that lie instead of focusing on
   unprovable things like who lied for help.
   3) Considering Zimmerman lied about bushes, his whole self defense
   explanation starts to fall apart. You have to be skeptical about every
   one of his statements like Trayvon saying "you are going to die" or
   "you got me".
   4) You can't ignore the fact that he said "these punks get away with
   it".

   I dont think Zimmerman set out to shoot someone. BUt I feel he always
   had that itch to shoot some black thug Dirty Harry style and when he
   found himself on the bottom pof the pile, all inhibitions to restrain
   oneself in ending a fight with a gun were gone because he gave no value
   to Martin's life.

   I think he lied about the number of times his head was pounded. I think
   with the concrete, it is easy to get those scrapes even with a scuffle

   The prosecutors were a joke. Going for 2nd degree murder hurt their
   case. I will be happy with a hung jury at this point because that means
   Zimmerman will have to spend money on a future trial and Zimmerman will
   have to look over his shoulder every time he steps out on the street
   because someone could very well feel like Ziermman is a threat to their
   safety because of his trigger happy reputaitn.

 but where did Martin come from to surprise him? ([4108]0+ / 0-)

   According to Zimmerman's own testimony he walked right past the path
   where Martin supposedly was.   Look at the area at the "T" - there is
   absolutely no place to hide.

   If Martin wasn't right at the "T" then to surprise Zimmerman he would
   have to be running which Zimmerman would have heard and would not have
   been surprised.   It just doesn't make any sense how Zimmerman could
   have been surprised which is why he said at one point that he "jumped
   out of the bushes".    Of course, the only bushes are about 3 feet tall
   and located against the town-homes which is why the comment is so

 If it was dark, he could have missed him ([4112]0+ / 0-)
       In that area there are no streetlights.  He says his flashlight
       wasn't working.
       Since it was raining the best he would have had is maybe some
       ambient light leaking out of some windows and maybe a backdoor
       light or two that was on.  Based on the crime scene
       photos--although those were taken a bit later--the area does look
       like it would be really dark.
       It could be that he is lying about that whole part, but there is no
       evidence that I am aware of to really show that, and his version of
       events because of the darkness still seems plausible.
       I mean, here's a photo taken at night with a flash. Look at how
       dark it is there.

 Yup - there are some things that don't ([4135]0+ / 0-)
       quite make sense to me in Henderson's story.

     Erik Henderson, the Butte long-haul trucker who gave Jasper a ride
     from Idaho and let him stay in his home, said the body armor was his
     from when he was a contract convoy trucker in Iraq. The guns were
     hunting weapons, he said.

     Henderson, 46, said Jasper described himself as an "anarchist."
     "But you hear that from a lot of college-aged kids these days," he
     said, adding that Jasper was friendly and "seemed normal."
     ...
     Henderson discovered his pickup, guns and body armor missing Tuesday
     after returning home from 11 days on the road.
     Jasper, he said, had left a message saying he was driving to Seattle
     to "argue with some legislators about some issues he was upset at."
       So when exactly did Henderson discover his truck and weapons
       missing? When did he give Jasper the ride? If Henderson had just
       returned from an 11 day trip, when did he let Jasper stay at his
       place? Was Jasper there by himself the whole 11 days?
       But there are few sanctions against someone for failing to keep
       their guns secured. And because private transfers don't require any
       background check all the Mr. Henderson's of the world are free to
       rely on their own trusting natures when the leave their guns lying
       around and invite crazy or angry drifters into their homes.

       Presumption of innocence is for the government. You may feel free
       to employ it yourself, should you so desire, but the rest of us
       have absolutely no obligation to do so, if we don't feel that it is
       appropriate in any given case.
       People like you misuse this concept in much the same way that
       'freedom of the press' is misused. Yes, people have the right to
       say almost anything they want, and not be restrained by the
       government. And I have the right to think that they're an asshole
       for saying something, and if I have the power to do so, I have the
       right to (e.g.) organize a boycott of their businesses based on
       what they say. The government can't. I can.
       In the exact same way, if I see that someone was accused of a
       crime, and I think that accusation was credible, I am free to act
       on that information. If, for example, I find that one of the people
       I am interviewing for a position teaching a preschool was arrested,
       but not convicted, of killing an 8-year-old five years ago, and I
       look at the fact and think it likely that he was guilty, it is
       entirely my option to make the decision not to hire him based on
       that fact.
       So, you can go ahead and make your decisions based on
       innocent-until-proven-guilty. (Although my best guess, based on
       reading your comments here, is that should he be convicted, you
       will probably not accept that fact with equanimity.) But the rest
       of us are entirely free to make our own decisions based on our own
       examination of the facts.
       And my examination of the facts tells me that you are either a
       troll, or someone with waaaaay too much time on his hands and a
       pathological need to be right about everything. Either way, my
       examination of the facts further tells me that you would benefit
       from some meditation classes.

     Jackie Robinson in 1946

     On October 23, 1945, the Brooklyn Dodgers announced that they had
     signed Jackie Robinson assigning him to their International League
     team, the Montreal Royals.

     Branch Rickey, Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager believing he "knew"
     Florida, thought his team could train there ruffling as few feathers
     as possible. Robinson and his wife were instructed by Rickey not to
     try to stay at any Sanford hotels. He and his wife didn't eat out at
     any restaurants not deemed "Negro restaurants." He didn't even dress
     in the same locker room as his teammates.

     As soon as the citizenry became aware of Robinson's presence, the
     mayor of Sanford was confronted by a "large group of white
     residents" who "demanded that Robinson...be run out of town."

     On March 5, 1946, the Royals were informed that they would not be
     permitted to take the field as an integrated group. Rickey was
     concerned for Robinson's life and sent him to stay in Daytona Beach.
     His daughter, Sharon Robinson, remembered being told, "The Robinsons
     were run out of Sanford, Florida, with threats of violence."

     In his 1993 book, "A Hard Road to Glory: A History Of The African
     American Athlete: Baseball" tennis great Arthur Ashe wrote in
     response, Rickey "moved the entire Dodger pre-season camp from
     Sanford, Florida, to Daytona Beach due to the oppressive conditions
     of Sanford."

       patrol, doped up on hollow point ammo, locked and loaded?
       I wonder if the Martin family can sue whoever promoted this guy to
       "Captain" of their security.

   Zimmermans claim that Martin covered his mouth while reaching for his
   gun is totally bogus as the 911 recording show that there was screaming
   right up until the gunshot.

       44 seconds of screaming in a one minute period, and Martin was
       supposedly trying to cut off the guy's breath AND reach for the gun
       at the same time. With his third hand.
       The screams continued until the shot. Then...silence.

       the defense laid out their "scenerio" and pretty much sucked all
       the energy into their story being the groundwork for everyone to
       discuss. That sucks for the prosecution as pieces of the fight
       story the defense told becomes 'what happened', even though nobody
       really knows. I thought today the prosecutor did a great job of
       looking at the story in a different way - I hope it wasn't too
       late.

   I have always believed that Zimmerman was on top and that the minor
   scratches were part of a scuffle. There is no physically possible way
   to get at the gun other wise. He shot directly at the heart and then
   holstered his weapon. Then turned the body over. That to me is obvious.
   What isn't so obvious is whether there will be a conviction. This is
   more of a case against SYG, than anything else, and the jury in their
   heart of hearts knows this. If Z walks, the SYG walks along with him
   and it's open season on who ever displeases you, as long as there are
   no witnesses. Remember, this fat fuck was never charged initially, it
   was looked at as nothing out of the ordinary by the Sanford Police
   Dept. It amounted to good live Sport!

   will use common sense. There is not one instance where it has been
   recorded that Zimmerman was upset. Even cops suffer after they shoot
   people, it's traumatic, even if it is by the book 100%. I see no
   remorse, Zimmerman is flat lined.

   Common sense alerts us to the needless loss of Trayvon, his parents'
   suffering, the upset of the community, ideological and racial tensions,
   and all the other fallout [including the trial] which drags a community
   through the mud and costs them real money.

 talkleft jeralyn's take on the case ([4593]0+ / 0-)

   an excerpt from: [4594]Benjamin Crump: Who Screamed Doesn't Matter -
   TalkLeft: The Politics Of Crime

     Now that the evidence has been presented, my previously expressed
     opinions on this case have only become more solidified. Looking to
     the future, and the legacy of this case, here is what I see. Keep in
     mind this is only my opinion.

     Whether George Zimmerman is acquitted or convicted, and I am not
     making any predictions before hearing closing arguments and reading
     the jury instructions, the legacy of this case will be that the
     media never gets it right, and worse, that a group of lawyers, with
     the aid of a public relations team, who had a financial stake in the
     outcome of pending and anticipated civil litigation, were allowed to
     commandeer control of Florida's criminal justice system, in pursuit
     of a divisive, personal agenda.

     Their transformation of a tragic but spontaneous shooting into the
     crime of the century, and their relentless demonization of the
     person they deemed responsible, not for a tragic killing, but for
     "cold-blooded murder," has called into question the political
     motives and ethics of the officials serving in the Executive branch
     of Florida's government, ruined the career of other public
     officials, turned the lives of the Zimmerman family, who are as
     innocent as their grieving clients, into a nightmare, and along the
     way, set back any chance of a rational discussion of the very cause
     they were promoting, probably for years.

     The problems of racial disparity and arbitrary enforcement of our
     criminal laws are real, systemic and need to be addressed. Criminal
     defense lawyers see it and fight to correct it every day. From
     charging decisions to plea offers to sentences, the system is not
     fair and everybody knows it.

     But this case has never been representative of those problems. And
     perhaps most unfortunate of all, as a result of the false narrative
     created by the lawyers for grieving parents who tragically lost
     their son -- a narrative perpetuated by a complicit and
     ratings-hungry media -- any attempt at meaningful reform is likely
     to fall on deaf ears for years to come.

   my bolding. this case does not represent any liberal causes. it has
   been twisted into that by a rush to judgment before even knowing the
   evidence.

   my two cents.

   Oh it's Sanford FL. A terrible history of race problems.

   I was not surprised when nothing happen at first. I said it 's Sanford
   FL.

   I would be surprised and hope I'm wrong once about the confederate
   wannabes of Sanford/Seminole FL. The jury is made up of that.

   That just because you don't like the color of a person's skin doesn't

       reasonable doubt, that Zimmerman did NOT act in self-defense.
       That's Florida law.
       Here are two authorities for that.  First is the case of
       [4750]Falwell v. State (citing a number of other cases).
       Second, see the Florida standard jury instructions (big pdf
       [4751]here).  In section 3.6(f), you will find the following, to be
       read in all self-defense cases:

     If in your consideration of the issue of self-defense you have a
     reasonable doubt on the question of whether the defendant was
     justified in the use of deadly force, you should find the defendant
     not guilty.
     However, if from the evidence you are convinced that the defendant
     was not justified in the use of deadly force, you should find [him]
     [her] guilty if all the elements of the charge have been proved.
       That means that if the jury is not sure, beyond a reasonable doubt,
       that Zimmerman did NOT act in self-defense, the jury should acquit.

       You will hear MOM talk about this a lot tomorrow.

       that the lawyers know exactly what the jury instructions will be
       when they give their closings, and so that they can USE  those

   -- i noticed a reaction from him, like he knew de la rionda got it

   react to something that's been said in the trial. mr. bluezen has said
   from the beginning that gz went for his gun, not his phone, & that's
   what started the fight. tm saw what he was doing, reacted, & tried to
   stop him from using it.

   also, did anyone see gz's dad mugging it up for the jury? i saw him
   rolling his eyes at the ceiling & smirking everytime de la rionda
   scored a good point. i really thought the judge was going to throw him
   out of court. i'm sure the jury saw it, too, & if i was on the jury, i

       whoever is providing the feed (or maybe there are several?) is
       permitting that kind of coverage of the gallery. The short-term
       pleasing of the audience this way in one case cuts against their
       long-range goal of cameras in more courtrooms, particularly
       federal. It's exactly the kind of thing the federal judiciary uses
       to say "not in our house." Steve Brill worked so hard to establish
       credibility when Court TV started, and this sort of thing cuts
       against what he used to get in the door. (The question of whether
       they should be able to keep the cameras out is a different one, of

       remember watching a trial that had gallery shots like this one. in

       plus, the camera caught the shot of the witness (donnelly) sitting

       witnesses hearing trial testimony -- & it's my understanding the

   attack on himself.  I've seen that in the thread again today.  That
   argument has been rejected by the Court.  If you watched the charge
   conference this morning (see about halfway in [4814]this video and the
   following videos), the State argued that the Court should give an
   instruction on a claim of [4815]self-defense by an aggressor.  (It's a
   higher standard for a defendant claiming self-defense.) The State
   claimed that Zimmerman "provoked" the use of force by Martin by
   following him and perhaps "confronting" him.   The defense, relying on
   the [4816]Gibbs case (which I've cited here numerous times) argued that
   "provoked" means use or threat of force, and that there was no evidence
   that Zimmerman was the first to use or threaten force.  They said that
   because there was no evidence that Zimmerman provoked the use of force
   against himself, that instruction should not be given.

   The Court said it [4817]would not give the instruction.

   You notice that today, BDLR said only that Zimmerman "started it" by
   following Martin.  He could not argue anything more than that (for
   example, he could not argue that Martin was "defending himself" against
   Zimmerman when he hit Zimmerman) in light of the judge's ruling that
   there was no basis for an instruction based on the contention that
   Zimmerman legally provoked the use of force by Martin.

   That argument was put to bed by the Court today.   In my view, this was
   a very significant development today that few people have focused on.

       Never argue with an idiot. They will drag you down to their level
       and beat you with experience.

 Jury of women have to be thinking...... ([4860]6+ / 0-)

   If a young black male circled my wife's car, she would lock the doors
   and leave. I wonder if the women on the jury are thinking "Why would he
   get out of the vehicle and follow the guy?" It is sad but it is America
   and how people think. I don't understand it at all. Here in FL I can
   shoot someone and as long as I kill them and there is no witness, I
   walk????? The jury needs to send a message to the other George Zims out
   there that think this way. You can't shoot someone because you lost a
   fight you started. If he walks, I fear this will become a revolving
   door of "I was protecting myself" sheeyot.

 This was murder. ([4869]4+ / 0-)

   For the last year and a half, I've been following this case and
   dissecting, with others, the evidence in discovery. We've gone through
   it and compared it to Florida law.  I've long thought that the 2nd
   degree murder charge was warranted, even if it turned out not to be
   provable beyond a reasonable doubt.  And I thought manslaughter was
   likely the best chance at a conviction.

   I thought the wailing on the 911 call would be a wash.  I figured there
   would be no way to prove one way or the other who it belonged to.

   Tonight, thanks to an error by the press corps in the live feed after
   court went into recess, I saw a photograph of Trayvon's face at the
   crime scene, for the first time (it was part of the PowerPoint
   presentation that the state used in its closing arguments).  There was
   a tear stain running all the way down his left cheek.

   Because it only flashed on the screen for a second, I did go see if I
   could find it elsewhere, and I found another photograph, from a
   slightly different angle.  This one showed that he had a runny nose
   when he died.

   I'm sure some would say that those fluids appeared after he was shot,
   but the fact that the tear fell down his face gives lie to that
   suggestion.

   There can be no doubt that Trayvon was the one wailing for his life.
   This was murder, without a doubt.
