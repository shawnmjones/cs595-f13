     * Disclosure unprecedented as intelligence officials seek to be more
       transparent
     * National security court has periodically renewed collection of
       telephone data

   Washington (CNN) -- A top-secret court has renewed the authority of
   U.S. national security officials to collect telephone data as part of
   an anti-terror surveillance program that was exposed by intelligence
   leaker Edward Snowden.

   In an unprecedented disclosure, the Office of the Director of National
   Intelligence said it had decided to declassify and announce the program
   renewal, which occurs periodically but is never publicized.
   Former intelligence worker Edward Snowden revealed himself as the
   source of documents outlining a massive effort by the NSA to track cell
   phone calls and monitor the e-mail and Internet traffic of virtually
   all Americans. He says he just wanted the public to know what the
   government was doing. "Even if you're not doing anything wrong, you're
   being watched and recorded," he said. Snowden has been granted
   temporary asylum in Russia after initially fleeing to Hong Kong. He has
   been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S.
   Espionage Act, over the leaks. Former intelligence worker Edward

   Military analyst Daniel Ellsberg leaked the 7,000-page Pentagon Papers
   in 1971. The top-secret documents revealed that senior American
   leaders, including three presidents, knew the Vietnam War was an
   unwinnable, tragic quagmire. Further, they showed that the government
   had lied to Congress and the public about the progress of the war.
   Ellsberg surrendered to authorities and was charged as a spy. During
   his trial, the court learned that President Richard Nixon's
   administration had embarked on a campaign to discredit Ellsberg,
   illegally wiretapping him and breaking into his psychiatrist's office.
   All charges against him were dropped. Since then he has lived a
   relatively quiet life as a respected author and lecturer. Military

   Starting in 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service studied untreated
   syphilis in black men who thought they were getting free health care.
   The patients weren't told of their affliction or sufficiently treated.
   Peter Buxtun, who worked for the Public Health Service, relayed
   information about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment to a reporter in
   1972, which halted the 40-year study. His testimony at congressional
   hearings led to an overhaul of the Health, Education and Welfare rules
   concerning work with human subjects. A class-action lawsuit was settled
   out-of-court for $10 million, with the U.S. government promising free
   medical care to survivors and their families. Here, participants talk
   with a study coordinator. Starting in 1932, the U.S. Public Health

   In 2005, retired deputy FBI director Mark Felt revealed himself to be
   the whistle-blower "Deep Throat" in the Watergate scandal. He
   anonymously assisted Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob
   Woodward with many of their stories about the Nixon administration's
   cover-up after the June 1972 break-in at the Democratic National
   Committee headquarters. The stories sparked a congressional
   investigation that eventually led to President Nixon's resignation in
   1974. The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage. Felt was
   convicted on unrelated conspiracy charges in 1980 and eventually
   pardoned by President Ronald Reagan before slipping into obscurity for
   the next quarter-century. He died in 2008 at age 95. In 2005, retired

   Mordechai Vanunu, who worked as a technician at Israel's nuclear
   research facility, leaked information to a British newspaper and led
   nuclear arms analysts to conclude that Israel possessed a stockpile of
   nuclear weapons. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its weapons
   program. An Israeli court convicted Vanunu in 1986 after Israeli
   intelligence agents captured him in Italy. He was sentenced to 18 years
   in prison. Since his release in 2004, he has been arrested on a number
   of occasions for violating terms of his parole. Mordechai Vanunu, who

   President Ronald Reagan addresses the media in 1987, months after the
   disclosure of the Iran-Contra affair. A secret operation carried out by
   an American military officer used proceeds from weapons sales to Iran
   to fund the anti-communist Contras in Nicaragua and attempted to secure
   the release of U.S. hostages held by Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.

   Tobacco industry executive Jeffrey Wigand issued a memo to his company
   in 1992 about his concerns regarding tobacco additives. He was fired in
   March 1993 and subsequently contacted by "60 Minutes" and persuaded to
   tell his story on CBS. He claimed that Brown & Williamson knowingly
   used additives that were carcinogenic and addictive and spent millions
   covering it up. He also testified in a landmark case in Mississippi
   that resulted in a $246 billion settlement from the tobacco industry.

   For 10 years, Frederic Whitehurst complained mostly in vain about
   practices at the FBI's world-renowned crime lab, where he worked. His
   efforts eventually led to a 1997 investigation that found lab agents
   produced inaccurate and scientifically flawed testimony in major cases,
   including the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings. The
   Justice Department recommended major reforms but also criticized
   Whitehurst for "overstated and incendiary" allegations. He also faced
   disciplinary action for refusing to cooperate with an investigation
   into how some of his allegations were leaked to a magazine. After a
   yearlong paid suspension he left the bureau in 1998 with a settlement
   worth more than $1.16 million. For 10 years, Frederic Whitehurst

   FBI whistle-blower Coleen Rowley accused the bureau of hindering

   plans for the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. In 2002 she fired off
   a 13-page letter to FBI Director Robert Mueller and flew to Washington
   to hand-deliver copies to two members of the Senate Intelligence
   Committee and meet with committee staffers. The letter accused the
   bureau of deliberately undermining requests to look into Zacarias
   Moussaoui, the only person convicted in the United States of playing a
   role in the attacks. She testified in front of Congress and the 9/11
   Commission about the FBI's mishandling of information. Rowley was
   selected as one of Time magazine's People of the Year in 2002, along
   with whistle-blowers Sherron Watkins of Enron and Cynthia Cooper of

   Sherron Watkins, a former vice president at Enron, sent an anonymous
   letter to founder Kenneth Lay in 2001 warning him the company had
   accounting irregularities. The memo eventually reached the public and
   she later testified before Congress about her concerns and the
   company's wrongdoings. More than 4,000 Enron employees lost their jobs,
   and many also lost their life savings, when the energy giant declared
   bankruptcy in 2001. Investors lost billions of dollars. An
   investigation in 2002 found that Enron executives reaped millions of
   dollars from off-the-books partnerships and violated basic rules of
   accounting and ethics. Many were sentenced to prison for their roles in

   had used $3.8 billion in questionable accounting entries to inflate
   earnings over the past five quarters. By the end of 2003, the total
   fraud was estimated to be $11 billion. The company filed for bankruptcy
   protection and five executives ended up in prison. Cooper started her
   own consulting firm and told her story in the book "Extraordinary

   In 2003, federal air marshal Robert MacLean anonymously tipped off an
   MSNBC reporter that because of budget concerns, the TSA was temporarily
   suspending missions that would require marshals to stay in hotels just
   days after they were briefed about a new "potential plot" to hijack
   U.S. airliners. The news caused an immediate uproar on Capitol Hill and
   the TSA retreated, withdrawing the scheduling cuts before they went
   into effect. MacLean was later investigated and fired for the

   Joe Darby is the whistle-blower behind the Abu Ghraib prison abuse

   for photos from their travels so he could share them with family.
   Instead, he was given photos of prisoner abuse. Darby eventually
   alerted the U.S. military command, triggering an investigation and
   global outrage when the scandal came to light in 2004. Graner was
   sentenced to 10 years in prison for his part in the abuse. He was
   released in 2011 after serving 6Â½ years of his sentence. The military
   and members of Darby's own family ostracized him, calling him a
   traitor. Eventually he and his wife had to enter protective custody.

   acquitted of the most serious charge -- aiding the enemy. Manning is
   set to speak in his defense when he takes the stand during the
   sentencing phase of his court-martial on Wednesday, August 14. He could
   face up to 90 years in prison if the judge imposes the maximum

   Snowden leaked classified information about the National Security
   Agency program to media outlets last month and then fled the country.
   He has been charged with espionage and remains in [41]diplomatic limbo
   at the Moscow airport after seeking temporary asylum.

   His detailing of the surveillance effort that required communications
   giant Verizon to turn over caller information triggered outrage from
   civil libertarians, certain members of Congress and privacy groups
   concerned with the sweeping nature of the telephone snooping and a
   companion effort that monitors e-mails.

   [42]Silicon Valley to feds: Disclose your data requests

   Officials have said metadata on overseas-related communications does
   not include content but provides information about numbers dialed and
   received as well as length, date and time of calls.

   President Barack Obama says the government is not listening in on
   calls, and other officials have said said the massive collection
   program has helped to detect terror plots.

   The national intelligence office did not say when the periodic renewal
   order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was handed down,
   but NSA legal authority under the Patriot Act to collect telephone
   metadata surveillance was due to expire on Friday.

   The new transparency appears to be an effort by the Obama
   administration to be more forthcoming about the program, the
   administration of which was sharply criticized this week by members of
   the House Judiciary Committee.

   [43]Opinion: Your biggest secrets are up for grabs

   One influential Republican member of the panel, troubled by the
   sweeping nature of how the telephone surveillance had been carried out,
   questioned whether Congress would act when the surveillance program
   comes up for renewal in 2015.

   Following the Snowden leaks, certain information about telephone
   collection was declassified "in order to provide the public with a more
   thorough and balanced understanding of the program," a statement from
   the national intelligence office said.

   [44]Privacy? Forget it, we're all celebrities online now

   "Consistent with his prior declassification decision and in light of
   the significant and continuing public interest" in the matter, the
   office decided to declassify and disclose publicly that it had filed an
   application to renew telephone metadata collection "in bulk" and that
   the court "renewed that authority."

   "The administration is undertaking a careful and thorough review of
   whether and to what extent additional information or documents
   pertaining to this program may be declassified, consistent with the
   protection of national security," the statement said.

   Although Verizon was singled out in the Snowden leak on telephone
   surveillance, it is believed that the government obtains similar orders
   for other telecommunications providers. All must be periodically
   renewed by the FISA court.

   No communications companies were mentioned in the intelligence office
   statement on Friday.
