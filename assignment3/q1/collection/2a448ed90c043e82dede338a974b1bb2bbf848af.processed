Charting a Course to End Malaria

     Today is the last day of the Malaria Forum, hosted by the Bill &
     Melinda Gates Foundation to rally the malaria community around the
     goal of malaria elimination and eventual eradication.

   In the past 10 years, the number of people who die from [15]malaria has
   declined 20 percent.

   For the past three days, the global malaria community has been meeting
   in Seattle, talking about what it's going to take to get rid of the
   other 80 percent. The eradication of malaria is an ambitious goal and a
   long-term goal--but a goal Melinda and I are 100 percent committed to.

   People used to say eradication was impossible, but we remain optimistic
   because human beings have a spectacular ability to innovate.

   The tool that's most associated with the recent progress against
   malaria is the long-lasting bed net. Bed nets are a fantastic
   innovation. But we can do even better. We can invent new ways to
   control the mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite.

   One of the problems with nets is that they can be uncomfortable to
   sleep under, so people sometimes chose not to. Researchers are testing
   spatial repellents that drive mosquitoes away right now. A family could
   hang a small coil from the ceiling and be protected, without having to
   accept a terrible night's sleep.

   One innovation the malaria community has been pursuing for decades is a
   vaccine. We have never had a vaccine for a parasitic disease, and the
   scientific complexity is dizzying. But at this week's meetings I was
   pleased to announce interim [16]results from the final-phase of a trial
   for a vaccine candidate called RTS,S. Among five to 17-month-old
   children, the vaccine prevented clinical malaria (which was defined as
   the presence of fever and parasites in a child who was ill and brought
   to a health facility for care), in 56 percent of trial participants
   over a period of one year. We still need to analyze the complete data
   when it's available, but this vaccine could be licensed and protecting
   children by 2015.

   We'll keep on innovating and improving on this vaccine, but these
   results are a huge milestone in the history of our fight against
   malaria.

   The malaria parasite has been killing children and sapping the strength
   of whole populations for tens of thousands of years. It is impossible
   to calculate the harm malaria has done to the world. But we have the
   ability to make generation after generation of better tools, and we can
   chart a course to end malaria.

Annual Letter: A Health Emergency

   The world's making progress against malaria, neonatal deaths and
   HIV/AIDS, but not enough. In his 2011 letter as co-chair of the Bill &
   Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill explains why he's willing to be viewed
   as a troublemaker by people who are happy with the status quo.
