Letters to change the world

   Pupils around the world have written letters explaining how they would
   change the world and discussed them on the BBC's World Have Your Say
   with special guest Bill Gates.

   You can listen to the programme [31]here. Read extracts below:

Solomeina, Julia, Inna and Svetlana write from School #108 in Ekatarinburg,
Russia. Their school is twinned with Fairlands Middle School in the UK

   Pupils from School 108, Ekatrinburg

   Solomeina writes: "Problems. We can get rid of them only if we find a
   proper solution. And very often this solution requires money.

   I hope that people pretending to be leaders of nations know what should
   be done. And the problem is not about money, it's about people. I
   cannot change people, but people can change the world.

   I think that most of these problems can be solved by improving the
   system of education and this in turn could make future generations more
   capable in making the world healthy, wealthy and wise. I am ready to
   join the team to develop a new education model."

   Inna writes: "Indifference and inertness spoil the world. That's why I
   think that to change the world, you have to change yourself.
   Pupils from School 108, Ekatrinburg

   You have to be tolerant, active, thinking, able to make and achieve
   goals. Then, you will find medicine for diseases; you will study,
   think, invent and create. You will share your energy with people and
   lead them.

   You have to just stop sitting in your comfortable chairs and start
   doing something: either act or study, communicate and work."

   "[In Russia], our education is free and available to everyone," writes
   Svetlana.

   But university education is not always free. Now it is becoming more
   and more difficult to enter a good university, so people who don't have
   money, can't afford to study in a university. Then they don't have a
   chance to get a well-paid job.

   I think that our government should analyse the situation and offer
   support to those who have good abilities but don't have money to pay
   for their education."
   Pupils from School 108, Ekatrinburg

   Julia writes: "I wish our world would be more polite than it is now. We
   must use our energy for good actions. For example: we must build more
   museums and other cultural centres. We must remember our past and
   respect it.

   We mustn't destroy our nature. That's incorrect. We have to protect our
   mountains, forests and lakes. They are very beautiful.

   I hate people who drink alcohol, take drugs and destroy humanity
   themselves. I would destroy all bars and bases with drugs. I would
   implement cruel punishment for criminals and for drug pushing.

   Then, I would stop all the wars... many innocent people die. We mustn't
   quarrel with each other... We have to learn to find compromises."

Almost a year on from the start of the Libyan uprising, pupils from Benghazi
in Libya share how they want to change the world...

   Sara writes: "I was not a proud Libyan, I didn't love my country. I was
   ashamed. I didn't ever think that would change. But it did change, I
   changed; the hope and the fight in people changed me. Their actions
   changed me. I have seen that change so I know it is possible.
   The Libyan uprising began in Benghazi The Libyan uprising began in
   Benghazi

   Right now I am a part of Libya's history and its future. My voice means
   something, I can shout to the whole world and everybody can hear me.
   From not ever thinking they had a voice, to just a glimpse of hope;
   they rose, they fought, they battled. We changed the way we view
   ourselves. We're equal.

   You can become the change. Fight for your right, your voice and your
   freedom. Accept and change; learn. Become the change!"

   Yomna writes: "Being a Libyan teenage girl who has just been through a
   traumatic revolution which has changed my perspective on life, I am now
   seeing things in a new light. Unfortunately, I do not like what I see.

   All over the world, there are people who are having a hard time dealing
   with racial and religious discrimination.

   Being a Muslim is something I am proud of. I am proud of what I am and
   nothing can take that away from me. Some people's first impression of a
   Muslim is one word - terrorist. Terrorism has nothing to do with Islam
   and I think everyone should know that. The word Islam means peace and a
   Muslim is a moderate human being, forgiving and compassionate.

   Are we really that different? I have accepted everyone around me. Can
   you do the same?"

   "The world would be a much better place if we all started thinking
   about each other instead of ourselves," writes Rola.

   Powerful countries should help other countries to improve instead of
   always competing to be the best. We should spread our wealth around and
   give more opportunities to other people. We can all make a difference
   in this world if we stop thinking selfishly and contribute to other
   people in meaningful ways.

   If I could have any wish it would be to amplify the sense of empathy of
   the entire human race."

   Nourhan writes: "What is change? Change is to become different or to
   make someone or something different. So, to change the world, we need
   to keep walking to that sign that reads 'new visions make a new world'.

   We need to make a difference. To make a difference we need to be the
   change we would want to see. To change the world, commitments and
   dedications should take the place of hatred and miscommunications."

   "In my opinion the key to changing the world is in education," writes
   Omar.

   "I propose that we build schools in some of the poorer countries,
   teaching them basic skills to help them secure a better future. So
   instead of just teaching people academically, they should also teach
   them manual skills which will benefit them in everyday life.

   I believe there is lots of talent and ability which is hidden in third
   world countries. There might be the next Albert Einstein who might
   discover the solution to global warming."

   Ibrahim writes:"My solution to changing the world is simple; it's
   called holistic thinking. This means thinking in a system and realising
   the bigger picture. If you want to save the forest, you don't just look
   at the tree, you look at the whole forest and analyse every detail in
   the hope of fixing the bigger problem.

   The way we can get the world thinking holistically is not easy, we must
   implement it into our daily lives and this must start at school.
   Holistic thinking can save the world, it helps decision makers with
   tools that help them in arriving at the preferred decisions."

Pupils from the King Edward VI School in Northumberland Angus write about
online bullying, state education and hospital care...

   "It's not hard to hold put downs back, so why do people express them?"
   writes 14-year-old Angus. "Maybe they are insecure or they enjoy the
   short lived admiration that others give them when they throw insults.
   Or it could be that they have nothing else to say?

   Often, when people express their cruel thoughts, they aim to grab
   attention. Technology makes this easy. Social networking sites allow
   views to be shared with hundreds, even thousands of people
   instantaneously, making them a platform for the spread of hurtful
   comments.

   If only people would recognise the hurt they cause when they put others
   down. Many people suffer in silence because of hurtful comments
   directed at them. If only the bullies who inflict this kind of mental
   torture could switch places with their victims; then they would know
   how it feels. Or, they could simply think before they speak."

   Catherine, 13, writes: "I believe the school system in England is
   unfair to the lower classes. Children who can afford to go to public
   school are better supported because of the money they pay, which makes
   it hard for state schools to keep up with the grades these schools
   achieve.

   It would be better if all schools were state schools, like other
   countries in Europe, to give everyone a fair chance.

   Anyone from different backgrounds could get better jobs, and help to
   get people back into jobs. I believe everyone should be equal
   together."

   Lorena writes: "If I were to think of one thing that could change our
   world for the better, it would be to bring back the kind of nurses
   there used to be in our hospitals.

   Hospitals used to be a place for people to rest, be taken care of and
   get better. Now it's all been modified for industrial purposes; all
   about making money and not about taking care of the patients. It seems
   that now care is cut down to the absolute minimum, it's more like
   having a second doctor.

   In the long term there would be fewer patients as they would be
   properly taken care of and leave much faster, so the money that would
   have been going towards the hospital can be sent to other charities."

Colegio Certo is a school based in Teresina, in the north of Brazil, and they
are linked with Roseberry Sports and Community College in Durham in the UK.
Read Teresina pupils' letters below...

   Brazilian pupils write letters Brazilian pupils write letters

   Luana, 15, writes: "Instead of focusing on the world's big problems, we
   should focus on our own happiness. Our energy should be put into love,
   and education.

   We should fight for a new humanity, freeing man from selfishness and
   violence, improving justice and brotherhood and creating a better
   future for young people."

   Pedro writes: "I would make it so that people understand the meaning of
   the word 'believe', the force of the word 'power' and the happiness of
   the word 'achievement'.
   Brazilian pupils write letters

   When they see a picture of famine in Africa, they shouldn't feel shame
   but compassion. When they hear about war in the Middle East, they
   shouldn't accept the discord, and when they see sad things, they
   shouldn't feel despair.

   More than this, they should try to improve their own world and they
   should feel encouraged by the mission to change one stone at a time. To
   change the world, it's not necessary to hope, it's necessary to begin."

   "When we're kids, we already know the world has problems," says
   17-year-old Adriano. "But, as things are simpler when we're younger, we
   think we can change the world by rubbing a magic lamp. When we become
   teenagers, we realise that these things don't exist and the world's
   problems are a lot worse than we thought.

   It's when we reach this age that we learn more about the cause of these
   problems, and then a ray of hope appears and we realise that there are
   solutions. "

Bedford Academy in the UK is linked with Bishop Okiring secondary school in
Kenya's Mount Elgon region. Mudrik and Lauren from Bedford want everyone to
have a good education, while David looks at what can be done to help combat
climate change...

   Kenyan pupils campaign for girls' education

   Lauren writes: "In Kenya, when they arrive at school they are not
   provided with books, equipment or uniform as a lot of the students
   cannot afford them. Regardless of this they work hard and make the most
   out of what they have to gain an education in order to escape poverty.

   In the UK education is available and free to everyone. I am currently a
   sixth form student at Bedford Academy and we are about to move into a
   £22.5 million new building with the latest IT equipment and science and
   technology facilities. But many of the students here do not appreciate
   how lucky we are to have these facilities.

   After spending the last year raising awareness within my school, local
   community and government about the lack of education opportunities
   specifically for girls in third world countries such as those in
   Africa, Bangladesh and India I now consider this as something that is
   very close to my heart, and something I am passionate about changing.

   Education is the best way to protect young girls from the dangers such
   as forced marriages which can take place at the young age of 12 and the
   dangers of HIV. This is done by giving them the chance to achieve their
   dreams of an easier and safer life through education."

   Mudrik writes: "I believe that to beat poverty we need to educate
   people and show them how they can manage and sustain their lives. No
   country has succeeded if it has not educated its people. Not only is
   education important in reducing poverty, it is also a key to wealth
   creation...

   If developing countries can offer good quality education to kids, the
   results will be tremendous. Education is considered a 'vaccine' for
   HIV/AIDS - if children are educated about the disease, they are much
   less likely to contract the disease. Literacy helps communication and
   reasoning skills in children. And most importantly, education can help
   children from poor families break out of poverty.

   If these schools had more access to computers and the internet, then
   they would have a wealth of information at their fingertips. Can you
   imagine the impact of having the ability to teach more third world
   youths the skills needed to become a teacher, a philosopher or even a
   doctor? They could even know the ideas behind freedom and democracy?
   The impact would be huge!"

   David writes: "The effects of climate change can already be seen, but
   the worst is yet to come with scientists predicting a future average
   temperature rise of up to 6.4°C by the end of this century. The effects
   of a rise in temperature this high could be devastating... making many
   refugees of the earth. With wider spread drought and flooding it will
   become harder to sustain the world's food sources....

   Animal agriculture accounts for 18% of all our greenhouse gas
   emissions, when we compare this to the transport systems comparatively
   small contribution of 14% we see just how great of an impact the animal
   agriculture industry has.

   If everyone became a vegan, 10 billion people could be fed on the land
   vacated by animals that are reared for meat, meaning there could
   potentially be no more large scale famine if everyone adopted this
   simple change.

   This is why I don't eat meat and why I am in the transition of becoming
   Vegan. This is because it's bad for the environment, because if we
   didn't waste all of our crop growing meat, no one would have to go
   hungry, and so long as we use animals for our personal gain, they will
   continue to suffer."

Beit Hanoun Preparatory School in the Gaza Strip is twinned with Northwood
Primary in the UK. Pupils Tarik and Liath have written about about peace and
equality...

   Liath writes: "Hi there, It's me, Liath, from Palestine. I would like
   to thank you because you have given me this chance to write and talk.

   What I want from this world is the end of wars and problems, and I want
   to live in peace and safety wherever I go. Also, I want this world to
   be open to all the places and we can travel without any obstacles.

   Moreover, I want this world to be equal. After I have seen the pictures
   of the students in London when our teacher visited Northwood school,
   and how the children enjoy their times, I dream of things like the
   things they have for me and for all children living in developing
   countries.

   So, I want every child to be treated the same. We want to play computer
   games, sports, go to different places and have a better education."

   Tariq writes: "I am Palestinian and I live in Gaza Strip.

   I love my country and I like all the people in this world. I love my
   planet, the Earth. I hope in the future for all people on the Earth to
   be united and love each other and made our planet without wars and
   pollution.

   I hope that peace cover all over the world and our planet to be safe
   from wars, crimes and accidents and people don't hate each other.

   I dislike people who don't respect other people in our world and cause
   suffering for more other people in the world.

   I like to live in peace and love and I wish this to be spread between
   people all the time.

   I hope all people to enjoy good health, peace and love all over the
   world."

Northwood Primary in the UK is twinned with Beit Hanoun Preparatory School in
the Gaza Strip. Pupils have written how they think everyone is entitled to a
safe place to live and a good education...

   Olamide and Gwen, both 9, write: "We strongly believe that everyone has
   a right to a safe house to live in and 100% of our class think it's
   terrible to live outside where shelters are usually dirty, small areas.

   Everyone has a right to a house to live in and we have a solution to
   the problem of people being homeless. We can find homeless people and
   ask them if they know where any of their relatives live. We want to go
   to the relative's house and ask them if the homeless person can live
   with them."

   Karen and Olumide write: "We realise how lucky we are to go to school.
   Children in poor places like Afghanistan and Gaza often don't have the
   opportunity to get a good education. Because of this they can't get a
   good job, and if they don't get a good job they don't have a chance of
   earning good money.

   Millions of people in the world don't get a good education and without
   this they may end up living on the streets because they can't earn
   enough money to pay their bills."

Kenyan pupils from Bishop Okiring school in Mount Elgon, which is twinned
with Bedford Academy. Senior pupils have written about their struggle to get
an education...

   Alex outside the school Alex outside the school

   Alex Chebasis, age 21, writes: "As a student I face numerous
   challenges. I am disabled. I was attacked by polio at a young age which
   paralysed my hand and leg.

   This makes my movement and working very difficult since the facilities
   we have do not provide for the disabled.

   Our school has many shortcomings which need to be addressed: a library
   to improve reading culture, a school bus to assist in movement of
   students to different areas.

   The school and community need a medical facility to reduce cases of
   polio and other diseases.

   Even with these challenges I am facing as a student, I am determined to
   complete my education and become a lawyer."

   Eglah, age 18, writes: "I wish to be a banker upon completing my
   education. I come from a very poor family.

   Girls in Mount Elgon do not go far in education since the society does
   not support girls education [for secondary education]. They pay fees
   for boys but rarely do they pay for girls.

   If school fees for girls is paid then more will go to school."

   Isaac, age 21, writes: "Education has helped in moulding my character
   and getting knowledge.

   My dream is to become an engineer. However I am facing many challenges
   as a student and member of the community.

   First my parents are poor and unable to raise school fees and other
   basic items. The only meal I eat is lunch given by the school. The hut
   I sleep in is almost collapsing yet my parents can't do any repairs.

   Our community needs a source of clean water, health centre and school
   bus for Bishop Okiring."

   Rebbecca, age 17, writes: "My vision is to become a lawyer who
   advocates for girl education and generally for the rights of the girl
   child.

   In my society girls face numerous hurdles as they try to get education.
   These include female genital mutilation (FGM), early marriages, early
   pregnancies, forced marriages, HIV and Aids pandemic, cultural
   stereotypes where parents educate boys at the expense of girls, child
   labour, [and] girls do a lot of domestic work.

   The community needs a school that gives a very special attention to
   girl education."

Park House Academy in Newbury, UK is twinned with School 79 in Mongolia.
Pupils there have come up with ideas to make a difference. Meet the hologram
teacher and a new ministry, the Department of Common Sense...

   Pupils write letters

   Imogen and Kate write: "Dear World, To change the world we would like
   to encourage learning in less developed countries.

   We believe that there is a lack of qualified teachers in developing
   countries, however there is a demanding need for better education in
   economically advancing countries.

   Our idea is to produce a portable system - similar to over-head
   projectors used currently in Britain - to generate holograms of
   qualified teachers for transportation to countries without the
   facilities capable of schooling.

   The programme would consist of a series of discs, each containing five
   hours of learning, for five days a week, including holidays. The system
   will be easily operated... The hologram-projector will be solar powered
   to ensure a long lifespan.

   One of the most prominent courses would be health and survival,
   educating children with basic life skills.

   This would provide young, deprived people with a range of available
   qualifications to give them more job opportunities all over the world,
   and allow them to escape poverty."

   Gareth & Marcus write: "Common sense is the basis for all intelligence;
   the basis for all humanity and its advancement and evolution. History,
   however, teaches us that the human race is somewhat lacking in this
   aspect. For what other species... is seemingly obsessed with destroying
   itself in every way possible?

   A solution, then? The first step would be to educate people in common
   sense. This would take the form of a subject taught in schools, perhaps
   using historical examples and a set of 'guidelines', almost, to making
   a decision.

   A further step would be to make it obligatory for any organisation,
   including governments, to have a 'Department of Common Sense', which
   would ultimately be responsible for allowing or vetoing any decision
   made, based on its logic.

   Imagine a world where the politicians with the ability to start war
   possessed the common sense to choose instead to spend the time and
   money on developing medical research.

   People would come out of a sophisticated education with the ability to
   make rational decisions in life."

   Penny, Emma, Karolina and Josh write: "Hey World, You still friends
   with the moon? I hope so. Anyway, we have come up with a genius plan...

   People who buy petrol are already paying expensive petrol prices.

   Therefore, if we charge them just £1 a month to buy a petrol pass, when
   the pass has expired after a month it must be renewed as those without
   a pass cannot buy petrol.

   The card will track petrol consumption rates and monthly expenditure
   enabling the user to monitor it. When people realise how much petrol
   they are using it will be simple to avoid unnecessary usage therefore
   saving themselves money and cutting down greenhouse gas emissions.

   So World, what do you think then? Earning three gigabazzillion dollars
   without people noticing and cutting down on greenhouse gasses seems a
   pretty good idea...."
