   AUSTIN, Texas--Soon after Texas Republicans notched another round of
   lopsided wins last November, the state GOP sent notice to its local
   chapters: Please stop holding party meetings in country clubs.

   Steve Munisteri, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas.

[122]Join the Conversation: What's the Future of the GOP?

   After last year's stinging election losses, the Republican Party
   [123]is at a crossroads . We invite readers to weigh in as The Wall
   Street Journal runs a series of articles examining the future of the
   GOP. [124]Click here to see what other readers have to say, or share

   Other advice followed. Please consider hosting Republican recruiting
   tables at naturalization ceremonies. Word spread among state GOP
   lawmakers to back off on bills targeting illegal immigrants in the
   legislative session.

   In no state is the Republican grip at once so firm, and under such
   challenge from Democrats, as it is in Texas. And nowhere is that grip
   of more consequence to the fortunes of the national GOP.

   Republicans have won all of Texas' 29 statewide offices since 1994, the
   longest streak of single-party dominance in the country. Republican
   Rick Perry is the state's longest-serving governor. GOP presidential
   nominee Mitt Romney took Texas in a walk last year, beating [129]Barack
   Obama by a margin four percentage points wider than Sen. John McCain
   did in 2008.

   But Republicans here are suddenly looking over their shoulder, worried
   that demographic shifts and a big push by Democrats to capitalize could
   soon turn the state into the ultimate battleground between the two
   parties. One of the most important backroom players in President
   Obama's 2012 campaign has launched a broad effort to pull the state
   into the Democratic column.

   No one questions the enormity of the stakes. If the country's
   second-largest state turns blue--a possibility Democrats say is at most
   a decade away--Republicans could find their most viable path to the
   White House blocked.

   Some Republicans scoff at the thought of Texas ever tipping back to the
   Democrats. Gov. Perry, in a recent interview, dismissed the idea as "a
   pipe dream" more far-fetched than the University of Texas adopting the
   colors of archrival Texas A&M.

   "We are not despairing. Far from it," said Steve Munisteri, the feisty
   chairman of the Texas GOP, who is girding for the fight ahead. "But nor
   are we taking anything for granted." Among other things, Republicans
   say that many Hispanics are drawn to the party's more-conservative
   social stands.

   Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk says he supports same-sex marriage and that
   "government has no place in the middle," becoming the second Republican
   senator to do so. Neil King looks at the tug-of-war over gay marriage
   in the Republican Party.

   Other party leaders are more cautious. "To call the last national
   election anything but a wake-up call would be remiss," said Carolyn
   Hodges, president of the Texas Federation of Republican Women, which
   has 163 chapters and more than 11,000 members. "If we Republicans don't
   find a way to remake and repackage ourselves, this state could go from
   being bright red to blue really fast."

   As both parties dig in, neither side disputes the basic facts.

   Texas is one of just four states--California, New Mexico and Hawaii are
   the others--where non-Hispanic whites, at 45%, are in the minority.
   Hispanics, who went heavily Democratic in the 2012 national vote, now
   represent 38% of the Texas population. By 2016, nearly a million more
   Hispanics will be eligible to vote in Texas, more than quadruple the
   number of eligible new Anglo voters, according to several forecasts.
   Other new residents continue to pour in from an array of traditionally
   Democratic states, particularly California.

   Meanwhile, Texas has some of the country's lowest voter-participation
   rates, especially among groups that typically skew Democratic, That
   leads some Democrats to compare the state to a vast oil field that has
   yet to be tapped. The state has 13.6 million registered voters. But
   Democrats say there are nearly three million eligible but unregistered
   Hispanics and African Americans, and at least half that many who are
   registered but don't vote.

   Mr. Romney won Texas by a margin of 1.2 million votes in November.

   Republicans' desire to shore up their standing with this growing
   Hispanic bloc has some in the party scrambling to change their
   immigration stance.

   The state party dramatically changed its official platform last year,
   eliminating references to mass deportations and calling for a
   guest-worker program. In January, the Texas Federation of Republican
   Women went further, voting to support a federal path to citizenship for
   millions of immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

   But both of the state's Republican senators, including the party's own
   top Hispanic lawmaker, Sen. Ted Cruz, oppose opening a route to
   citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally.

   Sensing opportunity, a band of former top Obama campaign operatives
   have just launched the most ambitious effort to date to loosen the GOP
   grip. Their goal: Make Texas competitive by the second half of the
   decade and eventually tip it for a Democratic presidential candidate
   for the first time since Jimmy Carter won here in 1976.

   Led by former Obama field director Jeremy Bird, the Battleground Texas
   project plans to marshal much the same manpower and data-mining the
   Obama campaign used to swing states such as Colorado and Virginia in
   the past two elections.

   Wiry and bespectacled, Mr. Bird likes to describe how the past two
   Obama campaigns were littered with foot soldiers from Texas laboring in
   other states. Texas volunteers made more than 400,000 calls into
   Florida in the final weeks of the 2012 campaign, he said.

   "For years you have been giving to the national campaign," he told a
   packed ballroom of 300 or so Texas Democratic volunteers in San Antonio
   recently on his first public swing through the state. "Now it's time
   the national campaign gave back to you."

   Mr. Bird and other Democrats say Texas, because its vote has been so
   one-sided in national elections, has been all but untouched by the
   precinct-by-precinct arts of modern voter mobilization. "Texans haven't
   seen a presidential TV ad on anything but cable since Jimmy Carter,"
   said Mr. Bird. "That should tell you something."

   Democrats point to a little-noted mobilization drive called the 21
   Precinct Project that the Travis County Democratic Party ran in the
   largely Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods of East Austin.

   In the fall of 2010, the party combed through data to identify 23,452
   households where residents were registered, and likely to be Democrats,
   but rarely voted. A team of 41 volunteers and paid staff then spent
   five weeks calling and visiting those homes, urging them to vote. The
   project cost a little over $40,000.

   The results were startling: a 54% jump in straight-ticket Democratic
   voting, and a turnout rate nearly 20% higher than the rest of Travis
   County.

   The conclusion, according to county Democratic chairman Andy Brown, who
   ran the drive: "People respond if you ask for their vote. And in Texas,
   millions of people have never been asked."

   Austin resident Santos Martinez is one recent convert to the voting
   process. Born in Laredo, Texas, 46 years ago, Mr. Martinez says he
   "never really paid attention to voting, never really cared about it." A
   community activist group convinced him to register and cast his first
   vote last year, which he did, for President Obama and every other
   Democrat on the ticket.

   "Now I tell my son, 'Don't wait like me,' " said Mr. Martinez, who
   works as a maintenance man. "'When you get the chance, vote.'"

   Over lunch at a packed restaurant south of downtown San Antonio, Mayor
   Julián Castro beams at the Democrats' chances in the years ahead. After
   giving the keynote address at the Democratic Party convention in
   September, Mr. Castro dropped into Virginia, Florida and Nevada as a
   campaign surrogate for President Obama. What he saw stunned him.

   "The sheer intensity of the campaigning there, the all-out effort to
   find and mobilize votes, was unlike anything I have ever seen in
   Texas," he said.

   Mr. Castro contends the Republican room for growth in Texas is minimal.
   "But we Democrats," he said, "we haven't even begun to pick the
   low-hanging fruit."

   He and his twin brother, Joaquin, now a freshman member of Congress,
   are themselves barometers of the shift under way in Texas. Few expect
   Texas to become truly competitive for Democrats by 2014 or even 2016.
   The dream among liberals is that both Castro brothers would run in
   2018: one for governor and the other for the Senate seat now held by
   Sen. Cruz.

   Mayor Castro, at 38, says he has no plans for now to seek higher
   office, but he agrees with the time frame. "Texas," he said, "will be
   competitive in six to eight years."

   Republican Gov. Perry's pollster, Mike Baselice, has a different view.
   Hispanic support for Republican statewide candidates, he says, has
   hovered around 35% for years--higher than the 27% Mr. Romney got
   nationally last year. If the GOP can sustain that, he argues, its hold
   on the state should remain firm until early in the next decade.

   Still, the party establishment isn't taking things for granted. At
   Republican headquarters two blocks from the state Capitol, Mr.
   Munisteri, the Republican chairman, keeps an 8-inch-thick binder on his
   desk stuffed with polling data on Hispanic attitudes toward his party.
   The poll, conducted in December, was the first of its kind ever
   commissioned by the state GOP.

   Some of the poll's findings--that Hispanics largely see the GOP as the
   party of the rich bent on eliminating the social safety net--underscore
   the Republican challenge.

   But Mr. Munisteri hammers on the positive: how 40% of Texas Hispanics
   call themselves conservatives, and how Mr. Romney in November got more
   than 35% of the state Hispanic vote last year, in contrast to Mr.
   Romney's tepid performance nationally.

   Other statewide Republican candidates, the poll found, outpaced Mr.
   Romney by claiming closer to 40% of the Hispanic vote. "If we can
   maintain levels like that, we can win elections here until I die," Mr.
   Munisteri said.

   Joe Gomez, a 49-year-old businessman and lifelong Republican in San
   Antonio, is eager to see his party change and diversify, both in its
   candidates and its voter base. "We need to change the entire image of
   who a Republican voter is," he said. "If we don't, the party is heading
   for disaster and will eventually die."

   Several groups have sprung up to recruit and fund conservative Hispanic
   candidates, including one founded in 2010 by George P. Bush, the son of
   former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and nephew of former President George W.
   Bush. The younger Bush, whose mother was born in Mexico, recently
   announced plans to run for Texas land commissioner next year, his first
   foray into elected office.

   His group, Hispanic Republicans of Texas, spent around $300,000 on
   training and supporting local Latino candidates last year, a sum the
   group expects will more than double going into the 2014 election.

   At the same time, the state party began a drive last year to recruit
   hundreds of new Hispanic GOP party delegates to the party by calling
   all Hispanic-surnamed residents who voted in the last Republican
   primary.

   David Zapata, the 30-year-old son of Mexican immigrants who runs the
   party's Latino outreach, said it isn't enough to win voters.

   "Voters are great, but we need active participants," he said. "We need
   new people, new faces, who will be a permanent part of the party."

   The GOP's most palpable shift has come on the immigration front.
   Republican lawmakers introduced over 100 immigration-related bills in
   the past legislative session, including measures to deny cheaper
   in-state college tuition to the children of illegal immigrants and to
   overturn laws in several Texas cities that offered refuge to
   undocumented workers.

   This session, with the filing deadline now past, fewer than five such
   bills have been put forward.

   "Let's just say we are taking a different tone this year," said
   Republican state Rep. Larry Gonzalez, who represents a district just
   north of Austin. "We're focusing on things we can control, like jobs,
   education and water."

   Both parties are now rolling out the full martial lexicon as they brace
   for the fight ahead. Mr. Bird says his Battleground Texas project will
   spend tens of millions of dollars to wage a statewide Democratic voter
   mobilization drive that will focus first on the most promising counties
   and work out from there.

   Speaking of the Republicans, Mr. Bird said with a grin: "If I were
   them, I would be scared."

   From GOP headquarters, Mr. Munisteri said he has heard big talk from
   the Democrats before. "But if they do roll out the big guns, we won't
   stand by," he said, "All artillery fire will be responded to in kind."
