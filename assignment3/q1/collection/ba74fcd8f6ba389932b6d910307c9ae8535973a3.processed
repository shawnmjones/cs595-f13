Pennsylvania Step May Help Republicans Win Electoral Vote

   By Romy Varghese - 2012-12-03T21:36:32Z

   A Pennsylvania lawmaker's plan to divvy up electoral votes based on a
   presidential candidate's public support may be just the first of many
   state legislative moves to alter the way the nation chooses a leader.

   State Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi, a Republican from
   Chester, wants to replace the winner-take-all system, which gave
   President [57]Barack Obama Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes, with one
   that divides them to reflect the proportion of public support for each
   candidate. His method would have given 12 votes to Obama and eight to
   Republican [58]Mitt Romney this year.

   "Anyone who voted for [59]Governor Romney, and many Pennsylvanians did,
   does not have any reflection of that vote in the electoral college
   vote," Pileggi said. "This is a proposal that is not party specific or
   partisan in any way, but just an attempt to have the popular vote
   reflected in the electoral college vote."

   Pileggi's proposal, which he asked senators in a memo to cosponsor, may
   be the first of a spate presented to lawmakers nationwide. Daniel P.
   Tokaji, a law professor at [60]Ohio State University in Columbus and
   associate director of its [61]Election Law @ Moritz center said he
   wouldn't be surprised to see Republicans and Democrats seeking ways to
   "game the system" ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

Narrower Margin

   If all states had used Pileggi's method, the final outcome Nov. 6
   wouldn't have changed, though it would've narrowed Obama's margin of
   victory, according a preliminary legislative analysis of the proposal.
   The president would've won 281 electoral votes to Romney's 256. Obama
   won, 332 to 206.

   Next year, at least 36 states will have one-party [62]control of
   legislatures and governor's offices, including Pennsylvania, according
   to MultiStates Associates Inc., a lobbying firm in Alexandria,
   [63]Virginia.

   "It's never too early for partisan gamesmanship among partisan
   politicians," Tokaji said.

   Pileggi plans to introduce the bill next month. Last year he pushed a
   bill to carve up electoral votes based on results from congressional
   districts, to no avail.

   Adopting a proportional method of allocation would lessen
   [64]Pennsylvania's importance as a swing state in national politics,
   Tokaji said. While Republicans control the Legislature and the
   governor's office, voters have backed Democrats for president since
   1992.

Partisan Motive

   "Why would Pennsylvanians want to dilute their own state's influence?"
   Tokaji said. "It doesn't make any sense unless their goal is to advance
   the Republicans' chance to win the White House. The motivation behind
   it is entirely partisan."

   Pileggi said he didn't know how the state could have less importance,
   given the "very little campaigning" by Obama and Romney there. "The
   point is not what party is advantaged," he said. "The point is, how do
   you best reflect the wishes of the citizens of Pennsylvania. And it's
   not best done by the current winner-take-all system."

   [65]Michigan, [66]South Carolina and Virginia also had bills pending in
   2011 and this year that would have altered their ways of tallying the
   votes, by allocating them based on congressional districts, according
   to Wendy Underhill, a policy specialist at the [67]National Conference
   of State Legislatures.

Maine, Nebraska

   U.S. states cast [68]Electoral College votes based on the size of their
   congressional delegations, with 270 required to win the presidency.
   Only two -- Maine and [69]Nebraska -- don't use a winner-take-all
   system favoring the candidate with the most popular support. The method
   was set up as a compromise between having Congress elect the nation's
   leader and letting citizens make the choice directly.

   Maine and Nebraska award their electoral votes partly based on results
   in each congressional district. Pileggi, backed by Republican Governor
   Tom Corbett, first proposed shifting to a district-based system in
   September 2011. His [70]bill met with criticism from Democrats, who
   said it aimed to boost the Republican candidate's chances, and it never
   reached the floor.

   A Corbett spokesman, [71]Kevin Harley, said the governor hasn't seen
   Pileggi's proposal yet and had no comment on it.

   Under the lawmaker's proportional plan, two electoral votes would go to
   the statewide winner. The remaining 18 would be parceled out based on
   the percentage of the popular vote cast for each candidate. Since Obama
   [72]won 52 percent Nov. 6, he would have gotten 52 percent of 18,
   rounded up to 10, plus the two awarded to the state victor.

   If Pileggi's plan passes, Pennsylvania would be the only state to use
   such a formula, according to the council of legislatures. None
   considered such an approach in legislative sessions this year or last,
   Underhill said.

   The Keystone State did make a significant change in its election law
   this year, passing a measure requiring people to present photo
   identification to vote. The provision was suspended for Nov. 6 and
   faces a legal challenge from the [73]American Civil Liberties Union,
   which claims the law unfairly burdens minorities, the elderly and the
   poor.
