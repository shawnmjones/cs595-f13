President Obama asks Congress to delay Syria strike vote

   By Michael Pearson and Steve Almasy, CNN
   updated 9:57 PM EDT, Tue September 10, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: President says he will continue talks with Russia's president,
       while keeping military ready
     * NEW: Obama says he is sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet
       with Russian foreign minister
     * Syria will sign on to chemical weapons accord, Foreign Minister
       Walid Moallem says
     * Syria also prepared to disclose chemical weapons, discontinue
       production, he says

   (CNN) -- As a Russian proposal to strip Syria of its chemical weapons
   began to take shape, the White House eased off the gas on Tuesday in
   its drive for congressional approval to strike the Middle Eastern
   country.

   President Barack Obama asked congressional leaders to delay votes on
   authorizing military action in Syria while the diplomatic process works
   itself out, the president announced in a prime-time speech to
   Americans.

   Obama said he will continue talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin
   and will send Secretary of State John Kerry to meet with his Russian
   counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in Geneva,
   Switzerland, on Thursday.

   The United States will also give U.N. inspectors the opportunity to
   report their findings about the suspected chemical attack that occurred
   August 21, the president said.

   "Meanwhile, I've ordered our military to maintain their current posture
   to keep the pressure on (Syrian President Bashar al-)Assad and to be in
   a position to respond if diplomacy fails," Obama said in his 16-minute
   address.

   Earlier, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on the Senate
   floor that he had canceled a briefing for all senators scheduled for
   Wednesday.

   He said the Senate schedule was driven by developments and not by an
   artificial timeline.

   "It's important that we do this well, not quickly," he said. "We'll see
   what's going on. You know, the last 24 hours has had some remarkable
   changes in what people are talking about. Let's see what else happens."

   [41]Keeping up with the latest key developments

   Important meeting in Geneva

   Kerry will bring a team of experts with him Thursday for the talks with
   Lavrov, according to senior State Department officials. Another U.S.
   official told CNN the Department of Defense will be sending experts in
   chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction.

   The discussions are expected to take place in several sessions over two
   days, but negotiations may not be concluded in Geneva, the officials
   cautioned.

   The officials said a final deal -- whenever it is reached -- would be
   taken to the United Nations and presented in a Security Council
   resolution.

   Russia calls off Security Council session

   Moscow withdrew its request for an emergency United Nations Security
   Council meeting on the Syrian crisis that had been set for Tuesday, a
   U.N. diplomat said.

   Russia -- which has been a key player in efforts to have Syria give up
   its chemical weapons -- dropped its request due to "changing
   circumstances," according to the diplomat.

   Obama: Assad's threats not credible

   Syria is willing to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, Foreign
   Minister Walid Moallem said before departing Moscow.

   "We are ready to fully cooperate in realizing the initiative," he told
   reporters, according to a CNN translation.

   Earlier Tuesday, Russia's Foreign Ministry said it deemed as
   "unacceptable" a French proposal -- also backed by some U.S. lawmakers
   -- asking the Security Council to declare Syria responsible for the
   August 21 chemical attack that U.S. officials say killed more than
   1,400 people.

   According to Syrian state TV, Syria on Tuesday accepted Russia's
   proposal to put its chemical weapons under international control a day
   after Kerry floated the idea in what appeared to be an off-the-cuff
   comment suggesting it would be the only way for Syria to avoid a
   punishing Western military strike.

   Moallem said the country was ready to disclose the location of its
   chemical weapons, halt production and show facilities to
   representatives of Russia, the United Nations and other states.

   [42]Syria's chemical arsenal at a glance

   Syria is a longtime Russian ally, and Russian officials have argued, as
   have Syrian officials, that rebel forces could have staged the attack.

   Growing support

   Moallem said Tuesday that his country had agreed to the Russian
   proposal after what the Russian new agency Interfax quoted him as
   calling "a very fruitful round of talks" with his Russian counterpart,
   Lavrov, on Monday.

   Despite the lack of details, the idea was gaining traction around the
   world.

   On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed support for the
   concept. Tuesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said it would
   safeguard stability in the region. Syrian ally Iran welcomed the
   proposal, and Germany expressed interest.

   French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France will not accept
   delays in the transfer.

   "We need quick results," Fabius said.

   European Union Foreign Affairs Secretary Catherine Ashton said she
   supported the French plan to bring the issue to the Security Council,
   saying the proposal "now needs to be fully worked up as quickly as
   possible."

   Even Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, a proponent of a military strike on
   Syria and robust aid to the rebels, said the idea was worth exploring.

   "I'm very, very skeptical," he said on CNN's "New Day." "But the fact
   is, you can't pass up this opportunity -- if it is one."

   [43]CNN Poll: Syria strike

   Inauspicious beginning

   The Russian proposal surfaced publicly on Monday, when Kerry --
   responding to a reporter asking what Syria could do to stop a U.S.
   attack -- suggested that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad "could turn
   over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international
   community in the next week."

   "He isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously," Kerry
   added.

   His spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, sought to roll back the comments, saying
   the secretary was simply responding to a "hypothetical."

   But it turns out Putin brought the idea up to Obama last week, a senior
   administration official said Monday night.

   Kerry and Lavrov have also been discussing ways for Moscow to get
   involved for more than a year, the official said. But U.S. officials
   didn't realize how serious Russia was until Lavrov seized on Kerry's
   comment on Monday, the official said.
