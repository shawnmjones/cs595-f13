   "Seriously, Justice Kennedy? Are you for real?"

     Today's judgment will, to be sure, have the beneficial effect of
     solving more crimes; then again, so would the taking of DNA samples
     from anyone who flies on an airplane (surely the Transportation
     Security Administration needs to know the "identity" of the flying
     public), applies for a driver's license, or attends a public school.
     Perhaps the construction of such a genetic panopticon is wise. But
     I doubt that the proud men who wrote the charter of our liberties
     would have been so eager to open their mouths for royal inspection.

     --Justice Antonin Scalia, Maryland v King (dissenting)

   We first discussed the case of Maryland v. Alonzo Jay King (because all
   criminals use their middle names) [30]when it was before the Supreme
   Court of the United States in February. King had been arrested in
   April, 2009 for first-degree assault and under Maryland law the police
   were entitled to have a DNA sample taken from him (cheek swab), which
   in turn linked him to an unsolved 2003 rape/robbery case. King moved to
   suppress the evidence and the Maryland Court of Appeals agreed, saying
   that the DNA collection went beyond law enforcement's legitimate needs
   as to the crime for which King was arrested.

   [31]In a 5-4 decision announced today, the Supreme Court of the United
   States reversed, holding that the Fourth Amendment allows the police,
   without first obtaining a warrant, to obtain DNA from any person
   arrested for [32]a "serious" crime--crimes of violence, basically. And
   it's not the five you expected. For those of you [33]who like Angry
   Scalia when [34]he's on your side of an argument, flip below the fold
   for Vintage Nino, because he is not in a good mood.

   Justice Kennedy writing for the majority in approving of this DNA
   collection scheme, consisting of himself, the Chief Justice, and
   Justices Thomas, Breyer, and Alito, emphasized how reasonable it was
   for police to have the best information available about who had been
   arrested:

     The legitimate government interest served by the Maryland DNA
     Collection Act is one that is well established: the need for law
     enforcement officers in a safe and accurate way to process and
     identify the persons and possessions they must take into custody.
     ...When probable cause exists to remove an individual from the
     normal channels of society and hold him in legal custody, DNA
     identification plays a critical role in serving those interests.

     First, "[i]n every criminal case, it is known and must be known who
     has been arrested and who is being tried." An individual's identity
     is more than just his name or Social Security number, and the
     government's interest in identification goes beyond ensuring that
     the proper name is typed on the indictment. Identity has never been
     considered limited to the name on the arrestee's birth certificate.
     In fact, a name is of little value compared to the real interest in
     identification at stake when an individual is brought into custody.
     "It is a well recognized aspect of criminal conduct that the
     per-petrator will take unusual steps to conceal not only his
     conduct, but also his identity. Disguises used while committing a
     crime may be supplemented or replaced by changed names, and even
     changed physical features." An "arrestee may be carrying a false ID
     or lie about his identity," and "criminal history records . . . can
     be inaccurate or incomplete."

     A suspect's criminal history is a critical part of his identity that
     officers should know when processing him for detention. It is a
     common occurrence that "[p]eople detained for minor offenses can
     turn out to be the most devious and dangerous criminals. Hours after
     the Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh was stopped by a state
     trooper who noticed he was driving without a license plate. Police
     stopped serial killer Joel Rifkin for the same reason. One of the
     terrorists involved in the September 11 attacks was stopped and
     ticketed for speeding just two days before hijacking Flight 93."
     Police already seek this crucial identifying information. They use
     routine and accepted means as varied as comparing the suspect's
     booking photograph to sketch artists' depictions of persons of
     interest, showing his mugshot to potential witnesses, and of course
     making a computerized comparison of the arrestee's fingerprints
     against electronic databases of known criminals and unsolved crimes.
     In this respect the only difference between DNA analysis and the
     accepted use of fingerprint databases is the unparalleled accuracy
     DNA provides....  [T]he use of DNA for identification is no
     different than matching an arrestee's face to a wanted poster of a
     previously unidentified suspect; or matching tattoos to known gang
     symbols to reveal a criminal affiliation; or matching the arrestee's
     fingerprints to those recovered from a crime scene.

   Also, Kennedy argues, this helps in determining who should be released
   on bail:

     In considering laws to require collecting DNA from arrestees,
     government agencies around the Nation found evidence of numerous
     cases in which felony arrestees would have been identified as
     violent through DNA identification matching them to previous crimes
     but who later committed additional crimes because such
     identification was not used to detain them. ...

     Present capabilities make it possible to complete a DNA
     identification that provides information essential to determining
     whether a detained suspect can be released pending trial. See, e.g.,
     States Brief 18, n. 10 ("DNA identification database samples have
     been processed in as few as two days in California, although around
     30 days has been average"). Regardless of when the initial bail
     decision is made, release is not appropriate until a further
     determination is made as to the person's identity in the sense not
     only of what his birth certificate states but also what other
     records and data disclose to give that identity more meaning in the
     whole context of who the person really is. And even when release is
     permitted, the background identity of the suspect is necessary for
     determining what conditions must be met before release is allowed.

   Also, BTW, your DNA can help some innocent dude go free, and isn't that
   great?

     [I]n the interests of justice, the identification of an arrestee as
     the perpetrator of some heinous crime may have the salutary effect
     of freeing a person wrongfully imprisoned for the same offense.
     "[P]rompt [DNA] testing . . . would speed up apprehension of
     criminals before they commit additional crimes, and prevent the
     grotesque detention of . . . innocent people." J. Dwyer, P. Neufeld,
     & B. Scheck, Actual Innocence 245 (2000).

   And, hey: it's totally not intrusive, because once you've been arrested
   you really have no rights anyway:

     The expectations of privacy of an individual taken into police
     custody "necessarily [are] of a diminished scope." "[B]oth the
     person and the property in his immediate possession may be searched
     at the station house."  A search of the detainee's person when he is
     booked into custody may " `involve a relatively extensive
     exploration,' " including [35]"requir[ing] at least some detainees
     to lift their genitals or cough in a squatting position."

     ....Here, by contrast to the approved standard procedures incident
     to any arrest detailed above, a buccal swab involves an even more
     brief and still minimal intrusion. A gentle rub along the inside of
     the cheek does not break the skin, and it "involves virtually no
     risk, trauma, or pain."

   So, for those five, this is totally innocent, awesome, non-intrusive,
   and peachy-keen, and only affects Bad People anyway.

   Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and
   Justice Kagan join, dissented from this conclusion. And how:

     The Fourth Amendment forbids searching a person for evidence of a
     crime when there is no basis for believing the person is guilty of
     the crime or is in possession of incriminating evidence. That
     prohibition is categorical and without exception; it lies at the
     very heart of the Fourth Amendment. Whenever this Court has allowed
     a suspicionless search, it has insisted upon a justifying motive
     apart from the investigation of crime.

     It is obvious that no such noninvestigative motive exists in this
     case. The Court's assertion that DNA is being taken, not to solve
     crimes, but to identify those in the State's custody, taxes the
     credulity of the credulous. And the Court's comparison of Maryland's
     DNA searches to other techniques, such as fingerprinting, can seem
     apt only to those who know no more than today's opinion has chosen
     to tell them about how those DNA searches actually work.

   He's just getting started:

     At any rate, all this discussion is beside the point. No matter the
     degree of invasiveness, suspicionless searches are never allowed if
     their principal end is ordinary crime-solving. A search incident to
     arrest either serves other ends (such as officer safety, in a search
     for weapons) or is not suspicionless (as when there is reason to
     believe the arrestee possesses evidence relevant to the crime of
     arrest).

     Sensing (correctly) that it needs more, the Court elaborates at
     length the ways that the search here served the special purpose of
     "identifying" King. But that seems to me quite wrong--unless what
     one means by "identifying" someone is "searching for evidence that
     he has committed crimes unrelated to the crime of his arrest." At
     points the Court does appear to use "identifying" in that peculiar
     sense--claiming, for example, that knowing "an arrestee's past
     conduct is essential to an assessment of the danger he poses." If
     identifying someone means finding out what unsolved crimes he has
     committed, then identification is indistinguishable from the
     ordinary law-enforcement aims that have never been thought to
     justify a suspicionless search. Searching every lawfully stopped
     car, for example, might turn up information about unsolved crimes
     the driver had committed, but no one would say that such a search
     was aimed at "identifying" him, and no court would hold such a
     search lawful. I will therefore assume that the Court means that the
     DNA search at issue here was useful to "identify" King in the normal
     sense of that word--in the sense that would identify the author of
     Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation as Jeremy
     Bentham.

   Justice Scalia proceeds to call bullshit on more of the majority's
   reasoning:

     The portion of the Court's opinion that explains the identification
     rationale is strangely silent on the actual workings of the DNA
     search at issue here. To know those facts is to be instantly
     disabused of the notion that what happened had anything to do with
     identifying King.

     King was arrested on April 10, 2009, on charges unrelated to the
     case before us. That same day, April 10, the police searched him and
     seized the DNA evidence at issue here. What happened next? Reading
     the Court's opinion, particularly its insistence that the search was
     necessary to know "who [had] been arrested," one might guess that
     King's DNA was swiftly processed and his identity thereby
     confirmed--perhaps against some master database of known DNA
     profiles, as is done for fingerprints. After all, was not the
     suspicionless search here crucial to avoid "inordinate risks for
     facility staff" or to "existing detainee population"? Surely,
     then--surely--the State of Maryland got cracking on those grave
     risks immediately, by rushing to identify King with his DNA as soon
     as possible.

     Nothing could be further from the truth. Maryland officials did not
     even begin the process of testing King's DNA that day. Or, actually,
     the next day. Or the day after that. And that was for a simple
     reason: Maryland law forbids them to do so. A "DNA sample collected
     from an individual charged with a crime . . . may not be tested or
     placed in the statewide DNA data base system prior to the first
     scheduled arraignment date." Md. Pub. Saf. Code Ann. §2-504(d)(1)/
     And King's first appearance in court was not until three days after
     his arrest. (I suspect, though, that they did not wait three days to
     ask his name or take his fingerprints.)...

     The truth, known to Maryland and increasingly to the reader: this
     search had nothing to do with establishing King's identity.

     It gets worse. King's DNA sample was not received by the Maryland
     State Police's Forensic Sciences Division until April 23, 2009--two
     weeks after his arrest. It sat in that office, ripening in a storage
     area, until the custodians got around to mailing it to a lab for
     testing on June 25, 2009--two months after it was received, and
     nearly three since King's arrest. After it was mailed, the data from
     the lab tests were not available for several more weeks, until July
     13, 2009, which is when the test results were entered into
     Maryland's DNA database, together with information identifying the
     person from whom the sample was taken. Meanwhile, bail had been set,
     King had engaged in discovery, and he had requested a speedy
     trial--presumably not a trial of John Doe. It was not until August
     4, 2009--four months after King's arrest--that the forwarded sample
     transmitted (without identifying information) from the Maryland DNA
     database to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's national database
     was matched with a sample taken from the scene of an unrelated crime
     years earlier.

   You know who else knows the "we're just doing this to identify people"
   argument is bullshit? Gov. Martin O'Malley, says Justice Scalia:

     The Governor of Maryland, in commenting on our decision to hear this
     case, said that he was glad, because "[a]llowing law enforcement to
     collect DNA samples . . . is absolutely critical to our efforts to
     continue driving down crime," and "bolsters our efforts to resolve
     open investigations and bring them to a resolution." Marbella,
     Supreme Court Will Review Md. DNA Law, Baltimore Sun, Nov. 10, 2012,
     pp. 1, 14. The attorney general of Maryland remarked that he
     "look[ed] forward to the opportunity to defend this important
     crime-fighting tool," and praised the DNA database for helping to
     "bring to justice violent perpetrators."

     ...The Maryland regulations implementing the Act confirm what is now
     monotonously obvious: These DNA searches have nothing to do with
     identification.

   Also, Justice Scalia explains, this ain't fingerprinting, and it ain't
   fast:

     The Court does not actually say whether it believes that taking a
     person's fingerprints is a Fourth Amendment search, and our cases
     provide no ready answer to that question. Even assuming so, however,
     law enforcement's post-arrest use of fingerprints could not be more
     different from its post-arrest use of DNA. Fingerprints of arrestees
     are taken primarily to identify them (though that process sometimes
     solves crimes); the DNA of arrestees is taken to solve crimes (and
     nothing else).... The Court asserts that the taking of fingerprints
     was "constitutional for generations prior to the introduction" of
     the FBI's rapid computer-matching system. This bold statement is
     bereft of citation to authority because there is none for it. The
     "great expansion in fingerprinting came before the modern era of
     Fourth Amendment jurisprudence," and so we were never asked to
     decide the legitimacy of the practice. As fingerprint databases
     expanded from convicted criminals, to arrestees, to civil servants,
     to immigrants, to everyone with a driver's license, Americans simply
     "became accustomed to having our fingerprints on file in some
     government database."  But it is wrong to suggest that this was
     uncontroversial at the time, or that this Court blessed universal
     fingerprinting for "generations" before it was possible to use it
     effectively for identification.

     The Court also assures us that "the delay in processing DNA from
     arrestees is being reduced to a substantial degree by rapid
     technical advances." The idea, presumably, is that the snail's pace
     in this case is atypical, so that DNA is now readily usable for
     identification. The Court's proof, however, is nothing but a pair of
     press releases--each of which turns out to undercut this argument.
     We learn in them that reductions in backlog have enabled Ohio and
     Louisiana crime labs to analyze a submitted DNA sample in twenty
     days.  But that is still longer than the eighteen days that Maryland
     needed to analyze King's sample, once it worked its way through the
     State's labyrinthine bureaucracy. What this illustrates is that
     these times do not take into account the many other sources of
     delay. So if the Court means to suggest that Maryland is unusual,
     that may be right--it may qualify in this context as a paragon of
     efficiency. (Indeed, the Governor of Maryland was hailing the
     elimination of that State's backlog more than five years ago. See
     Wheeler, O'Malley Wants to Expand DNA Testing, Baltimore Sun, Jan.
     11, 2008, p. 5B.) Meanwhile, the Court's holding will result in the
     dumping of a large number of arrestee samples--many from minor
     offenders--onto an already overburdened system: Nearly one-third of
     Americans will be arrested for some offense by age 23. See Brame,
     Turner, Paternoster, & Bushway, Cumulative Prevalence of Arrest From
     Ages 8 to 23 in a National Sample, 129 Pediatrics 21 (2011).

     What DNA adds--what makes it a valuable weapon in the
     law-enforcement arsenal--is the ability to solve unsolved crimes, by
     matching old crime-scene evidence against the profiles of people
     whose identities are already known. That is what was going on when
     King's DNA was taken, and we should not disguise the fact. Solving
     unsolved crimes is a noble objective, but it occupies a lower place
     in the American pantheon of noble objectives than the protection of
     our people from suspicionless law-enforcement searches. The Fourth
     Amendment must prevail.

   Which leads us to the Big Finish, and it's a big one:

     The Court disguises the vast (and scary) scope of its holding by
     promising a limitation it cannot deliver. The Court repeatedly says
     that DNA testing, and entry into a national DNA registry, will not
     befall thee and me, dear reader, but only those arrested for
     "serious offense[s]." I cannot imagine what principle could possibly
     justify this limitation, and the Court does not attempt to suggest
     any. If one believes that DNA will "identify" someone arrested for
     assault, he must believe that it will "identify" someone arrested
     for a traffic offense. This Court does not base its judgments on
     senseless distinctions. At the end of the day, logic will out. When
     there comes before us the taking of DNA from an arrestee for a
     traffic violation, the Court will predictably (and quite rightly)
     say, "We can find no significant difference between this case and
     King." Make no mistake about it: As an entirely predictable
     consequence of today's decision, your DNA can be taken and entered
     into a national DNA database if you are ever arrested, rightly or
     wrongly, and for whatever reason.

     The most regrettable aspect of the suspicionless search that
     occurred here is that it proved to be quite unnecessary. All parties
     concede that it would have been entirely permissible, as far as the
     Fourth Amendment is concerned, for Maryland to take a sample of
     King's DNA as a consequence of his conviction for second-degree
     assault. So the ironic result of the Court's error is this: The only
     arrestees to whom the outcome here will ever make a difference are
     those who have been acquitted of the crime of arrest (so that their
     DNA could not have been taken upon conviction). In other words, this
     Act manages to burden uniquely the sole group for whom the Fourth
     Amendment's protections ought to be most jealously guarded: people
     who are innocent of the State's accusations.

     Today's judgment will, to be sure, have the beneficial effect of
     solving more crimes; then again, so would the taking of DNA samples
     from anyone who flies on an airplane (surely the Transportation
     Security Administration needs to know the "identity" of the flying
     public), applies for a driver's license, or attends a public school.
     Perhaps the construction of such a genetic panopticon is wise. But I
     doubt that the proud men who wrote the charter of our liberties
     would have been so eager to open their mouths for royal inspection.

     I therefore dissent, and hope that today's incursion upon the Fourth
     Amendment, like an earlier one, will some day be repudiated.

   Is it just me, or is [36]Minority Report feeling more like a
   documentary every day?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,

       I need to read the entire opinion, but my initial reaction
       is...this is unbelievable.
       One of the most significant SCOTUS rulings we've had in a long
       time, and one that will be with us for a very, very long time. I'm
       not sure people will realise just how far reaching the implications
       of this ruling will be.

       database even if they are never convicted, even if they are never

       people that are arrested for a crime that they didn't commit , but
       have DNA found at a crime scene from years before the current
       arrest?
       "Yes, so look, we busted into the con...er suspects house, shot a
       bunch of his kids, his wife committed suicide and yeah it turns out
       he wasn't anywhere near THIS crime. BUT he was near a porn crime 6
        years ago. So we in fact got the right man just for the wrong
       crime. Crime is crime though and we got the fucker. So don't even
       think about suing us. This Con er..ah...fuckit... is going to jail
       for a very long time. The most egregious offence of course was
       resisting arrest. Can't have that shit. Like the guy REALLY wanted
       to stay with his kids. Yeah right. "
       May seem outrageous but then again, it was outrage after outrage
       when people were beaten and jailed for exercising 1st amendment
       rights.
       DNA , like most proven sciences, can be and will be abused to

   this ruling will not really help the innocence project because law
   enforcement is not looking to exonerate anyone, but rather to convict
   people of unsolved crimes.  King's DNA sample is not being compared
   against the DNA samples of people convicted of crimes in which DNA
   evidence is available, but not used at trial, and who maintain their
   innocence.

   I wholeheartedly agree that eyewitnesses are extremely unreliable, but
   taking DNA samples from anyone who gets arrested isn't going to fix
   that problem.

       is likely to induce a bias toward the conviction of minorites,
       what's wrong with the feds taking DNA evidence from everybody at
       birth?
       I can't help but feel like this is the classic "good neighborhood
       problem" where people make amorphous arguments about personal
       privacy that have little actual impact.
       I want the crime to be lower in my neighborhood, and prosecuting
       people who actually, legitimately committed the crimes is a good
       way to do that.

   That is most certainly not the liberal position. There are lots of

   This of course would come at the cost of individual liberties, the

       Liberals trust government.
       We trust the government to tax, to regulate, to restrain the Free
       Market, to educate children, to discourage racism and sexism.
       We like a strong government that can get things done.
       It is the conservatives who want to limit government power, who
       want to drown the government in the bathtub, who see Black

       I'm sick of criminals. If we could get a 20% reduction in violent
       crime, I would gladly support a universal DNA database.

   Part of being a liberal has included a healthy skepticism of authority,
   including government, not only in the history of this country but all
   liberal democracies. And I disagree with your statement that a tenant
   of liberalism is a "trust in government". Did you trust the Bush
   administration?

   I'm not talking about the idiotic reflexive "government is always bad"
   attitude that permeates neo-conservatism. I'm talking about the defense
   of individual liberties, which has ALWAYS been a tenant of liberalism.
   The "liberal" position on abortion, for example, is the state can't
   tell a woman what to do with he body...which is definitely a limitation
   on the power of the state.

   The kind of government you describe above is how most progressives
   would see as the proper role of the state...but that has nothing to do
   with this ruling being the liberal position.

       So, just curious, do you know what the false positive rate is for
       DNA matching?
       The FBI estimates that the chances of a real false match (where
       both specimens were processed accurately) are smaller than one in
       113 billion. But somehow, we've already run across literally dozens
       of false matches. And as the pool of things to match against gets
       larger, this will grow by orders of magnitude. Scientists have not,
       so far, had a good explanation for this, and the FBI still (I
       believe, after five years) have not officially admitted that it
       happened, although there is independent corroboration. (And
       Arizona's law enforcement division has admitted to it.)
       And then there are laboratory errors. And then there are malicious
       substitutions. And then there are simple misinterpretations of the
       evidence, of the documentation, of something else.
       Any of these could be enough to haul some random person who has
       been guilty of nothing more than jaywalking into a hell of
       byzantine proportions, where they are suddenly required to prove
       where they were on a given night three weeks, or three months, or

       ...for all the documents you describe.
       Consider if facial recognition gets so good that an automated
       system can reliably match a police snapshot taken of a suspect at
       the instant of arrest against the passport and driver's license
       photo databases. Would you suggest we then prohibit the taking of
       "mug shots" by the police or prohibit comparing them to existing
       mug shots?
       Yes, I'm playing the devils advocate here, but I don't think DNA
       collection from suspects is much different than things we accept
       today without thought - it's just newer and people get scared by
       new things. For example, maybe we should object to automated
       fingerprint matching against large databases -- but the public was
       quite pleased with it in the case of the Night Stalker and I've not
       heard much uproar over such matching and databases.
       Taking a picture is slightly less invasive than a cheek swab. But,
       what if the police could just take a few discarded skin cells off
       the handcuffs the suspect was wearing to accomplish the same thing?
       Then DNA collection would be less invasive than taking a picture
       because the suspect would have to devote no time to the collection
       while standing for a mug shot usually takes at least tens of
       seconds (I think - I honestly have no experience with having a
       police mug shot taken, but I assume it's more time consuming than
       the DMV photo since they seem to take side and front shots).

       You cannot selectively collect only "a few data points". You
       collect everything in collecting the physical sample, then you
       decide what parts of it you want to look at, in terms of genes,
       markers, etc. Later, you can come back and look at other genes,
       etc. before you do any analysis, you can biochemically amplify the
       sample so that you have a practically  inexhaustible supply of the
       person's DNA, from which you can extract  the sequences of all the
       genes.
       For anyone who is not up on their molecular biology, here's an
       analogy. Let's say you want, for reasons of your own, to read every
       100th sentence of a new bestseller. The bookstore will sell you
       only the entire book, and the library will lend only the entire
       book. You borrow the entire book, then take it home, and because
       counting the sentences takes some time, you scan the whole book,
       and then read every tenth sentence. In doing this you notice
       something interesting, and decide that you really need to read
       every sixth sentence, and a couple of full paragraphs in Chapter
       15. So you go back to your scanned version, and do a little more
       reading. In the midst of this, you see a feature on TV that's
       related to the setting of the book, and now you suspect that there
       must be some related sentences in Chapter 4 that you should really
       read in full. And nothing stops you from doing this.

       ...if the swab was only used to extract the points used for
       identification and the original sample was, by law, discarded once
       these points had been extracted or thirty days after collection -
       whichever occurred first?
       The instant check program for firearms only passed because people
       trust the government to destroy the records within the time-frames
       and under the conditions specified by law. So, I can't see that
       "not trusting the police" to discard the sample is an adequate
       objection (esp. if the law said that evidence, and all its fruit,
       against a suspect from an illegally retained cheek swab is
       inadmissible).

 Vauge and misleading ([1152]0+ / 0-)

   Your citing specific cases along with a memorandum of law for the
   applicable statutes and why you think Scalia ruled properly would be
   appreciated.

   The other day you said that because the IRS took it on their own to
   make a ruling on a different standard than that of the law, their
   ruling should become a new standard
   with the existing law still on the books and conflicting, because it
   rather than the law determined expectations.

   That's a pretty dangerous slippery slope

   Suppose we were to assume that taking DNA from a suspect was not so
   much a law enforcement tool as a protection against being falsely
   accused, and that if you can't show the DNA of the accused was present
   at the crime scene in such a way as to prove their guilt beyond a
   reasonable doubt that should introduce a reasonable doubt they were
   guilty and require you to let them go.

       Better Business Bureau of Washington D.C., Inc. v. United States,
       326 U.S. 279 (1945). [1170]As the Congressional Research Service
       explains:

     In a 1945 case, the Supreme Court found that a Social Security Act
     requirement that an organization be operated "exclusively" for
     certain tax-exempt purposes "plainly means that the presence of a
     single [non-exempt] purpose, if substantial in nature, will destroy
     the exemption regardless of the number or importance of truly
     [exempt] purposes." In other words, an organization may engage in
     activities for a non-exempt purpose so long as those activities are
      insubstantial. The Court found the organization did not qualify for
     the exemption because "an  important, if not the primary, pursuit"
     of the group was engaging in non-exempt purpose activities.

     This case may provide support for the IRS's interpretation of the
     law to permit 501(c)(4) groups   to engage in some campaign activity
     even though the statute says they must be operated  "exclusively"
     for social welfare purposes. Additional support might be found in
     the IRC's income tax scheme on 501(c) groups with unrelated business
     income, as it may suggest that Congress  recognized 501(c)
     organizations could engage in some activity outside their tax-exempt
     purpose.
       As far as your question regarding "What ruling had the SCOTUS made
       that allowed the IRS to write its own laws without input from the
       Congress of the United States?", it's Chevron of course, and if you
       don't know that you really are out of your depth.

     However, even after Citizens United
     , 501(c)(4) groups are still subject to regulation under FECA and

     In a 1945 case, the Supreme Court found that a Social Security Act
     requirement that an organization be operated "exclusively" for

     single [non-exempt] purpose, if substantial in nature, will destroy

       The SCOTUS found the term "exclusively" to be the operative term
       and for the word to have plain meaning.
       As for Cheron, you didn't give a complete or proper cite so I chose
       to take it as referring to Bowoto v Chevron

     There are only two legal issues in this appeal, both relating to
     statutes Congress adopted to incorporate principles of international
     law. The first issue is whether the federal Death on the High Seas
     Act ("DOHSA") preempts wrongful death and survival claims brought
     under the ATS. The other legal issue is whether corporations can be
     found liable under the Torture Victim Protection Act ("TVPA"). We
     affirm the dismissal of the ATS wrongful death and survival claims
     and agree with the district court that Congress did not intend the
     TVPA to apply to corporations.
       further

     In a paralell to the Kiobel/Flomo split on whether corporations can
     be sued under ATCA/ATS, the 9th Circuit's decision in Bowoto v
     Chevron holds that corporations can not be sued under the TVPA.
     Judge Schroeder writes:

     We agree with the district court that Congress's use of the word
     ``individual'' throughout the statute indicates that it did not
     intend for the TVPA to apply to corporations. Indeed, Congress has

     Even the most liberal of constructions does not mean that statutory
     words and phrases are to be given unusual or tortured meanings
     unjustified by legislative intent or that express limitations on
     such an exemption are to be ignored. Petitioner's contention,
     however, demands precisely that type of statutory treatment. Hence
     it cannot prevail.

     In this instance, in order to fall within the claimed exemption, an
     organization must be devoted to educational purposes exclusively.
     This plainly means that the presence of a single non-educational
     purpose, if substantial in nature, will destroy the exemption
     regardless of the number or importance of truly educational
     purposes. It thus becomes unnecessary to determine the correctness
     of the educational characterization of petitioner's operations, it
     being apparent beyond dispute that an important if not the primary
     pursuit of petitioner's organization is to promote not only an
     ethical but also a profitable business community. The exemption is
     therefore unavailable to petitioner.

 On the chance you mean the Chevron Doctrine ([1192]0+ / 0-)

   Limits on the authority granted to a federal agency occur within the
   statutes enacted by Congress.

   As regards administrative deference and the legal test for determining
   whether to grant deference to a government agency's interpretation of a
   statute which it administers, the test is:

     (1) "First, always, is the question whether Congress has spoken
     directly to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress
     is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court as well as
     the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of
     Congress."

   Regarding  the Chevron Doctrine in the case of the IRS substituting
   "substantial" for "exclusively"  where Congress has used the word
   "exclusively" the meaning of the word "Exclusively" is plain and
   unambiguous. Only if Congress has not addressed the issue can the court
   impose its own construction.

     "If the Court determines Congress has not directly addressed the
     precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own
     construction of the statute . . . Rather,

     (2) [I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the
     specific question, the issue for the court is whether the agency's
     answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute."
     Chevron U.S.A. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 842-843 (1984).

     Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
     U.S. 837 (1984),[1] was a case in which the United States Supreme
     Court set forth the legal test for determining whether to grant
     deference to a government agency's interpretation of a statute which
     it administers. Chevron is the Court's clearest articulation of the
     doctrine of "administrative deference," to the point that the Court
     itself has used the phrase "Chevron deference" in more recent
     cases.[2]

     Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1977 to address states that
     had failed to attain the air quality standards established by the
     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Defendant). "The amended
     Clean Air Act required these 'non-attainment' States to establish a
     permit program regulating 'new or modified major stationary sources'
     of air pollution."[3] During the Carter administration, the EPA
     defined a source as any device in a plant[clarification needed] that
     produced pollution. In 1981, after Ronald Reagan's election, the EPA
     adopted a new definition that allowed an existing plant to get
     permits for new equipment that did not meet standards as long as the
     total emissions from the plant itself did not increase. The Natural
     Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an environmental protection group,
     challenged the EPA regulation in federal court, which ruled in their
     favor.[4] Chevron, an affected party, appealed the lower court's
     decision.

       Federalists carved out a role for the courts. This do nothing
       Congress is now forcing the president to pack the courts in order
       to bring to a head the issue of appointments not being confirmed.
       Federal Agencies full of Bush Stay behinds, Courts without judges,
       media which repeats falsehoods simply to pump up their ratings,
       cynical lawyers educated by the Federalist Society, all combine to
       make the written law no longer something carved in stone, sacred

 Agencies can't do that ([1255]0+ / 0-)
       Congress and the government are dysfunctional for many reasons. For
       starters because appointments to head and staff the agencies are
       blocked, filibustered and obstructed.
       Funding for them is cut and reasonable elaborations upon what
       Congress enacted such as new regulations controlling banking,
       mountain top removal, alcohol tobacco and firearms are not
       promulgated.
       Meanwhile the legislation that is written is so packed with special
       provisions for special interests, tax loopholes, deregulated
       environmental exemptions, subsidies and other workarounds to evade
       and avoid any enforcement of regulations that do exist that
       agencies can't do their jobs
       The original intent of the 1913 law giving tax exemptions to social
       welfare non profits was that they be exclusively concerned with
       social welfare

     [1256]IRC 501(c)(4) provides for exemption from federal income tax
     of civic
     leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated
     exclusively for the promotion of social welfare.
       The IRS has defined what is meant by social welfare.
       Corporations, among them the media, have conspired among themselves
       to use their lobbying abilities to obstruct the IRS ability to
       review and deny their desires for tax exempt status in
       contravention to the statute.
       Both the law and the agency have been anything bu vague in spelling
       out what the exemptions are for
       and what is grounds for denying the exemption.

     501(c)(3) -- Religious, Educational, Charitable, Scientific,
     Literary, Testing for Public Safety, to Foster National or
     International Amateur Sports Competition, or Prevention of Cruelty
     to Children or Animals Organizations.
     501(c)(4) -- Civic Leagues, Social Welfare Organizations, and Local
     Associations of Employees
       Political activities are not included in the exclusive activities
       elected to be approved for the exemption. The SCOTUS has ruled that
       a single instance of such a non approved activity is considered
       substantial enough to disallow the exemption
       This is still reflected in the IRS tax forms. Articles of
       incorporation are required in order to get a 501(c)(3) exemption:
       In the articles of incorporation a clause stating that the
       corporation was formed for a recognized 501(c)(3) tax-exempt
       purpose (e.g., charitable, religious, scientific, literary, and/or
       educational), and a clause stating that that any assets of the
       nonprofit that remain after the entity dissolves will be
       distributed to another 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit -- or to a
       federal, state, or local government for a public purpose are

   he had lost Roberts?

   I think the case is wrongly decided  for the reason Scalia set forth in
   the last part.  But at the same time so many people are wrongly
   convicted based on unreliable and manipulable eyewitness
   identifications.  If I thought the DNA collected would exonerate a
   significant number of people wrongly convicted for the past crimes I
   would feel better.

   Unintended consequences are a real problem.  After all, in the later
   part of the 20th century civil libertarians, myself included,
   strenuously resisted creation of national ID cards like what they have
   in Europe.  But if we had done that, the voter suppression tactics of
   the GOP would have been much less effective.  All those older people
   without birth certificates would have gotten cards because they weren't
   the problem then.  And we also wouldn't have ended up mixing financial
   info with citizenship status the way we have by using SS numbers
   instead.

       at least philosophically (as opposed to legally), just 'how much
       power do you want the police/gov't to have?' (The reason there's
       some unusual bedfellows, I suppose, is that some people are hearing
       'the government' and others 'the police.')
       If the police can take a person's DNA when she is suspected of a
       serious crime, they can take her DNA when she's suspected of a
       less-serious crime. Trespassing. Disturbing the peace. Then they
       can--for the same rationale, and I'm sure it's coming--take a cheek
       swap before issuing a driver's license. And then, instead of a
       footprint at the hospital, a DNA sequence. I mean, why not? It will
       protect a lot of innocent people.
       Would people who are okay with this have any problem with the
       requirement that we have DNA on file before being issued a Social
       Security number?

 I've not read the decision/dissent yet... ([1333]0+ / 0-)

   ...either, but from Adam's summary I agree that in this case, Scalia
   got it right. The primary purpose of collecting DNA was not, even
   vaguely, for identification purposes in this case.

   However, the reality is that it's likely that in the not too distant
   future, the speed of DNA matching against a database will be
   sufficiently fast, easy, and cost effective that it will become a
   primary law enforcement identification/verification tool just as
   fingerprints are today. Indeed, it may become faster, easier, cheaper,
   and more accurate to collect and match a DNA sample in the field than a
   fingerprint is today.

   Once technology takes us across that bridge, I think the majority's
   conclusion will be right as a general rule -- although I really don't
   like that result emotionally. If it's wrong, then fingerprint databases
   and automated matching would also be wrong.

   However, I wish the majority had the patience to wait for a case where
   their opinion made sense.

   The state tried to pass a law to require DNA collection at arrest. A
   group of us worked with the state's attorney who was most involved with
   it to get the law changed as follows:

     DNA sampling only takes place after two steps:
     (1) a State's Attorney decided to prosecute as a felony; and,
     (2) a judge determined probable cause for the search.

     This is coupled with a program for preservation and destruction,
     under judicial supervision.

   I strongly urge people to start working REALLY hard in your own state
   to get something similar put into law. It won't affect federal arrests
   in the state, but can at least prevent automatic DNA collection for
   local, county, and state arrests.

   When I am on the same side as Justice Antonin Scalia.  I hate the man.
    I admit this.  Shame that as it relates to jurisprudence, except for
   those far too-many-times when his virulently hateful right wing nature
   gets in the way of his brilliant reasoning abilities, he's a brilliant
   jurist.

   Sadly, this outcome was not all that surprising to me.  When Professor
   Barbara Babcock told our Criminal Procedure that the Fourth Amendment
   was dead for all intents and purposes and it was just a matter of time
   more than 20 years ago, she had it right.

     It is undisputed that defendant did not threaten, fight with, or
     physically resist the officers at any time; rather, he simply
     refused to open his mouth to allow the officers to obtain a buccal
     swab. . . We cannot agree with the suppression court that, after 10
     to 15 minutes of asking a suspect to comply with a court-ordered
     buccal swab of which the suspect had no prior knowledge, it is
     reasonable for the police to tase a nonviolent, handcuffed, and
     secured defendant in order to force the suspect into submission.

     While the People seek to characterize the use of a taser as a
     "minimal" degree of force and emphasized at the suppression hearing
     that defendant did not lose consciousness and suffered no visible
     scarring or injuries, we note that "extreme pain can be inflicted
     with little or no injury" (Hickey, 12 F3d at 757). The officers who
     witnessed the tasing incident acknowledged that the use of a taser
     causes pain and that, upon application of the taser, defendant
     appeared to be in pain and shouted for the officers to stop using
     it. Our review of a videotape of the tasing incident supports the
     conclusion that defendant was in pain upon application of the taser
     to his bare skin.

       thought.  In fact, I get along well with the police that walks the
       beat on my street, the kids interact with the police, and many of
       them look up to and want to be police.   And our police has monthly
       meetings with the neighborhood to discuss issues.
       I don't think it should be a tenant of progressivism that "police =
       evil".   That is stupid.
       BTW, Sotomayor, whom progressives trashed when she was nominated
       because she was a former prosecutor, sided with you today.  You
       can't simply assume that a former prosecutor would side one way or
       that a former defense attorney would side another way.  The
       position of judge is different than that of prosecutor or defense
       attorney, and people will take different positions depending on the
       hats that they are wearing.
       Defense attorneys and prosecutors are opposing sides in the
       adversarial judicial system, and you can't presume that whatever
       position they take on a given issue as defense attorney or
       prosecutor is the same position they'd take as a judge.  Indeed,
       many lawyers have spent time both as prosecutors and defense
       attorneys, and therefore over the course of their career might take
       a position on an issue conflicting with a previous position they
       took on a similar issue, simply because they switched from being
       prosecutor to defense attorney (or the reverse).

       And doesn't he refute the necessity of taking samples from
       arrestees "for identification purposes?"  There will be plenty of
       times getting a DNA sample is justified.  In many of those cases, a
       judge will probably have to issue a search warrant in order to make
       it legal (not so much now, though).  There will be other instances
       where probably cause exists.  But in this case, there was no
       probable cause for the earlier crime.  Seizure of the evidence is

   1. The method of taking DNA is more physically intrusive.
   2. Fingerprints are much tougher to match to past crimes.
   3.  Timing.

   Try to picture the below as a two-column chart:

     Fingerprints of arrestees are taken primarily to identify them
     (though that process sometimes solves crimes); the DNA of arrestees
     is taken to solve crimes (and nothing else). Contrast CODIS, the
     FBI's nationwide DNA database, with IAFIS, the FBI's Integrated
     Automated Fingerprint Identification System. See FBI, Integrated
     Automated Fingerprint Identification System,
     [1833]http://www.fbi.gov/... (hereinafter IAFIS).

     Fingerprints

     DNA Samples

     The "average response time for an electronic criminal fingerprint
     submission is about 27 minutes." IAFIS.

     DNA analysis can take months--far too long to be useful for
     identifying someone.

     IAFIS includes detailed identification information, including
     "criminal histories; mug shots; scars and tattoo photos; physical
     characteristics like height, weight, and hair and eye color."

     CODIS contains "[n]o names or other personal identifiers of the
     offenders, arrestees, or detainees." See CODIS and NDIS Fact Sheet.

     "Latent prints" recovered from crime scenes are not systematically
     compared against the database of known fingerprints, since that
     requires further forensic work.

     The entire point of the DNA database is to check crime scene
     evidence against the profiles of arrestees and convicts as they come
     in.

       If the police get the swab collection/analysis wrong and record you
       in the database matching you with the wrong profile, you simply
       have the test redone with your lab doing the test and the
       prosecution's case falls apart in minutes (when analysis gets that
       fast). Your DNA doesn't change that significantly over time. This
       can be done decades later (even after death, your ancestors can do
       it to clear your name if you were not cremated or lab samples are
       left in your medical archives).
       You can always prove that the police cheek swab was recorded
       incorrectly. That's not the case with the alcohol analysis because
       a sample taken three days later is no longer representative of your
       BAC at the time your driving under the influence was supposedly
       observed.

   Sampling DNA without cause places the accused in the position of
   defending himself against crimes other than the one for which he has
   been charged and processed. Could a DNA sample provide circumstantial
   evidence to prosecute someone for a crime they did not commit?
   Certainly. People are convicted daily baed on circumstantial evidence
   that is not gathered by this method. DNA sampling raises the awful
   legal specter of someone having to prove their innocence of having
   committed a crime which is, itself, Napoleonic.

       fingerprints and mugshots place the accused in same position, and

       that's never been used as an excuse to stop collecting mugshots and

     fingerprints and mugshots place the accused in same position, and

       That is not in question. As I said - people are convicted every day
       on circumstantial evidence. Some of them are innocent of the
       charges. Nevertheless, it happens.
       Mugshots and fingerprints are collected pursuant to the
       investigation of a crime. Even in court, fingerprints must sustain
       the scrutiny of relevance. The court's majority decision today
       turns that notion on its head.
       The Fourth and Fifth Amendments are very specific about the issues
       of procuring confiscatory evidence that can be used for
       prosecutorial fishing expeditions. What gives the state cause to

   as a way of putting the suspect on the location of the crime, at a time
   near when the crime occurred.

   Most DNA evidence to this point has been like early fingerprinting.
   Only useful if you happen to find the dude who left the evidence and
   test them, and only if your DNA testing results actually got processed
   and returned in a useful time.

   DNA evidence collection is getting faster and cheaper.  Probably by
   2020, the turnaround will be similar to that of fingerprint databases
   (< 30 minutes) if all you're looking for is a match.    Right now the
   primary  bottleneck is there aren't enough DNA labs to keep up with the
   demand, and the sample has to be physically moved to the lab location.
      (unlike a Fingerprint, where an electronic image can go instantly to
   the central data store).

   You can capture a fingerprint's data in a few minutes with some ink.
   When portable DNA kits are available that can do the same thing
   (capture enough markers to compare to a central database) the DNA
   matching will be timely.

   I'm not saying this is necessarily something we want, but that's  where
   the technology is going to take us and it's too useful for it to be
   easily stopped.

     DNA analysis can take months--far too long to be useful for
     identifying someone.

   So, when technology reduces the average analysis and match to 26
   minutes, we're good with DNA swabs?

     "Latent prints" recovered from crime scenes are not systematically
     compared against the database of known fingerprints, since that
     requires further forensic work.

   But it IS done. Does this mean that the Night Stalker's conviction
   should be overturned since he was fingered by searching a (new and only
   partially constructed) fingerprint database? Seems like a weak argument
   - if police have the latitude to do something, the difficulty or cost
   of them doing it seems fairly irrelevant. If torture were hard, would
   we allow it?

   The EFF made the argument in California court-

     With this understanding of the search at issue here, it becomes
     clear just how "invasive" DNA collection is. And comparing DNA to
     fingerprints clearly fails to capture the essence of a DNA
     collection and search. The intrusiveness of a fingerprint is limited
     to cataloging the pattern of loops and whorls on a person's finger.
     Unlike a fingerprint, DNA searches involve "intrusion into the
     widest spectrum of human privacy."

     Judge Rendell of the Third Circuit has warned, an "intact,
     unanalyzed DNA sample contains a vast amount of sensitive
     information" beyond simply "the individual's identity, including
     familial lineage and predisposition to over four thousand types of
     genetic conditions and diseases and, potentially, genetic markers
     for traits including aggression, sexual orientation, substance
     addiction, and criminal tendencies."

     And Judge Reinhardt of the Ninth Circuit has noted DNA evidence can
     capture a person - and his or her relatives' - medical history,
     including "genetic defects, predispositions to diseases, and perhaps
     even sexual orientation."

   I don't want to think what the government can do with that info, now we
   all have to.

   To the extent that fingerprints are taken and run immediately after
   arrest, that serves the purpose of "identification" as it allows police
   to check if the arrestee has used other names.  The DNA testing was
   done weeks later, and so could not conceivably have actually been for
   the purpose of confirming the identity of the arrestee.  It was
   explicitly for the purpose of crime-solving.  The constitutional issue
   is that the search of the arrestee is essentially suspicionless (except
   as used for the crime for which he was arrested).  Generally,
   suspicionless searches are unconstitutional.  The majority insists that
   it is not a suspicionless search because the purpose of DNA testing is
   "identification" not "crime-solving."

       They are forced to release me because my alibi is strong.
       4) Weeks later, the test comes in. My DNA matches the crime scene.
       Now they do an intensive investigation, it turns out my "alibi" was
       faked and I'm the criminal.
       5) Justice is done.

       Those are neither the facts, nor the implication for the 4th

       In your hypothetical, you are arrested because of a particularized
       suspicion that you committed the crime being investigated.  The
       arrest for the crime being investigated (assuming that is a proper
       arrest) would give the police the constitutional grounds to take a
       DNA swab (whether or not you had an alibi).  Thus, your hypo has
       nothing to do with King.
       King was arrested for something unrelated to, and the police were

       Scalia's point is that the DNA was not in any way used for
       identification.  If the police are collecting DNA in the hope that
       it may be useful in solving a yet to be committed crime, that is
       also not in the service of identification, and thus would also be
       unreasonable (at least as I understood the 4th Amendment before

   guilt, courts do.

   Second, DNA is unique, unless we have clones running around or
   identical twins. Your DNA is not identical to your relatives, you share
   markers, but  we all share a large number of markers, regardless of how
   related we are.

   Third, those people are already fingerprinted if they are being
   arrested for something, and their fingerprints remain in the database
   regardless of guild.

   Fourth, you've said nothing that addresses my question of how
   collecting DNA is different from collecting fingerprints.

       Your DNA is overwhelmingly not unique: you and your sibs have your
       parents' DNA, with different contributions from your grandparents
       due to recombination in your parents' germ lines. But your parents
       are the only source for your DNA. You have some variant bases from

   "Criminals" implies that this is taking DNA samples from people
   convicted of crimes. This appears to be taking (and preserving) DNA
   samples from people arrested, regardless of whether they are ever
   actually charged or taken to trial. It's very easy to arrest then
   release with no charges filed.

   Internationally there's quite a bit of case law out there on the
   retention of DNA from people not actually convicted of crimes, and I'm
   pretty sure this decision makes the USA stand out in being different.

   the "cold" cases that are solved, are solved because of DNA technology
   that wasn't available when the murder occurred.

   To me, DNA testing and evidence should be used just the same as
   fingerprinting is used.

   Think of the men convicted of rape and/or murder before DNA testing who
   have recently been released due to the new technology.  One of the Cold
   Case file cases involved a woman who was not convicted, but was
   suspected and vilified for years for the murder of her husband, before
   the true killer was revealed by DNA evidence.

   Convicted criminals already have fewer rights.

   This is about the police being able to arrest ANYONE and grab a sample
   of their DNA in order to solve cases. Not convict - arrest. And, as
   Scalia points out, there's no real case to be made for allowing DNA
   sampling only in the case of arrests for violent crimes; police could
   just overcharge with a violent crime, or they could get the case law
   loosened to allow DNA testing for all arrestees. From there it's just a
   matter of arresting everyone once, or maybe just getting it over with
   and DNA sampling at birth. DNA doesn't change (significantly), and they
   can keep the DNA records.

   Imagine: a child is sexually assaulted and murdered. The police go
   around rousting out anyone they think might be involved and arrest
   them, allowing them to DNA sample anyone they want in the neighborhood.
   If they find a match - crime solved. If they did this in search of a
   knife or trace samples on clothing they'd be slapped silly by the
   courts. But, hey - case solved, so it's all good.

   No. The Fourth Amendment says we have a right to be reasonably secure
   in searches, and the Fifth says we can refuse to incriminate ourselves.
   DNA sampling moots both.

   Or require DNA to be taken at birth and stored in a database.  That
   way, if a crime is committed, even petty theft, a dna swab can be done

   Or just implant a mini-taser in everyone, so if we ever get out of

   but I'm reminded of the fact that already four years ago,
   [2564]scientists demonstrated the practical ability to fabricate DNA
   evidence from stored profiles in a DNA database:

     The scientists fabricated blood and saliva samples containing DNA
     from a person other than the donor of the blood and saliva. They
     also showed that if they had access to a DNA profile in a database,
     they could construct a sample of DNA to match that profile without
     obtaining any tissue from that person.

     "You can just engineer a crime scene," said Dan Frumkin, lead author
     of the paper, which has been published online by the journal
     Forensic Science International: Genetics. "Any biology undergraduate
     could perform this."

       This is the central point of the case.
       If the DNA is collected to "identify the suspect" for the purposes
       of the crime in question, then it's like fingerprinting.
       In this case, though, the DNA wasn't collected to identify the
       suspect - it was collected to link arrestees - note: not convicted
       criminals, but anyone booked by the police (think protesters) - to
       crimes completely unrelated to the one in question. That lack of
       relationship between arrest and sampling is the "gotcha".
       In the end, the latter eventually amounts to the police running
       dragnets to sample as many people as they can for DNA testing "just
       in case there's a match". No good reason. It violates both the
       Fourth and Fifth amendments.

        I guess it's just the conservative part of being a moderate
       democrat coming out of me but DNA was left at the first crime scene
       just like a fingerprint. It's like I said before we probably
       haven't heard just whatever other evidence  there was.
         Sorry but I agree for the most part in the decision but will
       admit DNA isn't the end all to be all. If one finds one's DNA in a
       murdered rape victim all it proves is that you had sex with them
       not neccessarily that you murdered the victim  or DNA might prove
       you were at the scene of the crime at some point. In the latter
       case lack of DNA also doesn't neccessarily prove one's innocence
       either.
         It all comes down to all the evidence as a whole not just what
       DNA says, and I feel we may not know just what else the Police had
       on this guy.

       And the reason we should be concerned with the legality of taking

 Fingerprints but not DNA? ([2675]0+ / 0-)
       So if DNA is bad how can finger prints be ok?  We have no problem
       requiring finger prints but somehow DNA is evil?
       [2676]http://www.lectlaw.com/...

     The gathering of fingerprint evidence from 'free persons'
     constitutes a sufficiently significant interference with individual
     expectations of privacy that law enforcement officials are required
     to demonstrate that they have probable cause, or at least an
     articulable suspicion, to believe that the person committed a
     criminal offense and that the fingerprinting will establish or
     negate the person's connection to the offense. See Hayes v. Florida,
     470 U.S. 811, 813-18 ('85); Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721,
     726-28 ('69).

     Nevertheless, everyday 'booking' procedures routinely require even
     the merely accused to provide fingerprint identification, regardless
     of whether investigation of the crime involves fingerprint evidence.
     See Smith v. U.S., 324 F.2d 879, 882 (D.C. Cir.'63) (Burger, J.)
     ('it is elementary that a person in lawful custody may be required
     to submit to . . . fingerprinting . . . as part of the routine
     identification processes'); Napolitano v. U.S., 340 F.2d 313, 314
     (1st Cir.'65) ('Taking fingerprints [prior to bail] is universally
     standard procedure, and no violation of constitutional rights.').
     Thus, in the fingerprinting context, there exists a constitutionally
     significant distinction between the gathering of fingerprints from
     free persons to determine their guilt of an unsolved criminal
     offense and the gathering of fingerprints for identification
     purposes from persons within the lawful custody of the state.
       The Constitutionality of fingerprints for those accused is settled
       law.  The use of those fingerprints to solve other crimes is also
       well established.  DNA is no different.

   was raped at gunpoint.  Some time later, the police believed they had
   the perpetrator.  She was asked to pick him out of a lineup.  She
   wasn't confident that her rapist was in the lineup and wasn't so
   anxious to convict someone, anyone, that would take a chance on picking
   the wrong person.

   In the meantime, the state where the crime was committed had developed
   a DNA database.  They found a match with DNA that had been removed from
   her body after the rape.  Turns out the rapist had been in either
   juvenile detention or prison his entire life for crimes against women.
    Had only been out of prison for 24 hours when he raped her and then
   another woman a few hours later.

   She agreed to be a witness in his trial, which was a very difficult
   thing to do.  He was found guilty and locked away for good.
   Subsequently, she was able to overcome the fear that he might come back
   or that he would traumatize another woman.  Furthermore, she didn't
   have to feel responsible for someone being charged and likely
   imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit.

   I have my concerns about DNA databases, as expressed above, but they

   I do not see how DNA is any more intrusive than fingerprinting.
   Scalia's argument is a slippery slope argument that in many ways
   invalidates the keeping of and searching fingerprinting databases.

   Let me just point out that if you do get arrested your finger prints
   will be taken, and the police will do an identity search on them.  If
   there are any unsolved crimes where your finger prints show up, they
   are going to want to keep you for some more questions.  And that is a
   good thing.

   Your DNA is just another biometric data point that differentiates you
   from other people.  And as for the idea that the DNA taken through a
   cheek swab can be planted, used to identify family members, identify
   genetic dispositions or diseases is only showing their ignorance of the
   science.

   A) The DNA taken through the swab is destroyed in the genotyping
   process, meaning that planting DNA only happens on TV and movies.
   B) Identifying family members through genotyping is incredibly
   imprecise unless you have a bunch of family members to compare against.
    Genotyping does not work in reality the way it does on TV.
   C) Genotyping the identify of a person (the cheap version) shows
   absolutely nothing about the diseases a person has or their genetic
   dispositions.  Tests like that costs thousands of dollars.  That type
   of genetic identifying only happens by the police in TV and movies.

       Yes Destroyed, as in the sample is no longer viable.  The process
       used in genotype identification immerses the entire sample in a dye
       that binds to the alleles of the subject.  After that the sample is
       run through a sequencer that creates the picture with the bars that
       we are used to seeing on TV and in the Movies.  But the sample at
       that point is useless and gets discarded as medical waste.
       And there is a significant difference in cost (time and monetary)
       in genotyping a person for identification purposes and searching
       for specific genetic markers for disease and genetic disposition.
       A simple genotyping that captures the small area used for
       identification is very inexpensive, trying to capture a specific
       part of the genome for a disease requires either using specific
       markers (but then you are only testing for the one disease) or
       sequencing the entire genetic string (which can take a couple of
       hours) and then having somebody spend days going through all of it
       to find anomalies.
       I am not a skeptic of our advances in technology for the future...
       what I am skeptical of is the will of any organization to want to
       spend the resources required to summon up the dystopian nightmares
       that some are suggesting will be caused by this decision.
       There is a lot of neo-Luddite born fear going on here, and if more
       people actually understood how limited genotyping identification
       was they would likely not be as fearful of it.

   Your answer makes it clear that you don't understand the subject. You
   seem to be referring to Sanger sequencing. Nothing about Sanger
   sequencing precludes amplifying the sample beforehand, and saving some
   of it to use for further analysis. In Sanger sequencing, you don't
   "immerse the entire sample in a dye that binds to the alleles";
   nucleotides coupled to different dyes and that terminate elongation of
   a new strand are incorporated into newly synthesized DNA. The DNA
   sequence is read by noting the positions of dye-marked termination
   events by use of gel electrophoresis (the source of the bars you see in
   the movies). Each column of bars is one sequencing reaction (one
   stretch of DNA, usually up to several hundred bases long).

   Sanger sequencing is being replaced in many applications by
   next-generation methods that simultaneously record base incorporation
   events in hundreds of thousands of reactions taking place on a chip.
   The amount of data generated is orders of magnitude larger than with
   Sanger sequencing in the same time frame with the same number of
   personnel, and next-generation methods are getting cheaper all the
   time.

   Color me shocked, but his text is impeccable.

   This ruling also has far reaching implications regarding DNA
   "ownership", and how that will play out in the expanding era of
   personalized medicine and genomics.

   Entire genome sequencing only costs about $5,000-$10,000, and while
   that may seem a lot, remember that the Human Genome Project cost $3
   billion.

   We will eventually get to a point where sequencing our entire genome
   will be no more than a routine blood test ($50-$100), and there are a
   lot of ethical and legal implications for such a technological advance.

   We've been discussing this a lot on campus here at Penn.

 "Normal" =/= "right". ([2844]0+ / 0-)
       DNA is routinely taken and used to help solve cases where a suspect
       has already been identified - the suspect provides a DNA sample,
       and it's tested against those found at the scene etc. etc.
       I don't have a problem with that - and neither does Scalia.
       What Scalia has a problem with, as do I, is the notion that, having
       once taken a sample of your DNA in conjunction with Crime X, the
       State somehow has the right to keep that sample on file for the
       rest of your life and later on run it against the crime scene for
       Crime Y, without any grounds to believe that you were involved with
       Crime Y.
       And if you don't see the problem inherent to such a procedure
       becoming normalised, then I suggest you take a breather, then take
       a closer look - because it's not at all hard to see the ways
       various corrupt and/or ineffective police forces could routinely
       abuse this leeway.

 I'm so torn on this issue. ([2889]4+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [2890]Adam B, [2891]WillR, [2892]Eric Nelson, [2893]fuzzyguy

   I can't buy into this case because it rests on a false premise - the
   issue of identity.  It is extraordinarily rare to need to use DNA to
   identify a living person with certainty (excepting immigration, which
   is a different world).

   But, when used properly, DNA is a powerful tool, and I am not always
   sure what the original intent of the 4th Amendment was.  Many searches
   are of an invasive nature - a person has a right to peaceably engage in
   lawful activities in their homes, even those that might bring a person
   public disdain.  There is enormous value is personal privacy, the
   knowledge that a person can live without a causeless search of their
   person and effects.

   Does that include DNA?  I'm just not sure.  There's excellent arguments
   on both sides.

   Let's go forward in time 20 or 50 years - most arrestees are
   photographed if booked and that's not controversial today (note that in
   most jurisdictions, many misdemeanor defendants are cited and released
   and not booked).  But someday facial recognition will be as good as
   people think it is today and the police could take that photo, enter it
   into an AFIS for facial photos, and find out that an arrestee in Oregon
   is a suspect in a robbery in Florida.  When that technology is
   available, does that turn a photograph into a 4th Amendment search?
   What part of that process is the search, the taking of the photograph?
    The entering into a database?  The maintenance of the database?

   Finally, as a newbie defense attorney, there's a certain power to DNA.
    When I have clear evidence at our misdemeanor arraignments that a
   defendant is not guilty, I can often informally work with our
   prosecutors to get a dismissal, and failing that I can ensure that the
   case receives special attention in terms of the evidence that appears
   to exonerate the defendant.

   I primarily do arraignments, before a case is fully developed, and when
   I'm faced with a client whose guilt is going to be easy for the state
   to prove, I can give that person a fair measurement of what he or she
   is facing and help them make an intelligent decision of whether to take
   a plea to get back to their life quickly or, if they prefer, protect
   their rights to fight to the charges to the end.  But when I have no
   clue what's going on or what we're facing, whether a person is facing
   an oncoming freight train at trial or the prosecutor's case will
   quickly wilt when exposed to light, it can be a challenge for all
   parties to identify a good course of action.

   So, there's a reasonable counter-argument that DNA would help with
   that, when used appropriately and in a scientifically sound fashion.

   I'm not talking so much the legal precedent, which is complicated but
   does set out a clear course of rules (albeit the rules that just
   changed today).  Rather, I'm musing as to what the Constitution meant.
    And I just don't have a good answer.

   I wish that we would have a national debate about this issue, but that
   won't happen because we set the upper and lower limits of criminal
   procedure via Supreme Court ruling rather than legislative process, so
   we never actually have that discussion; we have delegated our
   regulation of this to nine Supreme Court justices.  And this is too
   important to delegate.

 I'm not sure if you read my comment... ([2908]0+ / 0-)
       My first paragraph:

     I can't buy into this case because it rests on a false premise - the
     issue of identity.  It is extraordinarily rare to need to use DNA to
     identify a living person with certainty (excepting immigration,
     which is a different world).
       So, I did indeed acknowledge that it seems that the reasoning in
       this particular case is very poor, and poor reasoning leads to poor
       case law (See e.g. Bush v. Gore, which despite its infamous caveat
       has indeed been cited in subsequent cases).
       There are debatable reasons for DNA on conviction or, perhaps, DNA
       on booking or arraignment, which is what has me torn, but today's
       court sidestepped that by focusing on a red herring.
       In fact, in the past year, amongst hundreds of arraignments or
       more, I can only thing of two times that identity was an issue, and
       I don't think that it was a real issue, I think that each time it
       was just some wise guy trying to gum up the works.  It just doesn't
       tend to arise, at least not at my level; I won't speak for felony
       work.

 I agree with the SCOTUS Majority ([2940]0+ / 0-)

   I consider myself a moderate-libertarian on most political matters, but
   I've never placed a high value on the right to privacy as most
   libertarians do. The more information the government has on its
   populace, the better decisions it will make. When most people express a
   desire for privacy I think what they are really expressing is a fear
   that the government will inevitably misuse the information it collects,
   or that they will be persecuted for illegal activities that the
   government is currently unaware of. Activities they believe cause no
   harm to society.

   While I certainly see the potential for abuse in a comprehensive DNA
   database, the benefits far outweigh the potential problems. I would
   focus on whether the laws that are being enforced are just, rather than
   the means of information collection to enforce them.
