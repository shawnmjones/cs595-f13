New Tylenol cap will have warning label

   By CNN Staff
   updated 7:37 AM EDT, Fri August 30, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * New caps will say: "Contains acetaminophen. Always read the label"
     * Company hopes to reduce number of accidental acetaminophen
       overdoses
     * FDA sets daily limit for adults at 4,000 milligrams of
       acetaminophen

   (CNN) -- Bottles of Extra Strength Tylenol will soon have a new warning
   on their caps: "Contains acetaminophen. Always read the label."

   The bright red lettering is an effort by Tylenol's parent company,
   Johnson & Johnson, to reduce the number of accidental acetaminophen
   overdoses that occur each year.

   "Acetaminophen overdose is one of the most common poisonings
   worldwide," according to the [41]National Institutes of Health.

   Taking too much of this pain reliever can cause severe liver damage.
   The Food and Drug Administration sets the maximum limit for adults at
   [42]4,000 milligrams per day. One gel tablet of Extra Strength Tylenol
   contains 500 mg.

   People should keep their doctor and pharmacist informed about all the
   medications they are taking to ensure that they are not consuming more
   than the daily limit, according to the FDA. They should also avoid
   taking acetaminophen with alcohol.

   "With more than 600 (over the counter) and prescription medications
   containing acetaminophen on the market, this is an important step
   because it will help remind consumers to always read the label,"
   Johnson & Johnson said in a statement about the new caps, which will
   arrive in October.
