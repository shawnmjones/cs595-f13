[24]Obama administration asks Supreme Court to strike down Defense of
Marriage Act

   Generic male and female couple figures, female-female, female-male, and
   male, male.
   [30]This is a very welcome Friday news dump:

     The Obama administration urged the Supreme Court to strike down the
     Defense of Marriage Act's prohibition on recognition of same-sex
     couples' marriages in a Friday filing, arguing that laws that target
     gay people should face additional scrutiny by courts reviewing them.

   You can read the full brief [31]here.

   Equality is coming, no matter how many [32]marches the bigots organize.
   And it's certainly nice to see the White House take a strong stand to
   be on the right side of history. You can help make it a reality in
   Oregon too, by [33]donating to Oregon United for Marriage.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [49]Tagging tips - [50]Search For Tags - [51]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       I would not be surprised if the court does strike it down, and I
       certainly have my fingers crossed.
       What is unfortunate about all this is that people felt the need to
       make laws barring same-sex marriage, thus making it a
       legal/constitutional problem. To an extent, that means that at the
       Federal level it comes down to legal arguments. Better would be for
       Congress to pass a law overturning it themselves, though I don't
       see that happening.
       Good luck to us!

 As of this moment ([192]0+ / 0-)
       It isn't unconstitutional until the supremes weigh in. You think it
       is, I think it is, most rational people think it is and more than a
       few courts think it is, but it is still on the books as a law until
       the Supreme strike it down or Congress kills it. So yes he must per
       his constitutional requirement enforce the laws of the US.

 That's one way to look at it. ([196]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [197]Adam B

       Another way is that an unconstitutional law is unconstitutional
       from the moment it is enacted.  Suppose Congress passed a law
       banning all criticism of Congress in the public forum, over the
       President's veto.  Clearly violates the First Amendment.  I think
       the President is completely within his power to ignore such a law.
        You shouldn't be forced to violate the Constitution by a different
       provision of the Constitution.

       The President does not have the authority to say sorry not

 Try again ([299]0+ / 0-)
       I've been active in LGBT rights groups since the early 90's. I met
       our President before he ran doing the same. He carries with him the

     Hate the "sin" love the "sinner"
       philosophy, probably from the normal source theocratic
       indoctrination.
       Denying he has feet of clay on LGBT rights is really hard to
       support.

     ...[300]he could do a lot more to support LGBT rights than just
     offer words of support. He dragged his feet on DADT repeal, he
     dragged his feet on marriage equality and he's still doing what he
     does, offer words but little action. His DoJ still won't file a
     brief in support of anti-DOMA cases before the supreme court. He
     doesn't believe that marriage equality should be a federal law, but
     a state-by-state patchwork. No he doesn't throw us under the bus,
     and yes he's been the most supportive president in history, but he

 He supported repealing DOMA in '07. ([305]0+ / 0-)
       It was part of his campaign platform. This action of opposing DOMA
       is the same position he always held. So my statement is 100%
       accurate.
       When he was a state Senator in the 90's he co-sponsored the bill
       adding sexual orientation to the Illinois human rights code, which
       would have added a long list of civil rights protections.
       No, he did not "drag his feet" on DADT. He started the process of
       repeal as soon as he took office, and did it in a way that brought
       the support of military leaders. Do you think it would have been
       better to do it in a way that left top leaders publicly fighting
       against the policy?
       Even when he didn't support marriage, he supported civil unions
       with the same legal rights as marriage, which still put him ahead
       of most politicians.
       I don't know what motivates all the selective quotes and deceptive
       spin about Obama and LGBT rights I've seen over the last four
       years, but I know the real story.

   I'm pleasantly surprised at how quickly public opinion has moved on
   marriage equality. And I'm happy that the administration is on board.

   Think what (shudder!) President Romney would have done, in the name of
   family values.

       This is what has happened with DOMA.
       I don't know why you would want to diminish its significance. The
       fact that the administration is refusing to defend DOMA is very
       significant to the litigants in the six pending DOMA lawsuits and
       to the courts hearing them. The signal from the White House is a
       powerful one.

   President "I'm Still Evolving" really and truly asked his justice

   Surprising.  Usually Vice President Biden has to drag BO out of the
   closet kicking and screaming.

   Well, better late than never, I guess, in search of truth, justice and
   the American way.

   Way to go, Mr. President.  Welcome to the party.

   Did you know that the President was a bigot before his position
   "evolved"? Consider these statements:

   "I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now,
   for me as a Christian -- for me -- for me as a Christian, it is also a
   sacred union. God's in the mix." Barack Obama- April 17, 2008

   "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of
   gay marriage. " Barack Obama-Nov. 2, 2008

 And before he ran for President ([357]0+ / 0-)
       he stated (when running for the Illinois senate) that he supported
       marriage equality. The flip-flop was cowardly of course but pretty
       typical. I don't think he really ever believed the things he said
       in 2008. He said what he thought was politically expedient at the
       time. Personally I find it a cowardly thing to have done but would
       he still have been elected in 2008 if he'd publicly supported
       marriage equality then?

 Yes, I think the President would have been elected ([362]0+ / 0-)
       in 2008 supporting marriage equality. I find that most things Obama
       says are for political expediency. I suspect he really doesn't have
       any core beliefs, other than a belief in a dominant Federal
       Government. That he hould flip flop on an issue such as this, where
       people tend to have strong opinions, illustrates his general lack
       of principle. His only guiding principle is that the ends justify
       the means.
       Does his flip flop on this issue make you angry?

 One of the weaknesses I find in the brief ([375]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [376]ebohlman

   is the rather cavalier and offhanded statement that the administration
   believes that DOMA would withstand a rational basis review (page 52 and
   elsewhere). I suppose they feel compelled to assert that in order to
   support the assertion that laws involving sexual orientation should be
   subject to heightened scrutiny.
