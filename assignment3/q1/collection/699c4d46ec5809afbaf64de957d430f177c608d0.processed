Chronicling Mitt's Mendacity, Vol. XIX

   Campaigning in Iowa yesterday, President Obama reflected on some of
   Mitt Romney's recent speeches, including last week's remarks in Iowa.
   "I know Governor Romney came to Des Moines last week; warned about a
   'prairie fire of debt,'" [3]Obama said. "But he left out some facts.
   His speech was more like a cow pie of distortion. I don't know whose
   record he twisted the most -- mine or his."

   It was a rhetorical point, of course, but when it comes to Romney's
   falsehoods, I'm not sure whose record he twists more, either. Maybe you
   can help me decide by taking a look at the 19th installment of my
   weekly series, chronicling Mitt's mendacity.

   1. In [4]an interview with Mark Halperin, Romney argued about President
   Obama, "Did he hold unemployment below 8%? It's been, what, 39 months
   now. That hasn't happened. He promised it would happen by virtue of his
   stimulus."

   As Romney surely knows by now, that's [5]simply not true.

   2. In the same interview, Romney asked, "Are people happy with ... the
   level of foreclosures?"

   Romney was trying to attack the administration, but he's on record
   supporting [6]more foreclosures, making this, at a minimum, wildly
   misleading.

   3. Romney added, in reference to the president, " Look at him right
   now. He just doesn't have a clue what to do to get this economy going.
   I do."

   Actually, Obama's jobs agenda, unveiled in September, included specific
   policy proposals that [7]Romney had previously endorsed. If the
   president "doesn't have a clue," then Romney doesn't have a clue.

   4. Romney went on to say, "I actually lay out a plan to get us to a
   balanced budget within eight years."

   That's plainly false. Romney says his plan "[8]can't be scored," but
   independent budget analysts have found his agenda would [9]make the
   deficit bigger, not smaller, and add trillions to the national debt.

   5. Romney also argued, in the context of talking about budget savings,
   "I'm going to take action immediately by eliminating programs like
   Obamacare, which become more and more expensive down the road -- by
   eliminating them, we get to a balanced budget."

   He's lying. In fact, this is the polar opposite of the truth --
   Obamacare's savings become greater in future years, and killing the law
   makes it harder to balance the budget.
     __________________________________________________________________

   6. Romney said, in addressing likely budget cuts, " I'd like my
   grandkids to be able to watch PBS. But I'm not willing to borrow money
   from China."

   The implication here is that U.S. debt is financed by the Chinese.
   [10]This isn't true -- China only holds about 8% of the nation's debt.

   7. On taxes, Romney argued, "I'm not looking to lower the tax burden
   paid by the highest-income Americans. That's a fundamental principle."

   That's a fundamental falsehood. Romney's plan [11]slashes taxes on the
   wealthy.

   8. On a related note, he added, "I'm looking, if there's any break at
   all, the break will go to middle-income Americans that have been most
   hurt by the Obama economy."

   In reality, it's the rich, not the middle class, that [12]primarily
   benefits from Romney's tax plan.

   9. In a speech in Washington, Romney insisted, "President Obama has
   decided to attack success."

   The Romney campaign has never been able to point to a single credible
   example of Obama attacking success.

   10. In the same speech, Romney added, "When the President took office
   ... he faced a spending crisis. It's only gotten worse."

   There is no universe in which this is [13]even close to being true.

   11. In making the case against Obama's student-loan reforms, the Romney
   campaign said it intends to "reverse President Obama's nationalization
   of the student loan market."

   This is demonstrably false -- the market wasn't nationalized. Since all
   kinds of private-sector banks still make all kinds of student loans,
   the argument doesn't even make sense.

   12. Romney told Fox News that "it certainly sounds like" the president
   is, as Rush Limbaugh put it, "running against capitalism." Romney
   added, "There's no question but that he's attacking capitalism."

   No sensible person could possibly believe this is true, and neither
   Romney nor his aides have ever provided an example of the president
   attacking capitalism. Obama routinely does the opposite.

   13. Romney argued in an op-ed that Obama "signed into law a budget
   scheme that threatens to saddle the U.S. military with nearly $1
   trillion in cuts over the next 10 years," which the president's own
   Defense Secretary criticized.

   That's [14]not even close to being accurate.

   14. Referencing Noam Scheiber's book, The Escape Artists, Romney
   argued, "In this book, [White House officials] point out that they said
   the American people will forget how long the recovery took. So that
   means they went into this knowing that when they passed Obamacare, it
   was going to make life harder for the American people."

   That's [15]not really what the book says, and it's not what the
   president's team argued.

   15. Romney boasted this week, in a rare reference to his one term as
   governor, "[W]e didn't just slow the rate of growth of our government,
   we actually cut it."

   [16]No, you didn't.

   16. The Romney campaign also argued this week that Romney created
   "[17]well in excess of 100,000" jobs as an executive at Bain Capital.

   [18]You've got to be kidding me.

   It is a good thing Mr. Romney is wealthy because his pants catch on
   fire so often with all of that lying, he must be spending a fortune on

   Anyone that believes you can save money by spending it is absolutely
   delusional.

   It's like my wife coming home from the mall on a full day of shopping
   exclaiming "I saved you soooooooooo much money."

   No FDH it's like saying that you save money by buying a home or paying
   for college. In fact you do not dispute the fact that going to college
   or buying a home saves you money (given your previous posts) so I'm
   going to call hypocrisy on this comment.

   hurt by the Obama economy."

   It is all about context. If you understand the context, Mittens is not
   lying about this one.

   The Mittens Scale

   Wealthy = Multi-Billionaires
   Well Off = Billionaires
   Middle Class = Fellow Quarter-Billionaires
   Lower Middle Class = Professionals and other who provide direct support
   to the Wealthy, Well Off, and Middle Class and receive multi $100K
   incomes for doing so
   Working Poor = Corporate Mid-Level Managers
   The Very Poor = the rest of the peon class (for whom Mittens has
   express no concern)

   Context, Steve, Context!

   Nice try, but even the GOP standard "middle class means people making
   $250K" can't save him. In the proposals Mitt has endorsed,
   multi-billionaires still get more of a break than quarter-billionaires.

     Romney asked, "Are people happy with ... the level of foreclosures?"

   Well, to be completely fair here, maybe he meant that he thinks people
   want more foreclosures, not less.

     In a speech in Washington, Romney insisted, "President Obama has
     decided to attack success."

   Perhaps he's worried that the President will "attack" his "success".

     Romney added, "When the President took office ... he faced a
     spending crisis..."

   Again, in all fairness, given the circumstances the nation faced, there
   was a spending crisis when the President took office. In the absence of
   corporate and consumer spending, the government wasn't spending nearly
   enough to get the economy moving again...

   Hey, Steve -- you know, I know it isn't polite to call someone a
   "liar," but lets be honest, most people don't know what "mendacity"
   means. IMHO, we should be worried more about making a case the most
   people can understand, rather than be clever / alliterative.

   To the extent that such things are to your taste (and I get your point,
   I really do), you should also listen to (or watch, now that it's
   carried on Current TV weekday mornings) Stephanie Miller's radio show -
   funny, and she never hesitates to call the likes of Willard "Reversible
   Mittens" Rawmoney a "lying sack of crap" when they deserve it. She even
   has a jingle about that which she plays whenever such liars say
   something particularly brazenly false... fun show. She's also had Dr.

   Hey Rachel, you can add two more: 1. Mitt spoke of no need to help poor
   because they had a safety net nor the rich because they don't need
   help, then he endorses the Ryan plan that takes away the safety net and
   rewards the rich with more; 2. Mitt says Obama doesn't understand what
   productivity is yet understanding productivity will find it in context
   of our own work and existence has doubled in the last 35 years while
   wages have gone flat after historically being commensurate to that
   productivity Remember the lady who said in paraphrase that if you want
   more money then work more, be more productive. The lady actually made a
   great point which is the center of a capitalistic economy as outlined
   by Adam Smith, Keynes and others, and self-responsibility, that work is
   rewarded for itself which is determined by productivity measures.

   It's no wonder he acts this way, he's defending his Avaricious
   Economical Policies. First thing to remember when someone's accused of
   something he's guilty of, they'll blame someone else of something
   similar. Obama can relate to any American Citizen, even if you don't
   agree with him 100%, you can relate to him on another degree. Mitt on
   the other hand can only relate to a small amount of American Citizens,
   so he tries and "ACTS" like he can to the other larger amount...

   He believes his lies...Lies are his control mechanism.

   Romney has a Narcissistic Personality Disorder..A Narcissus is very in
   love with self and is incapable of having empathy or sympathy for
   others. This psychopathic disorder must control everything and everyone
   around them. Their only sense of right and wrong is what and how it
   affects them and their goals.

   As long as the lies are accomplishing a sense of control for him which
   is what he wishes them to do. It they do not he flips them.

   This ability to lie, maneuver and to manipulate others is a trade mark
   tool that all Narcissistic Personalities use to control the environment
   and people around them in the ways that they want.

   They hide behind being a community leader, church goer, great neighbor
   and family man..What people think of them personally is very important
   to them. They crave the acceptance of others to reinforce their own
   sense of importance.

   Our prisons are full of them who feel they have a right to control
   their own lives by taking from others.....Serial killers fall into this
   physiologic disorder.

   We can only wish point 13 was true. Its hard to take a close look at
   the defense budget and not come away disgusted and amazed. As far as
   having a mature discussion as to what constitutes an appropriate level
   of defense spending is concerned, I'm afraid liberals are just as
   guilty of poisoning the well by linking any effort to make reasonable
   cuts to foolish pacifism at best, and downright anti-Americanism at
   worst.

   Over-spending on unnecessary and redundant weapon systems has been
   legendary in all branches of the service. Private suppliers disperse
   manufacturing facilities, not to increase economy or value, but to gain
   congressional votes in as many districts as possible.

   One incidental detail which speaks volumes: by my count, according to
   the U.S. Military's own website, we operate 150 military golf courses -
   125 in this country and 25 abroad. What, exactly, does the game of golf
   have to do with national defense? Does shooting in the low 80's make
   you a better Admiral?

   Mitt Romney has a Narcissistic Personality Disorder..And needs to have
   a physiological profile done. He actually believes his own lies,
   because his reality is what he wishes it to be..

   The Narcisstic Personality is controlling and has a very high opinion
   of self. They feel that it is not only their right, but an obligation
   as ordained by God that those who believe in Gods words and work hard
   will obtain prosperity and riches as the Bible says.

   Those who do not obtain riches are not following the laws of God and
   are nothing,but sinners who have brought about their own hardship by
   their own actions or lack there of.

   And the fact that Mitt believes that God is leading him only reinforces
   his believe that he is doing what God wants him to do. The Narcissistic
   Personality in men such as Hitler have brought about the worst crimes
   against humanity that has ever been.

   The examples of fine upstanding members of churches and communities who
   have been fine family men for all the outside world to see. Now sit in
   prisons convicted of serial murders...

   Their ability to lie and deceive is a trade mark ability of the
   Narcisstic Personality and they depend on it. In their own mind they
   are the only smart person and believe all other people are stupid.

   As a Canadian, I've always followed US politics closely. You're our
   neighbour, and what happens in Washington affects us, and the rest of
   the world for that matter. Romney is a spineless, lying D-Bag, who
   would say ANYTHING if he thought it might help get him elected. His
   record at Bain Capital, his performance as Governor of Massachusetts
   and total lack of any core beliefs should be more than enough to ensure
   an Obama landslide in November. But years of observation have convinced
   me that this election is going to come down to the wire. Pointing out
   Romney's consistent struggles with the truth will do nothing to
   convince the forty-something percent of Americans who want Obama out of
   office at any cost. I'm not sure I can think of a weaker Republican
   nominee in my lifetime, and I'm in my 30s. Sadly, there's a good chance
   this clown could win. And should that happen, I suspect that he might
   make everyone look back on the Bush years with longing.

   Who can sit at home on election day 2012 and not pull the lever for

   I doubt that you can reach the people who truly believe (what a
   concept) in Romney. I don't think I've ever seen a candidate with less
   content or specifics in his campaign. Whenever he's asked a serious
   question he just turns it around to an attack on Obama. He maintains
   that he "just knows" how to fix the economy because of his "25 years in
   the private sector", but when pressed for specifics its the same old
   drivel of tax cuts and deregulation. The more I read about him, it
   seems that in his years at Bain he was not really involved with the
   companies Bain bought, but basically a "face man" who dealt with the
   investors. In other words, a glorified salesman. Lies and vagueness are
   what he's selling now; hopefully he won't get enough buyers.

   One should avoid talking about what Mitt Romney actually did and didn't
   do at Bain Capital because such talk is now considered to be an unjust
   attack upon the Free Market itself. his character. And any mention of
   his unpopular one-term governorship is deemed to be an unfair attack
   upon his character, so one shouldn't talk about that either. And
   reminding voters of Romney's countless shifting of positions is seen as
   a personal attack, so that's out of bounds as well. And pointing out
   Romney's questionable and offensive behavior throughout his life is
   considered to be below the belt, as those issues should be left for
   history to decide. And it is beyond the pale to raise the issue that
   Romney received several deferments for a war and a draft that he
   supported, allowing others to serve and to sacrifice instead, because
   that would be a reprehensible attack upon his patriotism. And no one
   should mention Romney's taxes or his off-shore accounts or his Swiss
   bank accounts because that's all regarded as unappealing attacks of
   envy. And one should avoid pointing out that Romney has said that the
   Supreme Court should overturn Roe v. Wade, that he wants to get rid of
   Planned Parenthood, that he supports the Blunt/Rubio ammendment, that
   he supports a constitutional ammendment to establish the definition of
   life at conception, endorsed the Ryan budget that ends Medicare as we
   know it, opposes the Dream Act, and opposes economic equality and
   marriage equality, because raising those issues would divert attention
   from the "real issues."

   It is also recommended not to mention President Obama's successful
   mission of taking out Bin Laden, or asking the relevant question of
   what would Romney have done, because that's considered "despicable."
   One should also refrain from talking about how under President Obama's
   leadership we have seen 26 straight months (and counting) of private
   sector job growth, because any positive talk about the economy is truly
   upsetting for many on the right. And one should avoid mentioning that
   President Obama saved the American auto industry, because on further
   review, that's what Romney wanted to happen all along when he argued to
   "Let Detroit go bankrupt." It's advisable to avoid talking about any of
   the many accomplishments achieved by President Obama and his
   administration because that is now considered to be divisive partisan
   politics. And it's also suggested not to remind voters of the historic
   mess that the Bush administration left behind because that would be
   playing the blame game.

   It's probably best if one just talks about how Romney wonderously
   "saved" the Olympics. You know, the real issue of the campaign. But by
   all means, do not delve too deep into the issue, otherwise the
   uncomfortable inconvenient truths will be considered unfair partisan
   attacks upon Romney's character.

   kaneblues, very well said.

   But need I remind you & others that these are the exact same tactics
   Rove used while Bush was in office. "Either you are with us or against
   us." "Opposing the war is unpatriotic"or the equivalent of "committing
   treason."

   Given that Romney is this adverse to questions not to mention the truth
   just think what he'd be like as ... god forbid ... gulp ... president.
   If we did not support Romney's policies would that, too, be considered
   an act of treason or unpatriotic! As crazy as that may sound it really
   does not seem so far fetched when you stop & think about it. After all
   it worked while Bush was in office.

   Winning at any cost is too high a price to pay. because when the bill
   comes due we pay, the winner/s takes all thanks to Rove's despicable
   handiwork.

   PBS receives a some funding from the federal government. It's an
   infinitesimal portion of the federal budget, of course, yet Romney is
   suggesting it should be cut because of its impact on the debt--which he
   implies is all borrowed from China.

   By eliminating funding to PBS will make it more difficult for PBS to
   put together shows that provide information to the American people. In
   the past I loved to watch Bill Moyers on PBS. I believe conservatives
   would love to make sure that shows like Bill Moyers can not be put on
   air. If cutting the funding doesn't work well enough then they will
   come up something else in addition.

   The Republican strategy is so very simple it's almost genius in its
   stupidity:

   They know they can't beat Obama by just discussing the basic facts and
   the reality of the situation, so instead of trying to beat him with
   real facts they make stuff up about him to paint him as wildly
   unsuccessful, then sit back and pray both that the media won't
   rigorously fact-check their nonsense, and that the average American is
   dumb enough to buy what the Republicans are selling.

   Speaks a lot to their opinion of the average American, doesn't it? If
   someone considered me stupid enough to help elect to high office a man
   who lies to my face on a consistent basis, I'd be rather insulted.

   Then again I'm an ocean away from all this with my own lying jerk
   politicians to concern myself with. So I'm not even sure why I'm so
   invested in the Presidential Election when it has no effect on me at
   all...

   So what does Obama really offer other than increasing our national debt
   to the point of no return.

   outlaw12, I believe that the national budget is over budget by 40%.
   Hopefully you are not one that believes we should cut next years budget
   by 40%. To solve the budget problems we need people to discuss which
   programs are necessary and how much we need to spend on them. I believe
   Obama is willing to work with congress to solve the budget problems.
   There are people in congress that are determined to see Obama fail even
   to the detriment of the American people. Also you should try a little
   harder with your post. Just posting a talking point doesn't cut it.

   Gloria Borger on CNN was interviewing someone from the Romney campaign.
   I only caught
   the last part of the interview and the surrogate for Romney was asked
   about
   Romney's record in Massachusetts. He said that Romney created over
   thirty
   thousand jobs and that was more than President Obama did in his three
   plus years
   in office. Then he said that we are still losing jobs and it is worse
   than when
   Obama came into office. Both are lies. The bad part is that Gloria
   didn't call
   him on it.
   Romney lies about Obama all the time. He says that he is always
   apologizing for America. That is a lie! He stands on the stump and
   states that
   the employment was bad when Obama took office and Obama made it worse.
   That is a
   lie. He even has the nerve to say that he takes credit for the auto
   industry
   getting back on track. another lie!
   When he is asked about anything, he
   doesn't answer the question. Instead he starts telling lies about how
   Obama did
   it wrong. He never answered anything all through the debates. He is
   like a
   cheating spouse that in fear of getting caught will start accusing the
   mate of
   something to throw up a smoke screen to throw them off of the situation
   at
   hand.
   While writing this John king was interviewing Rick Perry. He told a lie
   and wasn't called on it. It is at the least poor journalism to let the
   Republicans lie about things and not being called out about them.
   Romney does it
   every time he gets in front of a microphone. He tell the same lies so
   many times
   that I think people will believe him.
   I would say to anyone that hears Mitt
   Romney talk to an audience or be in an interview to google what he
   said. You
   will find that most of the time it is not the truth.

   Ya'll ain't being force-fed enough Fox, are ya? I got a hot dose twice
   just today, once at the garage, and again in the STATE CAPITOL
   BUILDING! Yes, the state capital is pumping Fox News into the minds of
   people trapped in their long lines. Brain-washing while you wait!

   Guess what! Mitt is definitely not winning this election for Mitt, Fox
   is winning this election for Mitt. They are doing all his dirty work
   for him, while he runs a "clean" campaign or whatever.

   The whole time I was sitting within earshot of force-fed TV, Fox spewed
   a negative stream of bull sh&t about the President, accentuated with
   laughter and smug "aren't we so much better" attitudes all delivered by
   a clutch of pretty talking heads who use low cut shirts and lots of
   nicely styled hair to round out their elevated opinions. Today they
   complained that Obama busted on Bain even as one of his own advisers
   was a hedge fund manager, asking why Obama is making a case over what
   Mitt did for a living when someone in his own circle does the same
   thing. This is an effort to exonerate Bain for those Republicans who
   might not vote for a guy who's been at least partially responsible for
   mass lay-offs. "Obama did it too!"...well, his adviser did and that is
   enough to convict the President of hypocrisy while NOT convicting Mitt
   of being a dirtbag.

   Thus Fox "solves" another Mitt problem for him...

   F*%$ everyone who uses Christy Romer's highly speculative graphical
   projection of unemployment to claim that Obama promised unemployment
   below 8%. It was a projection, not a promise, hastily made based on
   incomplete information that proved to grossly underestimate the
   severity of the economic problems. Everyone except nutbag Austrians and
   Paultard goldbugs agrees that the fiscal stimulus had at least some
   positive effect, which means the error must have been in the severity
   of the underlying condition.

   A lot of politicians both Dems and Reps need to get their heads out of
   their hands.The

   American people should know that both parties profited from the
   lobbyists that promoted the Bush agenda in this country.

   Politicians in general sold out this country and the American working
   people.

   Are you afraid that the lobbyists will tell the people how you
   profited? How your vote was bought and for how much?

   Democrats are hiding behind shallow nothing policies and closed door
   meetings. While the GOP are trying to skip stones across the muddy
   flood waters of their failed policies during the Bush years.

   Mitt Romney is a glorified front man. A puppet being used by the top 1%
   to guarantee that their fortunes and influence around the world keeps
   growing.

   In 1990, George H W Bush said (this may be a paraphrase, I don't
   remember the exact words) "I chose Dan Quayle for VP because he looks
   like Robert Redford and I thought the women would vote for him." This
   is ridiculous on so many levels I don't know where to begin except to
   remind this generation where these stupid ideas come from. 1) Women
   don't vote with their glands but apparently the Bush men do. 2) Why do
   you think you're having a problem with women voters anyway? Could it be
   that 3) You and your son have encouraged ignorance throughout your
   moments of power? Attacking teacher's unions is one way. Privatizing
   schools is another. Do you understand that President Obama knows better
   than to do that? About a month ago, when he spoke at a college, someone
   yelled "I love you" and without missing a beat he called out "I love
   you back". Women would turn themselves inside out for a man who can do
   that because of his heart, not his face.
