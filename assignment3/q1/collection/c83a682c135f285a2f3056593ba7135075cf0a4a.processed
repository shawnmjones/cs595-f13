       in Geneva
     * Video shows Syrian children bleeding in a filthy makeshift clinic

   (CNN) -- On the same day peace delegates met at the United Nations in
   Switzerland on Monday to talk again about how they want calm to come to
   Syria, European Union nations agreed Monday to end an arms embargo
   against Syrian rebels, Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague said.

   "It was a difficult decision for some countries, but it was necessary
   and right to reinforce international efforts to reach a diplomatic
   solution to the conflict in Syria," he said in a written statement.

   The violence continued in the war-torn nation as bloody children were
   rushed into a dirty makeshift clinic in the Syrian city of Qusayr.

   Qusayr, near the border with Lebanon, is a strategic area where food,
   medicine and other supplies are hustled along routes used by government
   fighters and those trying to oust the government.

   Al-Assad: I'll consider talks, but ...

   CNN talked via Skype on Monday with a citizen journalist who described
   a desperate and horrid situation. The main hospital in Qusayr has been
   obliterated by fighting, the source said, not wishing to be named out
   of concern for security. The wounded are being crammed into homes. And,
   [43]as one YouTube video shows, they apparently being treated at a
   makeshift clinic.

   CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video. It's hard to watch. A
   boy wearing a purple shirt comes in screaming, his head bloody. The
   camera closes in on a baby. The child wails as people holding a steel
   instrument trying to dislodge something from the child's ear. The walls
   are smeared with blood.

   Catherine Ashton, EU High representative, announced the end of the
   embargo, reading a declaration from the organization's Foreign Affairs
   Council.

   Part of it states: "With regard to the possible export of arms to
   Syria, the Council took note of the commitment by Member States to
   proceed in their national policies as follows: The sale, supply,
   transfer or export of military equipment or of equipment which might be
   used for internal repression will be for the Syrian National Coalition
   for Opposition and Revolutionary Forces and intended for the protection
   of civilians."

   In Geneva, the United Nations' human rights commissioner spoke as she
   has several times before during the two-year war in Syria.

   Navi Pillay, in opening remarks at the first session of the U.N. Human
   Rights Council's three-week conference, said the situation has
   deteriorated to an "intolerable affront to the human conscience," and
   the International Criminal Court must mete out justice to those who've
   violated the rights of Syrians.

   "I feel utter dismay," she said.

   Pillay reminded listeners that the war in Syria began in March 2011 as
   a peaceful demonstration against President Bashar al-Assad and has
   devolved into a complicated bloodbath of sect battles and terrorist
   fighters.

   "Whenever their governments cannot or will not protect them, frightened
   human beings are dependent on the international community for
   protection and assistance," she said. "We cannot -- we must not --
   continue to ignore their plea."

   Violence surges in strategic Syrian city

   Amid the backdrop of the Geneva conference came word that [45]Sen. John
   McCain was inside Syria on Monday and met with rebels, making him the
   highest ranking U.S. official to visit during the war. The senator's
   communications director, Brian Rogers, confirmed the trip.

   Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director for the Washington-based Syrian
   Emergency Task Force, said McCain met with 18 commanders of the Free
   Syrian Army about 1 kilometer from the border with Turkey in northern
   Syria.

   "Their main message was that we are desperate for ammunition, we are
   desperate for weapons," Moustafa said. "They are confident that if the
   weapons are given to the supreme military council, that it will not
   fall in the wrong hands."

   McCain met with the commanders, which included the top leader of the
   rebel force, for about an hour.

   It's often difficult to discern exactly what is happening Syria because
   al-Assad has made it difficult if not deadly for foreign journalists to
   enter the nation. A state TV reporter, Yara Abbas, was killed in Qusayr
   on Monday, according to Syria state television. She died after
   "terrorists targeted" a state TV crew near al-Dabaa airport north of
   the strategic city near Lebanon, where rebels and government forces run
   supply routes.

   In Geneva, Pillay talked about Qusayr.

   "I am extremely concerned at current reports suggesting that hundreds
   of civilians have been killed or injured, and thousands may remain
   trapped, by indiscriminate shelling and aerial attacks by government
   forces in Al Qusayr," Pillay said. Safe passage must be given to any
   civilians wishing to leave."

   Outside reports indicate rebels continue to fight for the cause that
   began the unrest: ousting al-Assad and allowing Syrians greater
   freedom, something akin to the goals of the wider Arab Spring movement.

   Those who want al-Assad gone claim that the president has ordered his
   forces to slay families and indiscriminately shell neighborhoods across
   the country, which is about the size of Washington state.

   Al-Assad says his forces are trying to save the country from
   "terrorists."

   "These war crimes and crimes against humanity cannot be allowed to go
   unpunished," Pillay told delegates from around the world. "We must make
   it clear to both (the Assad government) and the armed opposition groups
   that there will be consequences for those responsible. And the world
   must take action to end this terrible conflict."

   Pillay's remarks came as U.S. Secretary John Kerry met in Paris with
   Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

   The two diplomats spoke briefly to reporters Monday before heading off
   to a private dinner with the French foreign minister.

   Kerry expressed concern about any possible use of chemical weapons and
   the need to determine what is happening on the ground, while Lavrov
   stressed the situation in Syria isn't getting any better and that he
   wants to do everything in his power to stop the bloodshed.

   For months during the Syrian war, Russia appeared to be supporting
   al-Assad.

   But that tide may be turning, at least gaining some wiggle room for the
   Russians to help broker an end to the violence.

   rebels

   U.S. officials want to start talks between the government and groups
   that want al-Assad gone.

   But not everyone involved in Syria wants to engage. The Syrian National
   Council, based in Istanbul, is part of the main opposition umbrella
   group and is considered to be composed of hardliners who've said
   they'll never talk or negotiate with anyone representing the Assad
   regime.

   The group was having meetings over the weekend in Istanbul to consider
   attending the Geneva conference.

   Syrian National Coalition spokesman [47]Louay Safi said the group wants
   to hear "more clarity about the purpose and the intentions of the
   Syrian regime.

   "So far," he said, "the signals have been not positive."

   [48]At the start of May, the U.N.'s point man on Syria, Lakhdar
   Brahimi, called Lavrov and Kerry's cooperation to forge a solution to
   the Syrian conflict "the first hopeful news concerning that unhappy
   country in a very long time."

   [49]Lavrov told Foreign Policy recently that the United States and
   Russia have a lot in common. Asked about his "famously contentious
   relationship" with Bush administration Secretary of State Condoleezza
   Rice, Lavrov laughed.

   "Well, I don't engage in comparing my partners," he said. "John Kerry
   is a professional. He is pragmatic. And this is a very important
   quality for a diplomat and especially for a secretary of state.

   "He has very good knowledge of things around the world. He has keen
   interest in moving some of the old problems out of the deadlock."

   Lavrov also was asked about Kerry's criticism that Russia is still
   selling weapons to Syria.

   "Well, you know on the arms sales, we never, we never tried to hide
   that we are implementing the contracts which have been signed quite
   some time ago, long before all this started," he answered, saying his
   country has provided Syria with defensive weapons.

   "We have been consistent," he told Foreign Policy. "We have been saying
   that for us priority No. 1 is to stop the bloodshed and to save lives,
   and therefore cessation of hostilities and dialogue without any
   preconditions is the best way to achieve this desired goal."

   While diplomats talked, on Monday at least 35 people were killed in
   Syria, including two women and two children, according to the
   opposition group Local Coordination Committees in Syria.
