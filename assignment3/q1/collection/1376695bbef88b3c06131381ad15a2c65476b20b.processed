One Year Ago Today
The Japanese Earthquake And Tsunami Brought a Mighty Nation To Its Knees But
Let The World Also See The Best Of Japanese Determination And Spirit

   [12]Image of One Year Ago Today
   March 11, 2012 [13]The Japan Tsunami: Gaman [14]Gaman [15]George Takei
   by George Takei

   At 2:46pm Tokyo Time, on March 11, 2011, a 9.0 earthquake struck off
   the coast of Japan, resulting in a massive tsunami that struck fishing
   towns and cities, leaving over 16,000 dead and another 3,000 still
   missing and unaccounted for.  As when tragedy struck America on 9/11,
   many of the dead and missing were firefighters and rescue workers
   trying to do their job in the midst of calamity.

   The world responded, and we all did what we could, even as we watched
   in horror as footage of the massive wave and its carnage reached us all
   quickly with the new speed and penetration of social media. As an actor
   with ethnic and familial ties to Japan, I joined the international call
   for aid, for as Hurricane Katrina taught us, even prosperous and strong
   nations need the world's help when tragedy of such magnitude strikes.
   Through a concerted twitter campaign for text donations, to which I
   added my own hashtag #TodayWeAreAllJapanese, we were able collectively
   to raise millions of dollars for the people of Japan.

   Japan continues to feel the effects of that terrible day, with fears of
   irradiated food still haunting Japanese markets from the meltdown of
   three of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors-leaving a lesson that other
   nations have taken to heart, that no nuclear facility can be completely
   safe when pitted against the devastating power of nature. Debris from
   the tsumani may begin to wash up on the shores of California, a grim
   reminder of how connected our destinies are.

   In their resolve to rebuild, the Japanese have set a high bar for the
   world.  In the wake of the tragedy, there was no looting, no violence,
   and a strong sense of order and selflessness.  Elderly Japanese
   volunteered to help with the gritty task of nuclear clean-up, offering
   up their shorter expected life spans for the greater good. It is moving
   to me to see such human spirit, after so much was lost for so many.

as Sam Kimura

   February 18, 2011 [82]That blog is so Takei!

   SAM KIMURA is an elderly veteran and war hero from World War II, living
   alone and hardened against the world.  He has not spoken to his family
   for over fifty years, but remains haunted by a longing for things lost
   decades ago.  Sam stands with the "old guard" of the Japanese American
   Citizens League, who condemned those who resisted the draft during
   World War II or showed any other sign of disloyalty to the United
   States.  But a surprise visit from a stranger, just after the events of
   9/11, rekindles memories, and Sam rediscovers things he once knew, and
   learns new inf
