Supreme Court rejects Ohio GOP's early-voting restrictions

   Associated Press

   Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R)

   After [3]losing in the lower courts, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted
   [4]announced last week that he would take his early-voting restrictions
   to the U.S. Supreme Court, hoping for a more favorable outcome.

   In a victory for voting-rights advocates and Democrats, Husted [5]lost
   at the high court, too.

     The U.S. Supreme Court sealed a legal victory for President Barack
     Obama's campaign in the pivotal state of Ohio, leaving intact a
     ruling that restored early voting rights for the weekend before the
     Nov. 6 election.

     Ohio Republicans had sought to cancel early voting that weekend for
     everyone except members of the military. A U.S. appeals court
     blocked the plan last week, saying it probably violated the
     constitutional rights of non-military voters. In a one-sentence
     order, the Supreme Court today rejected a challenge to that ruling,
     filed by Ohio's Republican secretary of state and attorney general.

   To briefly recap for those who haven't been following this story, Ohio
   had previously allowed voters an early-voting window of three days
   before Election Day, which in turn boosted turnout and alleviated long
   lines in 2008. This year, state Republican officials wanted to close
   the window -- active-duty servicemen and women could vote early, but no
   one else, not even veterans, could enjoy the same right the weekend
   before the election.

   President Obama's campaign team filed suit, asking for a level playing
   field, giving every eligible Ohio voter -- active-duty troops,
   veterans, and civilians -- equal access. Ohio Republicans kept pushing
   back, pleading with one court after another to limit voters' access.

   Today, the Supreme Court effectively ended the fight.

   Just yesterday, elections law expert [6]Rick Hasen said the outcome of
   this case had the potential to dictate the outcome of the presidential
   race in Ohio, and by extension, possibly even the nation. For
   Democrats, that makes the outcome at the U.S. Supreme Court that much
   more encouraging.

   Update: It's worth keeping in mind that there are potentially some
   fights still looming, including at local elections boards in the state.
   We also do not yet know what additional procedural steps Husted might
   take.

   Second Update: My colleague Laura Conaway, who's [7]covered this story
   closely, reminds me that Husted said last week that, in the event a
   defeat at the Supreme Court, he would set up uniform voting hours for
   each of Ohio's 88 counties. Whether he'll follow through remains to be
   seen.

   Third Update: Husted has now issued a directive setting uniform hours
   on the Saturday, Sunday, and Monday before the election, and it's
   online [8]here (pdf). In a statement, he grudgingly conceded, "Today I
   have set uniform hours statewide, giving all Ohio voters the same
   opportunities to vote in the upcoming presidential election regardless
   of what county they live in." That this is a concession the Ohio
   Secretary of State fought tirelessly not to make is rather remarkable,
   but as of this afternoon, it appears the fight is over.

   Anyone know what the hours were in 2008? My guess is that Husted looked
   at hourly turnouts then and chose the 2012 hours based on the hours
   with the lowest turnout in 2008.

   Reason Wins for One Day; Reasoning Method Applied:

   Statement: If the election is evenly matched like 50, 49, 1 then the
   whole election is like a coin toss, then that match is coin toss.

     major premise - election is evenly matched
     minor premise - election is like a coin toss
     conclusion - match is coin toss

     Instructions:
     [45]http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Syllogistic+reasoning
     syl o lo o gism (sl-jzm) n. LogicL A form of deductive reasoning
     consisting of a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion;
     for example, All humans are mortal, the major premise, I am a human,
     the minor premise, therefore, I am mortal, the conclusion.

   Exercise:

   If the election is evenly matched like 50, 49, 1 then the whole
   election is like a coin toss, then that match is coin toss.

   This could possibly suggest more than the futile outcome of elections.
   That suggestion might indicate a balanced split between ideas that are
   both firmly agreed by each side. And that those ideas must also have a
   high degree of similarity.

   Ideas that are in opposition are not likely be reconciled.
   - Opposition Ideas are firm, set and convincing in the sense that it
   takes a lot to change them. In this sense are done stick fork in them.

   Ideas that are in unanimity are not likely to be challenged.
   - Unanimity Ideas are not challenged, too much common sense, and in
   that take lot to change them. In this sense are done stick fork in
   them.

   Since it would take lot of effort to change those strongly held ideas,
   we find that those arduous efforts are displaced by the ease of a coin
   toss.

     An Americanism is something that only applies to America.

     So then what describes America that can only be American? Amerigo
     Vespucci (Italy) gave his name to the continent that he identified
     and not being Asia, his Latinized name (Americus Vespucius)
     feminized to America was placed on a 1507 map (Martin Waldseemüller
     - German) giving the new continent its name. Vespucci is this
     credited with the realization of a continent different from Asia,
     'discovered' by Columbus. Colon (Columbus) was said to be born of a
     Spanish father and Jewish servant mother, but taking an Italianized
     version of his name. So was in "America" a very typical human story,
     indeed, Spanish, Italian, German and Christian, Jewish.

     So then what describes America that can only be American? Again
     America as not a desert like Eastern World, but like the temperate
     Europe, but it was vast open land, having at best marginal native
     civilizations, devastated by contact. What was new was the vastness
     of resources unimagined by its finders, it might as well been called
     Infinitia. Such resources enabled American to nearly complete turn
     away from Europe's troubled civilizations.

     So then what describes America that can only be American? Of course
     a Frenchman, traveling in an English world, comes to name this
     Exceptional. Who educated would have thought that an undiscovered
     paradise of resources, well watered and endless would have
     influences the America Culture? Or was the impact on American
     culture already in place long before being named by itinerant author
     documenting the world's trouble.

     So in spite of my version of history, we could say that because of
     the vast American resources. There is little to no thought given to
     how these resources are used, maintained, sustained, deployed,
     bought, sold, polluted, wasted or given away. This is the
     Exceptional fact, but then it was there long before European Ideas
     moved in. The exception to the Exceptionalism is that one idea did
     make its way intact, that ideas was that property belonged to
     someone and that criticism against how the property was used has
     lost is common wealth appeal. This in turn one step removed from the
     separation of capitalism from morality distilled into greed.

   So it is safe to conclude that American have over generations failed to
   preserve those natural gifts of abundance, and have inadvertently
   chosen to ignore them. While enjoying the fruits of capitalism we
   should have been on guard against the greedy divorce separation of
   capitalism from morality.

   So the American Election is evenly divided, this is intentional,
   because the toss of a coin is one chance, a toss of billion coins is a
   rich man's gambit,

   The strength of the ideas of the opposition or the unanimity of the
   ideas of the status quo matter not a flake, except to fool as many
   voters as can be fooled.

   The bean counter concerned about the millions if not billions to spent
   in an election campaign are utterly blinded to the fact that nearly
   nickel spend on campaign advertisement and raked in by giant media
   corporations. The general public is blind to the fact that those same
   media corporations are fed gigantic advertising revenues, making them
   the largest corporations in the world, fed by even larger corporations.
   Those billion nickels march from one corporate account to another and
   are called legitimate business deductions.

   The rich man gambit is this, for every coin tossed from one hand, there
   is another hand ready to catch it. You cannot loose when you own both
   sides of the same coin.

   The election is a Joke when a (Romney) Bain Capital owned company,
   Clear Channel, can place Voter Suppression Billboards across a selected
   landscape, and Clear Channel can funnel advertisement revenues to Rush
   Limbaugh and Glen Back, and those bill boards and media advertisements
   can be paid for by those enterprising lads the Koch Brothers. This is
   American Exceptionalism at its best, when the divorce between morality
   and greed is enshrined as solely owned property right.

   We are the happy fools waiting for the greedy cow to yield milk, when
   it is a bull.

   A truly logical, though pessimistic, post...

   So, you're saying, because the Republicans own all the media and the
   Super-PACs, the Super-PACs spend all their money on advertisements in
   the media, and all the media's profits go to the Republicans, the
   Republicans can give all they want to to the Super-PACs, right?

   But, I own my vote, and I decide where it goes... One reason I might
   not use that vote, is if someone, (like you), tells me the whole system
   is rigged and my voting won't matter anyway, so why bother?

   Major Premise : Trolls try to discourage Democrats from voting...

   Minor Premise : You are trying to discourage me, a Democrat, from
   voting...

   Conclusion : You are a troll...

   There. See? Anybody can play that game...

   The Supreme Court let the ruling stand because the case has the
   potential to reopen the issue of voting rights and race. Getting
   involved with the case would have added another black eye to the court
   with Bush v. Gore and Citizens United. I don't think Roberts is that
   dumb to make another blatant partisan ruling. That is why he steered
   clear of the Obamacare case and left it to Congress to repeal it. But
   that looks highly improbable the closer we get to the elections.

   No, I am aware of the tatics of Carl Rove, and the Koch bros. They are
   getting out the cheat sheets in all of the Swing States.

   The argument used is that the GOP believes that there was Voter Fraud
   during the early voting. Even though, there are no real cases on file.

   Here is what will most likely happen in Ohio: There will be a shortage
   of the Electronic cheat machines in the Democratic counties, as well as
   the inner - city polling places. That you can count on.

   They will have Voter Challengers present there as well. You can bank on
   that.

   And, there is even an outside chance that Mr Husted will call upon the
   Governor, (Kasick), to at the very least, have the Police present since
   all of this has created a storm among the Democrats, Minorities
   (including women) voters.

   I wouldn't be at all surprised if they call out the Ohio National Guard
   to oversee the whole process.

   You know, with all the $$$$$ spent on trying to suppress the vote,
   buying and showing all the campaign ads, Billboards and 30 second
   soundbyte clips, it would have been cheaper for the Republicans to just
   pay their fair share of taxes and call it a day!!!!

   It is not at all unusual for the Supreme Court to accept decisions made

   The Supreme Court knows that these voter restrictions are so
   Unconstitutional. They understand that the "Gross Odd People" (GOP),

   wonders what Dr. King would say today? The great Dr. King would ask the
   following questions. Why is America still debating this God given right
   to vote for every citizen? Was all we did to get the Voting Rights Act
   Of 1965 passed in vain? Why are rascists allowed to participate in the
   Presidential Campaign of the GOP/RNC? Why are the men who tried to kill

   The "Cheating Machine" that has been built by the GOP in Ohio only has
   a setback. I am sure that come Election Day, you will see things like
   in 2004, from the playbook that was used then to get "W" (re elected?),
   when his poll numbers were the lowest since Richard (I'm Not A Crook)
   Nixon was in office.
   This is where Early Voting will be even more important than before. I
   plan to early note tomorrow. I want to see first if Obama and the Dems
   have a backbone or not. I want to make sure if they will allow Willard
   Romney to spout one Lie after another Lie and get away with it or not.

   I just have a rough time believing that "We, The People" can allow
   someone to run for the highest office in the land, and get away with
   flip-flopping and down right LYING to the American people.
   You, as well as I want to know just whom the real Willard Romney is? I
   can say I have seen the real candidate. In the "47%" video, the real
   candidate in the video making fun of Latinos, the real candidate lying
   on stage about being in business for over 20 years and NEVER hearing
   about sending American jobs to China. LIER, LIER, LIER!!!!!
   THAT IS THE REAL ROMNEY!!!!!!
   As you read this now, half the town of Freeport Illinois is panic
   stricken because of Willard Romney closing their plant down and sending
   the jobs overseas to China to save money by having what amounts to
   SLAVE LABOUR! This is worse than the war crimes committed last decade.
   I just can't believe this race to the White house is this even. WTF???
   Who in good conscience would even think about voting for this P.O.S.
   that the Republican party has put up?

   It's time to wake up people and see the seriousness of this election!

   The original reason was due to costs. Too expensive to do. I live in
   Cuyahoga County and they said not a problem and it mushroomed from
   there.

   Too bad Husted didn't take all the taxpayer dollars he spent on
   fighting early voting and just spend it on, you know, early voting!

   Interesting how it wasn't too expensive in all the previous elections
   where early voting was allowed, including this year's Republican
   primary.

   I have the same question as Tom. What were the GOP lawyers arguing in
   court? We know why they were really doing it, but how did actually
   frame their argument(s)?

   What did this whole brouhaha cost the State of Ohio (read "taxpayers in
   Ohio")? Does anyone have a clue?

   It is hard to think about the debate tonight when my fellow citizens
   are hurting so very badly in Freeport Illinois. The GOP/RNC "Speculator
   and Chief" is going to make $8 Million Dollars in 'blood money' by
   sending these American Jobs right to China. What is very frustrating!
   Is to know that Chinese Nationals are training for American Jobs on US
   soil, and that a Chinese Flag was flying over an American Plant. Now
   the Chinese Flag is down America however, the "Economic Evil" of this
   Bain Capital 'Speculation' is on the rise!
