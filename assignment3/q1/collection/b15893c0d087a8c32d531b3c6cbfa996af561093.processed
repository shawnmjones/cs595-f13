[24]Obama administration can't stop sequester cancer cuts

   Cancer Center sign
   The Obama administration [30]can't do anything about the sequester cuts
   to cancer treatment for Medicare patients, the Centers for Medicare and
   Medicaid Services reiterated to Congress. Health and Human Services
   Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had [31]already told Congress that, but
   hope--and the desire to pretend unpopular cuts are the president's
   fault--springs eternal among congressional Republicans.

   "We do not believe that we have the authority under the Budget Control
   Act of 2011 to exempt Medicare payment for Part B drugs," acting CMS
   administrator Marilyn Tavenner [32]wrote, noting that the budgeting
   flexibility the Health and Human Services Department retains "is
   separate from the agency's administration of Medicare payments, which
   are subject to the sequestration reductions."

   Now Congress has to decide. Does it keep this damaging, outrageous cut
   in place because DEFICIT DEFICIT DEFICIT, or does it once again chip
   away at the indiscriminate, across-the-board sequester cuts that
   Republicans thought were such a great idea and should definitely be put
   in place rather than closing some corporate tax loopholes? Keep having
   elderly cancer patients turned away from clinics, or implicitly admit
   that there were problems with this whole plan to begin with? While
   clearly elderly cancer patients rank above Head Start kids on the
   Republican priority list, now we're going to see if they're up there
   with the business travelers Congress swiftly protected from
   sequester-related travel delays.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   is the wrong question.

   Talk about chipping away, or flexibility to reallocate, is tantamount

   We should be shouting from the rooftops that the sequester is as stupid

   be REPEALED UNCONDITIONALLY.

       Republicans don't pass a budget without the sequester, there's
       nothing Reid can do to pass one on his own, filibuster or not.
       However, he could do away with the filibuster and get the nominee's
       off the agenda so they could deal with what really matters to
       America - jobs and now, hopefully, some oversight for Merkeley and

   HHS can interpret regulations anyway that they'd like to.  So, I don't
   buy Sebelius' statement.

     "Repeal' the entire package--which the Administration opposes.

     Do NOT replace the sequester with a Grand Bargain--which the
     Administration supports, because it cuts Social Security and
     Medicare.

   Once they kill off enough people, there will be no need to provide

   In consequence, the debt will drop, and there will be plenty of money

   Why not claim you have the authority, don't make the cuts and dare
   someone to try and stop you?  If no one argues, cancer patients get

       That's on both parties. Repeal the sequester, now.

   of those old people.  Bad planning, getting cancer when they were poor.
    If they'd just been smarter about things, they wouldn't be lining up
   now to get treatment that we can't afford to offer when we have much
   higher priorities, like subsidies to oil companies, and tax loopholes
   for billionaires, and military equipment for local police forces to use
   against students.

   Sounds like this sequester business is working just fine in the GOP
   world.  Teach those lazy moochers a lesson.  Right?

 If Medicare patients can reasonably go ([290]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   to a hospital cancer center, they should.  The quality of care is much
   better there.  The private, for profit cancer clinics aren't the best
   option when others are available. Obviously, its not an option for
   people living in remote areas where cancer hospitals are farther away.

   While the sequester cuts are destructive and need to be addressed,
   private, for profit cancer clinics (actually storefront-type
   operations) are being somewhat unreasonable in turning patients away
   because of the cuts in administrative expense reimbursement.  The
   actual cut is from 6% to 4.3% of the cost of the cancer drug, which can
   be quite high, from $5,000 to $10,000 a month, per patient.

   These cancer clinics receive full administrative reimbursement from
   private health insurance companies.  They also have a profit margin
   built into the treatments themselves.

   Doctors who own these clinics choose to do so because they make many
   times more money delivering cancer drugs in their clinic than doing so
   in a hospital environment. In my 10+ years of counseling cancer
   patients, I know that most of them will not treat Medicaid or uninsured
   patients, unless they pay cash in advance.

   Many cancer patients are the victims, they're trapped in the middle.
   Those who have the option (like the thousands turned away on Long
   Island) can go for treatment to their local hospitals.  The hospital
   may not have the fancy waiting rooms with chic decor and indoor gardens
   w/waterfalls, but they're as good or better than the clinic.

   "If you can't take their money, eat their food, drink their booze and
   then vote against them, you have no business being in DC."
