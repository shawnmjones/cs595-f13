   [28]8 restaurant surcharges that don't make sense - and 8 that do

   [29]Details.com editor James Oliver Cury tackles controversial
   food-and-drink-themed [30]etiquette issues.

   Which industry has the most egregious surcharges? Airlines have added
   some surprisingly sneaky fees over the years and were recently in the
   news again for [31]considering charging extra for overweight people.
   One airline, Ryanair, seems to take pride in its fees and even
   contemplated adding [32]a cost to use the bathroom. Not that hotels
   have been kind; $8 water bottles and $40 parking spots are as common as
   charging for Wi-Fi. But restaurants and bars, in my estimation, have
   developed the most crafty ways to squeeze profit out of that which was
   once - and should still be - gratis.

   I made a list of every âextraâ charge Iâve ever heard of (16 examples
   came to mind and Iâm sure there are more) and separated them into two
   categories: those that seem warranted (like charging for shaved
   truffles on an entrÃ©e) and those that seem brazenly unnecessary and
   unfair (like charging extra for ketchup).

   Below is my definitive list of potential offenses with reasoned
   assessments of the fairness quotient of each, based purely on personal
   opinion.
   Extra Charges I Just Don't Get

   Steak sauce/butters
   The first time I ate at [33]Dylan Prime Steakhouse in New York I was
   floored to see that a meal - which could easily cost more than $100 a
   person - might also include a $3 extra charge for a sauce or special
   butter. Thatâs like charging extra for sprinkling Parmesan on your
   pizza. Or having salt on the table. The eatery has seen troubled times
   recently so thereâs no telling if the menu will retain the practice.

   Ketchup
   Yes, some fast food joints charge extra for a packet of ketchup. I came
   face to face with this practice at a McDonaldâs in London back in 1988.
   The cost: 5p (pence) - about a nickel - per packet. The idea has since
   crossed the pond, where U.S. franchise owners decide [34]how theyâll
   dole out condiments (in [35]packets, via spigots with paper containers,
   for a fee or not.). The current cost stateside seems to be 25 cents for
   a handful of packets. And though it might cut down on waste, it seems
   random; why arenât there similar surcharges for mustard and mayo?

   Splitting a dish/extra side dish
   If an entrÃ©e costs $15 and you use your fork to give your spouse
   several bites, no one charges you extra. Ask if you can officially
   split the dish and you may get hit with a surcharge of between $2 and
   $5 or more, a penalty that feels like itâs designed to discourage
   sharing (which is weird because donât we go to restaurants to share a
   meal with others?) That said, if the request requires time and effort
   from a server to literally divide the dish and garnishes, then a
   separate fee seems warranted. If just a side plate is requested, it
   ought to be free (please donât suggest that the effort of washing the
   extra plate necessitates the fee).

   Splitting the check
   I was a waiter once. I know it takes more time to process two, three,
   even four credit cards. But thereâs no [36]good reason to charge extra
   - [37]or forbid - the practice. Credit-card processing fees should not
   be the customersâ concern.

   Cocktail neat/on the rocks
   Some bars tack on an extra buck or two claiming that the pour is
   different: You get 2 ounces in a neat rocks glass and 1.5 ounces if you
   order on the rocks. Or vice versa, depending on the place (see [38]this
   description of a recent bourbon order). Canât the bartender find some
   glasses that render these pouring differences less marked or just suck
   up the differenceâ¦or figure it all evens out eventually anyway? Or
   just charge more in general for the cocktail? Why complicate things?

   Food waste/not finishing what's on the plate
   Buffets are magnets for gluttons because you can pile on as much food
   as the plate will hold - and sometimes come back for seconds. But
   thereâs a cost: Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs and tons of food
   typically remains on the plate at the end of the meal. To combat this
   effect, some restaurants have suggested applying a fee, as reported
   about the [39]$32 waste fee posted by the management at The Kylin
   Buffet Chinese restaurant in England. A noble idea, perhaps, but
   restaurants are not government institutions (âTake all you want but eat
   all you takeâ as they say in the army), and honestly, there are a
   million reasons why someone wouldnât finish every morsel. Someone wants
   to monetize this? See also Hachikyo, [40]a seafood restaurant in Japan
   that requires customers who do not finish their bowl of tsukko meshi
   (rice topped with salmon roe) to make a donation.

   Non-bottled (sometimes filtered) tap water
   Millennium restaurant in San Francisco had its heart in the right
   place: They were dedicated to organic food production, small farms,
   sustainable agriculture, recycling and composting. In fact, they were
   so environmentally-friendly that they took the extreme measure of
   banning bottled water altogether, offering instead [41]a delicious
   glass from their Natural Tap Water Filtration System. Unfortunately,
   they also stopped offering tap water. So, water cost $1 for whatâs
   basically filtered tap water. Bobo, in New York, was also taken to task
   for [42]what is effectively water gouging with a conscience. Even [43]a
   few McDonaldâs (them again?) got in on the action. I say: Allow the
   public to have a free glass of water, if only so boozers can work in a
   little hydration without penalty.

   Sliced bagels
   In New York thereâs an [44]8% tax on âalteredâ bagels: Sliced, toasted
   or served with schmear. Why the distinction? The cutting and spreading,
   though a minimal culinary effort to be sure, technically makes it a
   prepared meal. Sold unaltered, it is a tax-exempt food item. Seems like
   thereâs a hole in this law to me.

   Extra Charges I Understand

   Gourmet ingredients
   You want freshly shaved black truffles on your butter-poached lobster?
   Thatâll be an additional $12 at [45]Michaelâs on the Hill in Vermont
   (fair price it seems to me). Caviar on the side? Of course you gotta
   pay extra for that. Nothing fishy there. These are gourmet ingredients,
   so unless the menu hides the fact that thereâs a surcharge, these are
   warranted. (Years ago, I once ordered a âspecialâ soup at a Chinese
   restaurant - I donât recall if it was turtle or sharkfin, neither of
   which Iâd order today - and the server neglected to mention that it
   cost $40. Iâve been wary of unfamiliar delicacies ever since.)

   Bread and butter/chips and salsa
   Historically, Americans in the latter part of the 20th century are
   accustomed to seeing certain side dishes served for free before a meal.
   Most consumers simply wonât go back to an establishment if theyâre
   charged for something they used to get (or can get elsewhere) for free.
   But really, why are these dishes free? The ingredients cost money - and
   they fill you up, so you may order less. And yet it caused quite a stir
   when the Post reported that [46]Chelsea restaurant Company charged â$3
   for bread and another $2 for butterâ a few years back. To be
   contrarian, The New York Timesâ [47]Frank Bruni argued for the extra
   fees. Personally, I wouldnât choose to go back to a place that charged
   me for bread, but that doesnât mean I canât see the argument for this
   policy.

   No-shows
   You made a reservation, the restaurant is holding your table, and you
   never show up and donât even call? Seems fair to charge a penalty so
   selfish barbarians donât abuse the privilege, especially in cities like
   New York where aggressive diners have been known to make reservations
   at three venues for the same time and day - to hold the spots - and
   only show up at one at the last minute. (Itâs easy for restaurateurs to
   charge your credit card if you book through online reservation sites).
   The Wall Street Journal chronicled the practice a year ago; rates range
   from $50 (OpenTableâs fee) to $225 (the full price of the prix fixe at
   [48]Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare).

   Certain substitutions
   I have no idea if the fries really cost more or less than a salad at
   any given restaurant, but if a dish normally comes with one side dish
   and youâd like a different one, you should be notified about the price
   difference and understand that some of the fee goes to the extra effort
   of making the chef (or server) plate something in an unfamiliar way.
   Not all menus are designed to mix and match - much to the chagrin of
   vegetarians, allergy sufferers, the lactose-intolerant and [49]gluten
   avoiders.

   Eating at prime time
   Famed New York dining institution Le Cirque once toyed with the idea of
   [50]âformalizing a prime-time price increase,â according to CBS. The
   idea is simple: Everyone wants to eat between 6 and 8 p.m. - not at
   5:30 or 10:30 p.m. Charging more for access during the dinner rush is
   not unlike nightclubs that charge more after midnight when the dance
   floor is packed and they donât need bodies to fill the space anymore.
   Frankly, Iâm surprised no one charges for premium seating (bigger
   tables, far from the bathrooms, etc.) in New York restaurants...yet.

   Tips for large groups
   You just had a steak dinner with six buddies. The bill comes and
   thereâs an extra 20% at the bottom. Does that count as an extra fee?
   No. Is it fair? Yes - as long as the gratuity does not exceed 20%.
   Admittedly there are two potential downsides to this practice: First,
   if the service sucks, youâre forced to pay this healthy tip anyway.
   Second, and far worse, some bills hide this automatically added fee,
   which leads the occasional diner to pay an unintended second tip on
   top.

   Corkage
   If youâre bringing your own wine to a restaurant and thus not paying
   for a bottle from their list (would you ever dare to bring your own
   food?), then it makes sense that management would charge an extra
   charge fee (to discourage the practice and to make up some of the lost
   revenue). Itâs the amount that can be galling. $20? Fine. [51]$75 to
   $100? Too rich for my blood. But if youâre dining at places like
   [52]Per Se or French Laundry, what do you expect? Call first and ask
   about the policy to be sure.

   Access to the room with live music
   If a band is playing, of course, itâs ok to charge extra for those
   customers who want to be closer to the music. [53]Helsinki Hudson, for
   example, requires separate reservations depending on whether youâre
   eating at the restaurant or inside the club - even though both are
   under the same roof. Sometimes, though, I wish venues would pay me to
   continue to endure listening.

       Millenium restaurant no longer charges $1 for water, the article
       you sited was from 2009.
       "In a concerted effort to reduce recycling waste, combat high fuel
       charges & offer our guests an uncompromisingly high quality of
       drinking water, we now serve water through a Natura Tap Water
       Filtration System and no longer offer imported bottled mineral

       This link is a NY TImes story about hotels adding numerous fees for
       travelers. When I travel for business, I prefer to have the charges
       added in- internet particularly. Some hotels charge for this but
       provide it free for "members" as an incentive to have you in their
       database. I am including this as a parallel to the discussion. It
       is a revenue opportunity for the hotels who say the rate would be
       higher if they were to include everything- this way, the guest
       chooses what services they wish to purchase. Maybe, but - what
       next? Charging for the pillow? The beverage straw? Coaster?

       As long as customers continue to pay these ridiculous inflated fees
       I am sure restaurants will continue to charge them. The only way
       customers are going to get rid of them is to refuse to pay them and
       tell the restaurants that as long as they charge these fees that
       they have lost your business. If enough of us do this, only then
       will they quit charging them.

       If a surcharge is clearly posted in advance, I have no problem with
       it being charged. I can decide whether to accept the charge by my
       choice of place to eat.

       I totally agree with restaurants charging for no shows. If I am
       unable to make a reservation I call to cancel. They always seem to
       be really happy that I called so they did not hold the table.

            How much would they charge? How would a person not be able to
            dispute the charge on the CC?
            Better to blacklist the person if they don't call. They can't
            place a reservation again.

       Are you kidding? A 20% hike for a table of 6? That's daylight
       robbery and cannot be justified in any rational manner. It is more
       beneficial and cost-effective for the restaurant to have 6 diners
       at once than 6 individuals. Nobody is charged 20% extra for buying
       6 beers/loaves/tomatoes/cars or whatever at one time.

            If the service is poor enough, nearly all restaurants will
            remove the autograt if you complain.
            Then again, if you're b!tching because you're stingy, that's
            another matter...

       I certainly understand a split plate fee when the dish is divided
       and plated in the kitchen, but charging for a small dish so I can
       hand someone at the same table a taste of my food? Would they
       prefer I just use my bread plate?
       I was with workmates at an upscale asian bistro in LA, and someone
       asked about my tom yum shrimp soup. She had never even heard of it,
       and thought the ingredients sounded strange but intriguing. I asked
       the server for a small cup so I could give her a taste. No, I
       wasn't going to just spoon some into her mouth or pass my bowl to
       her - there were three people seated between us and I didn't know
       her well enough to share utensils. She liked it so much that she
       ordered a bowl for herself. We had already paid the bill before we
       noticed that there was a $2 charge for the extra sharing dish.
       Really? They didn't loose a dime on this split; the extra cup
       resulted in an additional full-sized bowl being ordered. We were
       annoyed, but not enough to complain.

            Silly stuff like that comes out of any tip I leave.
            As the waiter/waitress didn't have enough common sense to
            remove it when they got the extra sale, that's completely on
            them.

       I think that your wrong when you said that the business should pay
       the credit card fees. I think that it should be an extra fee if I
       want to use my credit card. Most businesses just add that into the
       plate cost. What about the person that pays with cash. It is a
       convenience for me to use a card instead of cash.

            They can charge an extra fee if it is clearly posted and the

       This is really sloppy journalism and seems more like cranky
       editorializing. There are too many mistakes to point out, but not
       understanding the tax code in NYC is a good start. UN-manipulated
       food (e.g. a loaf of bread, a bagel) is a grocery item and is not
       taxed. Once its been altered, its a restaurant item. Its pretty
       simple.
       There are plenty of interesting, provocative pieces you could write
       about the restaurant business. This is not one of them.

            So, 6 sliced bagels from Panera gets more tax than 6 sliced
            bagels in the grocery store's bread aisle. Does this apply to
            a loaf of bread, too? What about bakeries, am I being taxed by
            the state if they slice my rye bread? When did greed and

       You should come to eat in Italy. There's a 1 or 2 euro service
       charge per person and waitresses are paid a salary so tipping is
       not expected. You can split dishes in restaurants and no one will
       think you're one step up from homeless. Bread is included in the
       service charge. Lots of places will actually round down your bill,
       rather than up. Lots of places will give you a free drink at the
       end of your meal if you're friendly.

            Ha! We juste returned from a month in Europe with 2 weeks of
            Italy. I was somewhat pi$$ed with that place. We were charged
            2 euros per person at some restaurant. We didn't know there
            was such charge nor was it written anywhere until we got the
            bill... then the waiter showed showed it to us - it was
            written in Italian in fineprint on the menu. Then he said
            "This is normal for every restaurant in Italy".... it was our
            first time since we had been in Italy (almost 2 weeks). Then
            in Rome, another restaurant charged us also 2 euros per person
            but it included two entrÃ©es and a glass of sparkling wine
            each. BEWARE IN VENICE: a coffee in Place St-Marc will cost
            you 35 euros and you are billed in advance. Sitting down at a
            table in Place St-Marc will cost you 15 euros per person as
            "cover charge". Also in Venice, they will refuse that you
            split a pizza or eat a pizza on the street (because on the
            street, the view is nicer than inside therefore they keep the
            nice tables for people who spend more). We had 4 drinks (a
            beer, a strawberry diquiry, a fresh orange juice and a lemon
            slushy) in Sorrento and the bill was 25.50 Euros.

                 The 'coperto' IS in every restaurant/trattoria/pizzeria
                 in Italy! Not sure how you missed that. Piazza San Marco
                 is the most expensive piazza in Italy and, yeah, Venice
                 is the most beautiful, amazing but rip-off tourist trap I
                 know about. Never been to Sorrento but you got stiffed
                 there too. Sorry, man, hope it didn't put you off Italy
                 for good.
                 A pizza and a beer for two where I live in Genoa would
                 cost you from $20-$40 depending on the pizza. 10 years
                 ago it would've been around $12-15. Times change. Peace.

       "...you should be notified about the price difference and
       understand that some of the fee goes to the extra effort of making
       the chef (or server) plate something in an unfamiliar way."
       The author of this article is woefully ignorant to how restaurants
       operate. The idea that the charge goes into a cook or waiter's
       pocket shows that this individual either never worked in a

            Dave could not agree more. I feel dumber for reading this
            article, but fortunately I have enough common sense to
            disregard this gibberish. The writer sounds like a fresh
            college grad who just swallowed a big pill, i.e. he took a
            date to a big city dinner and "golly that's expensive." The
            writer, being used to ordering from a cashier and paying
            before his meal, is like a new born deer trying to walk on
            ice. Out of his element, he fights his confused fears with a
            keyboard.

            ... or, you fail at reading comprehension. The author is in no
            way saying that the extra fee actually goes into the chef's
            pocket. He's merely saying that since it requires extra effort
            *by* the chef, the restaurant is justified in charging an
            extra fee.

               o Paul
                 The fee is not charge because of the extra two seconds of
                 plating. Its charged because a table has a dollar value
                 attached to it. At a non churn and burn style restaurant,
                 each table is expensive real estate. If you are too cheap
                 to order something with out the surcharge you are costing
                 the restaurant money by occupying that space. The charge
                 recoups a partial amount of the loss with the charge. If
                 patrons do not like it and choose not to come back, the
                 charge is killing two birds with one stone.
                 Its not a reading comprehension issue for me, its the
                 writer's lack of common sense on why a charge may be
                 applied.

                      What you said is true about why the fee exists, but

                 by saying that I "fail at reading comprehension," because
                 you have a different point-of-view, then I could retort

                      Dave, I was defending the author who you insulted by
                      calling "woefully ignorant" and/or "purposefully
                      misleading the reader". Your example was: "The idea
                      that the charge goes into a cook or waiter's
                      pocket". His exact words: "some of the fee goes to
                      the extra effort of making the chef (or server)
                      plate something in an unfamiliar way". It's a
                      stretch at best to infer from that that the author
                      believes the fee ends up in anyone's pocket other
                      than the owner. Occam's razor here: it's a slightly
                      ambiguous sentence, not a complete lack of common
                      sense or hidden agenda.
                      I'm sorry if I offended your doctorate-level
                      intelligence. Turns out we're both highly educated,
                      but in this particular instance you set the tone and
                      then cried "insulting" when it came back at you. I
                      guess you figured everyone should be civil, except
                      when insulting the author.

               o Dave
                 As I said before, you and I disagree on intent.
                 âsome of the fee goes to the extra effort of making the
                 chef (or server) plate something in an unfamiliar way."
                 Earlier in the article, he also writes, âif the request
                 requires time and effort from a server to literally
                 divide the dish and garnishes, then a separate fee seems
                 warranted.â
                 Yes, the commentary is on two different topics
                 (substitutions vs. split plates), but together in
                 context, it is not a stretch to infer that he intimates
                 that the fees for these types of occurrences are in some
                 way remitted to the parties responsible for actually
                 handling the servicing of the request.
                 No offense taken, but to suggest that because you and I
                 disagree must mean that I fail at reading comprehension
                 doesnât help your argument, and itâs sadly typical of
                 todayâs discourse.
                 By the way, ânot a complete lack of common sense,â was
                 not what I was inferring. I am not insulting him, but
                 pointing out that it does not sound like he knows what he
                 is writing about. And reading some of the other comments,
                 it appears that other readers feel the same way.

            Is the writer under 21? A rocks or a neat pour is different

            be hitting up AYCD nights at the local college dive.
            The extra plate charge makes sense too. Its not the time or
            service, its the fact that a table or booth is being under
            utilized. Restaurants operate on thin margins and the have to
            serve X customers a night to break-even. Cheap people
            splitting dishes to save money is a waste of the table and the
            servers time. I see people do it all the time, but can not
            figure out how they have reached this point of their life with
            such poor restaurant etiquette. McDonalds, Arbys,
            Chick-fila-A, etc all have dine in areas and you do not even
            have to tip. If you can not afford it, do not eat out.
            Additionally, you could save up for a special occasion and
            order like an adult.

                 Some people do split meals not because they are cheap,
                 but because they can't eat the entire portion themselves,
                 and it's better than throwing half the meal into the
                 trash can, or stuffing it down after there's no longer
                 any space or appetite for it. Yes, you could take half of
                 it home with you, but some items really do not do well
                 re-heated. That being said, I do understand why
                 restaurants charge a fee for that extra plate.

                      worth the effort to serve. They choose the cheapest
                      meal, not one they might actually enjoy, order water
                      when they really want a nice wine, are very
                      demanding of the servers time and leave them little
                      or no tip. Then they get on Yelp and complain about
                      the horrible meal they just had. I think people go
                      into just about any situation with a preconceived
                      notion as to what the experience is going to be like

                      only 4.1% of americans were on welfare . So that is
                      less than 5 out of a hundred . 38.8% of those people
                      are white ,39.8 are black 15.7, are hispanic (white,
                      black and mixed ), only 2.4 % are asian and the rest
                      are other . Also 40 states pay more to be on welfare
                      than to have an $8.00 per hour job . That is because
                      unlike minimum wage jobs welfare is designed on a
                      "living wage " . Minimum wage jobs are NOT designed

                 Sorry, but you're very incorrect. Every half ounce of
                 liquor costs a lot more than you imagine, considering
                 every expense that goes into running a restaurant/bar.
                 Especially in NYC. You're not paying for the food or
                 liquor, you're paying for the real estate. Welcome to New
                 York City.
                 Complaining about a dollar or two more for a half ounce
                 of liquor, or that Red Bull mixer, or whatever, is
                 missing the point and 9.5 times out of 10, you
                 (generalizing) take it out on the service folk.
                 If you don't like the prices and you can't afford to
                 properly tip on top of those prices, you shouldn't be

                      Pretty much. If you're worried about the extra
                      surcharges, many of which are designed to keep away
                      people who want extras but don't want to pay for it,
                      you shouldn't be there. And the plate fee is to keep
                      a table from losing money when people who don't want
                      to get two of them expensive dishes but lock up a
                      table for an hour or more.

            So true. By that logic, why not just charge the same for all
            menu items? It will work out in the end.

       I ordered a fish filet sandwich at McDonalds and asked for the
       tarter sauce on the side, because my daughter never tried it and
       wasn't sure if she would like it. The lady charged my extra (even
       though it is free with the sandwich) because of the miniscule cup
       she had to use for the sauce.

       The worst is charging to use the restroom on a flight. If one is on
       a tight budget, and already maxed out with the other ridiculous
       add-on fees for air travel, they would avoid hydration during a
       flight. And they would refrain from using the restroom when the
       call comes. Both are very unhealthy practices that could lead to
       dehydration and UTIs. Not to mention that getting up and walking to
       the restroom can help prevent blood clots from inactivity. But I
       hope the airline is able to earn a few dollars by putting health at
       risk.

            funny enough, but the airline isnt forcing you to fly
            anywhere. if you cant afford to pay the fee maybe you should
            stay home. in all likelihood you CAN afford the price of
            admission nut just dont want to pay it. thats YOUR fault, not
            the airlines.

                      the price of an airline ticket today is far lower
                      than the price was 20 or 30 years ago adjusted for
                      inflation and little higher real dollars, despite
                      huge increases in fuel cost.
                      want service? you can get great service and plenty
                      of room on an airplane. it's called first class.
                      some first class 'seats' are private cabins these
                      days with beds and your choice gourmet meal

                      todays consume wants to go to a low fair finder web

       I found one item interesting - charging for bread. Many restaurants
       do it abroad and they are missing the boat. I worked my way through
       college as a waitress and was told the secret of the bread at each
       restaurant. Money is made in a restaurant through serving drinks
       not food. Soda is pure profit and as mentioned, a glass of wine in
       a restaurant is the same cost as a bottle in a store (at 4 to 5
       servings for bottle..you do the math). So why serve bread for free?
       Because it's how a restaurant makes a profit. When you sit down you
       order a drink. You then eat the bread which is highly salted. The
       more bread you eat, the more you will drink. If you are served a
       drink when you are seated and then eat the bread, you will usually
       order one or sometimes two extra drinks BEFORE the actual meal
       arrives. That one serving of bread has netted a very large profit
       made on drinks. Food may bring customers in to a restaurant, but
       the drinks keep the establishment solvent. If a restaurant denies
       it, they are not telling you the truth.

       An interesting and thoughtful article, thank you. I've a comment on
       the corkage fee. There are very good reasons to bring in your own
       wine. Basically, the restaurant makes a huge profit on something it
       didn't make, and whose quality it can only harm by improper
       storage. Many customers know very well what taste they like with
       their food. They may have special varieties or wineries they like.
       Having a customer bring a familiar taste with them to the table is
       certain to improve the customer's perception of the food quality.
       If a customer has a sophisticated palate, the chances are good they
       have better taste than the restaurant does, or that the restaurant
       buyer has. The very best deals in a restaurant's wine are likely to
       be gone, and what's left grossly overpriced. If I was having a
       special dinner? I'd absolutely bring my own wine. It might very
       well end up being cheaper and better.

            Wine is almost always the lowest markup at restaurants. You
            may think a 4 to 1 markup sounds high, but 25% cost is ot a
            great margin running a business. t is not as if the markup is
            all profit for the restaurant. They pay rent, salaries,
            electric bill, insurance, etc. It costs money to run a
            restaurant. Their margins are actually typically very slim.
            Look how many restaurants come and go. It is a tough business.
            When you go out to a restaurant, you might get the same wine
            at a higher price, but you are not at home. You go out for the
            experiance. That experiance has value, and it is not free.

       I clicked on the article for the one about the buffet "waste
       charge". It was a story on the UK Mail website about 3 people who
       had to pay a fee at a buffet for having a little bit left on their
       plate. A bunch of British fools in the comment section were
       actually defending a chinese food buffet's $32(Â£20) waste
       surcharge, and the buffet for 3 people already cost about $30(Â£18)
       before the charge. The charge for leaving food on your plate there
       is actually more than it costs to get into the buffet! The chinese
       buffet near me costs $7 a person, that's $21 for 3 people, with no
       "waste" charge. The family of three ended up paying $60(Â£38) for
       three people at this place, compared to where I live in the US
       where it would only be $21(Â£13.5) for the same thing.
       The British people who were commenting defending this are crazy.
       They must be used to getting ripped off. Keep that idiocy on the
       other side of the pond, and speaking of British idiocy, take back

            There is an important distinction between the two restaurants.
            Any Chinese restaurant that charges $7 per person for an
            all-you-can-eat buffet is serving absolute garbage. Fast-food
            Chinese at best. It'll be soaking in sugary glazes, deep fried
            and no Cantonese authenticity. Essentially, the American
            version of Chinese food. A place that offers true Chinese
            dishes (particularly as a buffet) will charge SIGNIFICANTLY
            more than $7 and if food is wasted, they will try to
            discourage it by charging for it. Food that gets taken but not
            eaten means the kitchen staff has to work that much harder to
            keep the buffet stocked and go through that much more
            inventory for nothing.

       What so many people are failing to see is that the business is set
       up by the business' owner and they provide a service to the people
       the business' owner feels is needed. If you do not like the cost,
       the provisions, the ambiance, the people, then please save yourself
       the drama and disappointment and do not go there. This is a very
       high failure rate industry because of the varying types of
       businesses. Some last only a few short lived months and others will
       lavish us for decades, this doesn't mean they do everything for
       you. This means they attend to the guests, employees, and
       neighborhood as best they can. They try to make a difference within
       the business' owners boundaries. These boundaries should exist
       because the business owner is taking the risk of opening their
       vision, desire, hearts to you. You should appreciate the fact
       someone cared enough to try their best to provide you with what
       they felt would be the best night out you've had. And, frankly, if
       you didn't have the best night, if it bothers you so much that you
       paid $3 more for an extra plate with a slightly larger portion on
       the plate so that it may sate you, if it bothers you to pay more
       for a little stronger pour in that glass because you didn't want to
       have ice, if it bothers you to pay for a sauce that some minimum
       wage soul spent time and effort to make so that it may brighten
       that one little spot in your heart, then you have missed the point.
       People do not get into this business for the money, they do it for
       the love and enjoyment of having someone leave with a smile on
       their face.

       ordering a Caesar salad and I ask if the restaurant has anchovies,
       for some reason the staff assumes that I am asking because I don't

       So what about the restaurant that didn't have biscuits and gravy on
       the menu by itself, but did include it with a more expensive item.
       I didn't have the budget for the more expensive item so I asked the
       waitress if they had biscuits and gravy only. They did and she
       quoted me the price which wasn't out of line. Being a little bit
       hungry, I asked if I could get an extra biscuit, expecting a bump
       in the price but not specifically asking. Big mistake; when I got
       my bill, it was for two separate orders at full price for each. All
       I got was an extra biscuit under the gravy, which is all I wanted,
       but this??? The restaurant wouldn't adjust the bill, so I sent an
       email explaining (and complaining) to the franchise. I even
       complimented the restaurant service, cleanliness, and atmosphere.
       The Egg and I management never gave me the courtesy of a reply,
       much less an adjustment. I will never voluntarily patronize another
       Egg and I. I keep the bill framed on the wall to remind me, and to
       let me tell the story to whoever asks about it. If you agree that I
       was gouged, please consider going to another restaurant the next

                 The order seems to read Biscuits (note the plural) and
                 gravy. Plus one extra biscuit does not equal two orders
                 of biscuits (note the plural again) and gravy. If they
                 charge for two orders of something, they da** well better
                 bring me *two* full orders of the item or they are

            it. But having read, I think the common denominators of
            concern are lack of mutual respect, courtesy, the easy feel of
            hospitality and plain old manners. Can you tell I'm Southern?
            As a diner/consumer, I'm about half dead/broke from being
            "nickel and dimed" from about every angle/profession @ every
            angle anyone could possibly come up with to make an extra
            nickel, dime or to make ends meet. I love good food,
            appreciate good people & service & atmosphere &
            professionalism and happily show it (gratuity) when I see it.
            It's not that complicated. Restaurants are businesses and like
            all other businesses these days, I'm so tired of the drain,
            hidden and upfront fees and all.

       So to sum it up, if you're going to trendy restaurants, expect to
       be ripped off.
       Someone has to pay for the newfound sense of entitlement of waiters
       and dishwashers.

       No-shows being charged? Sure, but only after a 30-min lateness
       delay. Traffic being what it is, fair is fair.
       A fee for not finishing what's on your plate? Sure, but you must
       also allow me to pour the excess food down the owner's shirt first.

            No, sorry. No charge for a no-show. That's just part of the
            cost of a restaurant doing business. They can fill their
            tables with walk-in customers. When I make a reservation,
            that's not a contract. If I don't show, I didn't get anything,
            so I'm not paying for anything. If that hurts the restaurant,
            too bad. That's part of the business. The idea they could
            charge for such a thing is not only arrogant, it's offensive,
            and borderline criminal.

                 Agreed. I doubt many restaurants would leave a table
                 vacant for the entire time that I would have been dining.
                 I think it's better to put a limit on the reservation
                 time to encourage people to be on time. For higher-end -
                 30 min past and your name's off the list. For lower-end,
                 you have to be there when your name's called or you're
                 passed over.

                 Try making a hotel reservation and not showing up. You
                 paid to have a table and it was there for you. Others may
                 have called and were told that nothing was available at
                 that time and so, they went elsewhere. You cannot assume
                 that the table was easily filled. It took a wait to
                 determine that you were a No Show. It is common courtesy
                 to call and cancel if you are not going to show up. If
                 you fail to do so, you will be charged for the loss. This
                 happened because people were making multiple reservations
                 for the same night and not bothering to cancel. Not
                 criminal, legal.

                 a reservation is much like an appointment, if you fail to
                 show for a doctors appointment you are charged . IF i
                 have to hold a tables for a no show why should i lose
                 money for your inconsideration. yes i could get walk ins
                 but no turnover on the tables.

       Really think about this everybody.
       Fifty years ago, the rule of restaurant management was to charge 3
       times the cost of the raw food. This really worked for decades.
       Starting about 20 years ago, this multiple has soared to 5X to 10X.
       Pasta and sauce and a bare salad - ingredients valued at $1.50 -
       being served for $13.95!!!
       Why has this MULTIPLE soared. This is not a factor of inflation.
       We're talking about the multiple. What has changed so dramatically?

                 Bick, you sound like a loser who can't get any other job
                 than a waiter. Perhaps if you had studied in school, or
                 smoked less pot, or didn't throw your life away on
                 frivolous pursuits you'd be less angry at people who are
                 paying your bills for you: your customers. The point you
                 seem to be missing is that as the customers, we matter,
                 you don't. WE don't want YOU as our waiter. We're the
                 one's with the money. Your job only exists in order to

                 your job actually is: pleasing us. Or quit and find
                 another job, because you obviously don't have the

                 In fairness, how is that any different from most
                 businesses? A clothing store puts stuff on sale at a loss
                 with the hope that people will buy things that aren't on
                 sale. A car dealership does the same thing with the most
                 popular model, hoping that when it is gone that people
                 who wanted that car will buy something similar at a
                 higher price. Business takes investment. I'm a private
                 tutor, and there are plenty of days when I'm sitting in
                 my car waiting to go tutor someone and get a call they
                 canceled, and because of the nature of the business I
                 can't charge them for it (Not if I want to keep their
                 business). My brother is a chef, and I know the high
                 costs of running a restaurant. Most fail, but the
                 successful ones can make you into a millionaire, if you
                 aren't already. When someone is spending the only money
                 they have that month to go out somewhere nice, the last
                 thing we want to hear is how the restaurant has problems.

                 good prices, and you'll do fine. Start nickel-and-diming

       This is a well written misinformed opinion piece. Yes, I understand
       this is your opinion, but you either do not understand basic
       business principles or you're not very empathetic. To not be
       empathetic to the person who had to make the steak sauce/butter and
       not be willing to pay the same mark up as you would for any other
       food menu item, is sad. When you split a dish, you often receive
       10-20% more of that dish as a rule of thumb, this then would
       explain to your concerns for the extra charge. Should I give you a
       half ounce for free, sure, let me just eat that $.35 to $.75... and
       I will do so for everyone, this couldn't possible hurt my business.
       Or even better gouge the person who doesn't want as much so you can
       have better piece of mind in paying a little less for your drink.
       Not bottled, filters water... sure it doesn't cost me anything to

            You have a point with almost everything except the splitting
            the dish part. You say that when a dish gets split that the
            customers get extra. I'm not sure why that should be, but it
            seems to be a decision you're making as the chef, not
            something being demanded by the customers, who have no idea
            they are getting extra the majority of the time. I've split
            plates before and never expected extra. Why include extra? So
            the plate looks better? Isn't that an ego thing for the chef,
            not something the customer needs to worry about? The few extra
            cents in water that it costs to wash the extra dish is
            something you can pay for as the restaurant owner. As you
            should know, when a dish is split the server often gets a
            bigger tip, in compensation for the extra effort. So things
            work out. When restaurants demand every little thing gets paid
            for I'm going to take my dollars elsewhere.

                 napkin laundered, water and glasses, flatware all washed
                 and dried for the second person who is "just tasting"
                 besides the plate itself being tasted from. The charge is
                 often to recover the cost of serving two persons for a
                 single entree fee. This is not incurred when someone just
                 dips their fork over and tastes but when the guests
                 expect the item (and sides) to be divided in the kitchen-
                 and yes, each often get more.

            You're required to have fire extinguishers and toilets too,
            you build their cost into the price of a meal. I have to admit
            I doubt any city requires you to install a filter and chilling
            system for table water but I could be wrong. Please give us a
            citation that one.
            Seems kind of like charging extra to actually *cook* the food.

       Of course, they should charge if you don't show up for your
       reservation and for food waste. They should also start charging for
       salt and pepper.

            Define "food waste." Eating food that you don't want is also
            wasting it.

                 They have to throw the food away if it spoils. And if the
                 restaurant fills 10 tables at a time and 9 of them don't
                 show up every single moment of every single day, then are
                 they not loosing money Einstein? Of course, you would be
                 forced to pay if you don't show up for your reservation.
                 Airlines, doctors, and countless other professions /
                 businesses would just shut down if you are not held
                 accountable for not showing up. Suppose you had to wait 3
                 months to get to see a specialist doctor and what if none
                 of those people ahead of you showed up? Would you not be
                 mad that they made you wait 3 months? Suppose you could
                 book flights but only had to pay if you actually boarded.
                 Then most flights would run more than half empty as there
                 is nothing to force people to show up on time. The
                 airlines would go out of business and there would be no
                 more flights. They could have reserved it for someone
                 else and made money if you didn't reserve it and then
                 failed to show up. But you are an S.0.B from S.0.B family
                 and won't change your mind as you are always right and
                 everyone else is always wrong. Can you book a flight,

            I ordered the food, and paid for it already. Whether I eat all
            of it or not is immaterial. It is gone either way. To me,
            restaurants give you too much food. If I am traveling and am
            staying in a hotel, I can't really take it with me. Of course,
            if you are talking about a buffet, that is an entirely
            different story. You can take just a bite, and get more if you
            really like something.

            What do you mean "food waste"? You mean I get charge extra if

            get to charge the restaurant for wasting my time? And as for
            charging me for missing my reservation, you can go screw
            yourself. A reservation is not a contract. I owe the
            restaurant nothing if I don't show up, since they provided me
            with nothing. A promise of holding a table is worthless.
            Anyone who has ever paid for such a thing is a total idiot.

            Are we talking chef-prepared mayo/aoli or is this just Kraft
            mayo from a jar? You would expect to pay extra to have chili
            on your fries because chili is an item you might order and pay
            for on its own. But mayo is condiment, unless someone is
            actually whisking eggs and oil back in the kitchen.

       I managed restaurants for many years.
       Proper way of handling a sharing charge
       1. Either listed on the menu or have waiter explain it before
       ordering (if requested). If the customer wasn't informed before
       they order then it would be deceitful to charge.
       2. extra plate charge should include an extra side and starter...
       unless A la cart
       3 inform customer there is no sharing allowed. Usually meaning the
       other person must order something. This doesn't mean you can't
       share your food. Just we will not bring you a empty plate with out
       ordering something. This is done usually at high end restaurants or
       at peak time.
       Adding a tip on a part of 8 or more is common. Some restaurants
       enforce it, some leave it up to serverr. Getting burned on a party
       will ruin a servers day. Most of the time that table will consume
       most of their resources. They usually stay longer and need extra
       presence. A table can ask the manager to waive this if they feel
       services wasn't par....the manger can also deny this request.

            The food costs the same whether one person eats it or two. Why
            should there be an additional charge?

                 Because you are taking up a chair that a paying customer
                 could be for one. During prime time many people are
                 turned away because there is no room which results in
                 lost revenue if you decide to get and extra plate and
                 order a glass of water. It also offsets the costs of
                 other things that are gratis such as bread and butter for
                 a table, and if the writer of the article doesn't
                 understand that there are other overhead charges such as
                 linen fees, personal that service the customer that isn't
                 paying and restaurants are not cheap to run, a small one
                 where I live is easily $5,000 a month rent. The reasons
                 are numerous and to keep entrees at a reasonable price
                 point this fee is not unreasonable.

                      Except that doesn't make sense because the table is
                      taken already. Unless they are going to sit someone
                      else at your table with you, it doesn't make sense.
                      I could see it at a Japanese steakhouse, perhaps,
                      where multiple parties might in fact share the same
                      table and so someone not eating is taking up a seat,
                      but otherwise? I guess you could say they'll dirty
                      plates, but that's really a non cost since dishes
                      are washed in mass and no individual person's plate
                      is going to require the machine to be run an
                      additional time.

                      I frequently go out all by my lonesome. Very few, if
                      any restaurants have tables "for one"; usually the
                      table I am seated at has two chairs. That extra
                      chair sits empty until I leave. So what would be the
                      big deal if I had a friend tag along who ordered
                      his/her own drink, but then shared my fries and half
                      my sandwich? The restaurant wouldn't be losing any
                      money by my friend sitting in the extra chair.

                      Rick, Nathan,Cadet... I don't think any of you see
                      how this attitude is getting abused. When I see this
                      behavior typically it's in a large party, some thing
                      like a group of 7 or more and this is when it starts
                      to cost restaurant owners money. Two table have to
                      be put together ahead of time to accommodate,
                      walk-ins can't have those seats, so you turn
                      business away, then you are prepped for 7 orders and
                      end up getting only 4 because 3 people decided to
                      share plates and we can't make up for this with
                      drinks because they order water, and the server
                      can't ignore them, they have to be treated like
                      everyone else, so refills have to be attended to,
                      they want special condiments for their "half" of the
                      order and those have to be fetched, they want more
                      bread an butter (free) brought to the table because
                      they realized they were hungrier than they
                      thought...it goes on and on. And here you have it, a
                      restaurant opens at 5pm for dinner, the 7-top
                      reservation is at 6:15, so you can't seat anyone
                      else at it because you can't be sure if they will
                      leave before your reservation gets there, so those
                      tables are tied up not only for the hour and a half
                      the party will be there but an hour and 15 mins
                      prior...and if it's a small restaurant, this really
                      starts adding up...I hope you understand what I'm
                      saying here.

               o me
                 Its the American sense of entitlement. Nothing is free.
                 That plate has to be carried by a server. The extra plate
                 has to be picked up by a server. The plate has to be
                 washed by a dishwasher. The soap and water to wash the
                 plate is not free. Everything has a cost. When I traveled
                 to Europe I learned the hard way that nothing at
                 restaurants is free. Ketchup, bread and butter cost me
                 extra. I didnt like it but I understand why they charge.

                      You'd be hard pressed to determine the incremental
                      cost of bringing one empty plate out along with the
                      order and the tip usually pays about three quarters
                      of your servers wages anyway, the cost of washing
                      said dish is likely to be under a nickel..

               o jenkins
                 iv'e been a professional line cook for 10 years, and i
                 can give reasonable explanations for everything on the
                 list, but the split plate fee seems to be the one people
                 understand the least, basically its this, first, you are
                 taking up a seat in our restaurant (which if it is a
                 halfway decent place this does actually cost us money)
                 and second/ more importantly, if you order and entree
                 (which is usually the only thing you'll see a split fee
                 on anyway) and you want it split, we will cut the
                 steak/chicken/fish in half and put it on two plates, but
                 each of those plates will have the same amount of sides
                 as a normal dish and this is what you are being charged
                 for, if you want to avoid the fee then order one and ask
                 for a second plate, this is easy and the server can get
                 you the plate without us cooks noticing, potentially
                 getting them a better tip.

                      The people I know who split their dinner, already do
                      so at the table; they aren't getting any extra
                      vegetables nor asking the cook/chief to perform a
                      special service. Don't see how a couple splitting
                      main course would be costing the restaurant money
                      for the extra seat being taken by the person sharing
                      the meal. Usually two drinks are ordered, and
                      possibly two deserts ordered as well. This would be
                      more than if just a single person came in ordered
                      one meal, one drink, one desert and asking for
                      doggie bag to take the extra food home, but took up
                      the space of a table with two chairs, but only used
                      one... the extra chair would sit empty until the
                      single person left.

                      Cadet, in your scenario I would have no problem with
                      it, but that's never how it happens in real life
                      that I experience on a daily basis. Yours is the
                      rare exception and if yours was the only way it
                      happened, restaurant owners for the most part
                      wouldn't have a problem with it either. Those extra
                      plate charges are a difficult decision for us to
                      make, but we have to in order to keep the over-all
                      cost of the meals down and still be able to give you
                      free bread and free soup or salad with your entree.

                 It's about maximizing profit. I don't have control of who
                 comes out to eat. If you need a table for one the best I
                 can do is try to offer you a bar. If you want a table I
                 have no choice but to oblige. But, If you need a table
                 for two then I have an option to maximize our profit.
                 If I ran a restaurant that didn't fill then this way of
                 thinking might be counter productive. Each restaurant has
                 different needs. It's my job to address those
                 needs...which will hopefully increase profit.

            Unless it is clearly stated on the menu, you can't include a
            surcharge for gratuity. It has to be stated up front before
            customers have a chance to order. If the customers were not
            made aware of the surcharge they have no obligation to pay it.

       They nickel and dime you to death. Everywhere, it's bait and

       price. It's restaurants, it's banks, it's airlines, it's hotels...
       everywhere.
       It's greed. It's what happens when bean-counters look at

            Except it's not. It is consumer demand that's pushed society
            into this model.
            I worked at a hotel where we did this very thing. We wrapped
            it all up in a package deal and charged, say, $100 for the
            room. And our occupancy rates were low and people said it was
            too expensive. So we pulled back, took out all the amenities
            and lowered the room rate to $75. Then had to charge for the
            amenities. The Internet was $10 a day, the breakfast was
            another $8, the gym access was $5, the premium channels was
            $10, etc. In the end, the same room we used to offer for $100
            as a package was worth $125 when split up. But suddenly,
            because the base rate was $75, people started saying the price
            was great. Then they'd add in most of the stuff they used to
            get for free, like internet and parking and breakfast and the
            real rate rose to $110 and despite the price often winding up
            HIGHER, they paid it happily and occupancy went up 30%. Some
            people complained they had to pay for those nickel and dime
            charges, but the fact is that we used to try to give the same
            to them for a major discount and they balked at it. So now
            they pay more for the same and it isn't because we were
            greedy, but because they were cheap. They'd look at the
            competition and ask why our rooms were 15% more, never taking
            into account that our rooms had all the stuff the other person
            nickel and dimed them for already built in. So to compete, we
            had to nickel and dime, too.

                 This is so much BS. It is the cheaper hotels that tend to
                 give things away for free. Hampton Inn, Hilton Garden
                 both have free internet and breakfast, but stay at a
                 higher end hotel, EVERYTHING has a charge. Forget about
                 free breakfast or free internet.

                      there is no such thing as a free lunch, or in this
                      case, a free continental breakfast. those freebies
                      you mentioned are most definitely something you pay
                      for - it's part of your nightly room rate. as they
                      are the less expensive brands, these chains can
                      afford to charge a tiny bit more because they are
                      still the cheapest game in town, but when you go to
                      the higher dollar places the competition is tougher
                      so they need to debundle everything to attract
                      customers.

                      True! Funny how you can get internet for free from
                      virtually any of the lower-end hotels, but when I
                      stayed at a nice Marriot last year it was $20/day
                      extra for it. Tell me that it runs Marriot any more
                      for their internet access than, say, a Holiday Inn
                      Express.
                      I don't mind paying for things that actually provide
                      a superior value (I'd pay for breakfast from Marriot
                      vs. continental breakfast from another place), but
                      when the quality is the same, then what gives? It's
                      like charging extra for windshield wipers on a
                      Mercedes but not on a Kia.

                 Nathan, that's not consumer demand. That's opportunism by
                 owners. I do not believe you when you say that by
                 charging more you are getting a higher occupancy in the
                 hotels. That's B.S. corporate propaganda, and is designed
                 to please shareholders, not those of us in the general
                 public who have a brain and can tell which way the wind
                 is blowing. You seem bright, but either confused about
                 reality, or suffer from corporate indoctrination. Your

                      If that's what you want to believe, more power to
                      you. But as I lived through it, I'll stick to my
                      story. Again, they wound up paying more than they
                      did before AFTER the add-ons (which used to be
                      free). Because they booked based on that "base rate"
                      which was lower. That's what was in bold on the
                      website and kayak and whatnot. All the rest was fine
                      print. And admittedly, not everyone got all that
                      stuff, some didn't get any. It could be a better
                      deal if you didn't want those things. But most did
                      want at least some of them and often the final price
                      wound up higher than the original package deal.
                      At the lower end of the chains, price differences
                      are minimal and thus not the motivating factor in
                      deciding on a room. Not much difference in $59 and
                      $65, so if one includes free wi-fi, it gets the win.
                      At the high end they can charge for what they want
                      and people willing to pay $300 for a room don't care
                      so much that it comes to $320 with amenities. But in
                      the middle range, price is a differentiator. There
                      is a difference in people's minds in a $99 room and
                      a $125 one-and free wi-fi or croissants aren't
                      enough of a selling point to make up the $26 gap. So
                      the middle band often seeks to lower the base price
                      and then make it up in amenities charges. And it is
                      because consumer behavior drives it that way.

                      Bob, I'm not denying that consumer demand is real.
                      I'm saying that the above example is not a result of
                      it. It is a result of owners price gouging their
                      customers.
                      Carolina Lawyer, you have two things going against
                      you: you're a lawyer (which means you've made a
                      career out of being an untrustworthy liar concerned
                      only with winning, not the truth.), and two, you're
                      from Carolina (North or South doesn't really
                      matter), so you it is unlikely that you have a moral
                      perspective. I'm an unabashed bigot toward people
                      from the South. The biggest mistake this country
                      ever made was fighting to get you back into the
                      Union. If you ever want to secede again, I'll help
                      you pack. Please make sure to take Texas with you.
                      All that being said, you don't read very well, since
                      I never denied the principle of consumer demand, I
                      merely said that it didn't apply in this instance.
                      The suggestion that everything that used to be
                      included is now being including only with an extra
                      charge as an example of consumer demand is something
                      only a demented lawyer or greedy business owner
                      could believe. It's just a lame justification for
                      you charging more. Harvard MBA's and corporate
                      lawyers have destroyed America. I hope you all end
                      up burning in Hell for what you've done. (Okay,
                      there is no such thing as Hell, but there should be
                      for such people).

            it is offensive to restaurant employees and owners everywhere
            to be put in the same category as banks or any "greedy"
            companies. i have worked in many many restaurants in my decade
            as a cook and every single one of them is full of assholes
            like you who think we are trying to screw people in some way,
            90% of the people who work in restaurants live well below the
            poverty line and believe it or not that also includes the
            owners and management. i know restaurant owners who work 12-14
            hours a day, 7 days a week in their own restaurant serving
            tables and dealing with customers who talk down to them,
            complain about the food and the prices, demand things for free
            and then don't tip despite the best efforts of an entire crew
            to please them. these kinds of customers end up costing the
            restaurant money. and the sad reality is that somewhere around
            HALF of the people that eat out end up being those kinds of
            customers. how dare you call them greedy, i am sure not every
            restaurant is the same, but in all my experience i have never
            seen one place that isn't full of hard working dedicated POOR
            people. however with all that being said, none of it applies
            to corporately owned chains, those places cook shit quality,
            overpriced food and they can all burn in hell.

            Some states are "dry" so you have to bring your own wine.
            Don't know if it's the same now, but many years ago when I
            live in Utah - that's what you had to do, and you paid a fee
            for them opening the bottle.

            Some people get a special bottle of wine and bring it to their
            favorite restaurant. It is the people who stop at McDonald's
            and buy food for their kids, then bring it into the
            restaurant. They take up a table for 5 or 6 people but only 2
            people order food. Then they ask for bread, and butter, and
            eat 10 loaves of free bread. And the people who ask for water
            and lemons, then put their crystal lite in the water. How
            cheap do you have to be. I can go on and on with the things I
            see every day at work. More and more restaurants are doing
            coupons. People want to use 2 to 5 for on table when it
            clearly says one per table.

       My husband and I ordered two entrees at Raymond's in Ridgewood, NJ.
       We each were eating off eachother's plate. The manager/owner,
       Joanne, had the server add a sharing charge to our bill!
       I also hate when charged an automatic tip (usually 18%) and make a
       point of telling my server and the manager that I most likely would
       have given a larger tip (Ill tip 25% for good service) if they
       hadnt taken it upon themselves to tell me how much I should leave
       on the table!

            ok, in response...I work at a large buffet style chain. The
            owner DOES NOT charge gratuity. MOST guests ASSUME it was
            added to the bill if its the typical large group of people
            that we so often see. It's not uncommon for any server in the
            place to wait on a group of 30 and receive no tip. SOOOOO, as
            a server, I make $2.13 cents per hour and have t pay taxes on
            THE CUSTOMERS TOTAL BILL (7.5%). DO the math= 30 people at
            13.00= $390.00 The gov't assumes I made AT LEAST $31.20 and
            automatically deducts it from my paycheck...(remember I make
            $2.13 an hour) I PAID FOR YOUR GROUP TO EAT THERE FROM MY OWN
            POCKET. Wonder why some servers don't waitress long term?
            Wonder why the turnover is so high? Now ya know. Why add it
            automatically? Because NO SERVER should pay for the guests to
            eat somewhere. If a guest cannot afford to pay a tip, stay
            home or go to a drive thru.
            as for plate sharing, as a server I don't give a damn about
            that. THAT isn't something servers have any control over
            pricing/not pricing. I do the best I can to take care of my
            guests, including free refills on things I shouldn't, and an
            occasional to-go box to someone that I probably should. Please
            do not be rude to these folks.
            Waiting tables is NOT an easy thinkless job. It requires a LOT
            of planning and foresight and people skills (if it's done
            correctly). If you get excellent service, please tip
            accordingly. as a guest, you CAN dispute a gratuity charge on
            a CC if the server is bad.

               o James
                 Your argument is misleading at best and completely false
                 at worst. You are not paid $2.13/hr. You are expected to
                 make up to the federal minimum wage ($7.25/hr) with
                 $2.13/hr + tips. If you do not, your employer must pay
                 the difference. Assuming that you report all of your
                 income accurately to the IRS - and most servers
                 under-report to avoid paying as much tax - it is
                 impossible for you to end up 'paying people to eat.'

                      Who, then, ends up ultimately paying for it? the

                      SURCHARGES AND FEE,S and paying higher restaurant
                      prices. Guess you've never been privy to the books
                      or owned a restaurant and YES, a server CAN pay for
                      guest to eat, especially if they have to pay TIP
                      SHARE for a table that didn't tip. 3% regardless,
                      and it will come out of the OTHER tips from guests
                      that DID leave one

                      I've worked in restaurants and what they said is
                      true. If you employer is not following it, they are
                      violating federal law. Wait staff can be paid a
                      lower hourly wage as they are expected to make
                      "commission" on the meal in the form of tips to make
                      up the difference. But, at the end of the day, you
                      have to have made federal minimum wage per hour or
                      your employer IS required to make up that
                      difference. And that should be based on the tips you
                      report (which you are required to do). Not the tips
                      you earn, bu the take home, post tipping out
                      bartenders and busboys.

                      Think about your situation a different way. Let's
                      say you work for one hour and serve one table in
                      that time for simplicity's sake. You get paid $2.13
                      for that hour on your paycheck, but your employer
                      takes tax assuming that you make $7.25. The table
                      doesn't tip, so you've paid tax on a higher amount
                      than you've made. This is bad. However, when you
                      file your taxes, the amount of income related to
                      that particular hour that you'll report as having
                      earned will be $2.13, so you'll get a tax refund for
                      it. Note that this scenario ignores the federal
                      minimum wage requirement.

                 do do NOT need to pay taxes on any assumed amount of
                 tippage. keep a diary of your tips and pay tax on the
                 exact amount. your employer may withhold based upon this
                 calculation, but withholdings are not the amount of tax
                 you pay - it is simply the amount withheld till you
                 calculate your actual liability. you may be entitled to a
                 refund, or more likely, owe uncle sam additional funds.

                      Pays to read the whole page(s) when ordering room

                 Yeah, you can dispute the tip at a buffet due to bad
                 service but they usually don't fix it. Just look at the
                 folks who were arrested for not paying an automatic tip
                 when they received poor service. Tips are optional; if
                 you can't make it up, maybe you're a crappy server. But
                 that's not my fault, so why should anyone , aside from
                 your employer, be required to pay you?

                      is that an urban myth? If you pay for the food,
                      nothing has been stolen so it is not theft. A tip,
                      by definition, is up to the diner. In addition, you
                      can pay with a credit card then contact your bank to
                      rescind part of the charge.

                      As far as I know, there's only been one documented

                      refusing a mandatory tip, and on that occasion the
                      DA "recommended" the dismissal of the charges
                      because it was a civil rather than criminal issue.
                      (Recommending the dismissal of charges is the polite
                      way of a DA saying "OMG what were you thinking?")

            Why would you be that passive aggressive about tipping? If you
            usually tip 25% and get an 18% gratuity added onto a bill when
            the service was worth it, then add the extra 7% in and don't
            be a whiny brat about it. Some places it' a matter of policy
            and the people you're childishly complaining to aren't the
            people who make such policies. I'd rather hear you bitch about
            how terrible tipping is in general than be whiny about servers
            protecting themselves.

            I'm missing something. Is Raymond's a buffet style restaurant?
            If not, and you ordered your own entries, how could they
            charge you extra? You already bought that food, and can do
            anything you want with it. I understand a sharing fee if it
            were a buffet, but not otherwise. I'm starting to think these
            policies are in place because too many people act foolishly,
            and pay for things they don't have to.

            Having worked in the service industry for many years, Let me
            say this. First of all, I am not a disgruntled employee. I
            like what I do, and take pride in giving the best service I
            can to everyone. Also, my employers bend over backwards to
            accomodate the needs of everyone to he best of their ability.
            That being said, there are some guests that they don't want
            back. It is possible to be such a pain i the butt, that they
            dont want your business. It is the exception for sure, but it
            does happen. I bet numerous people that have posted on this

            When I use to work at McDonald's, mayo was not a standard
            condiment on a regular cheeseburger; cheeseburgers came with
            mustard, ketchup, pickles and onions. So if you would go to a
            franchise McDonald's that charges for extra condiments, then
            yes, you would be charged the $.10 since mayo would be
            considered an extra condiment.

       When I go to a restaurant with 10 people, we get hit with the
       automatic tip. But if it's busy and we split up into two tables,
       tips are not added. Same number of customers. Same amount of work
       for waiters. What's the difference that warrants an automatic tips
       in one case? I don't begrudge waiters the tips, but I want to

            Because when the bill comes let's say the total is $500 (when
            in fact 10 people would be more than that usually) 20% of that
            would be $100. MOST people are stingy and would feel that a
            server shouldn't get $100 for serving food.
            I have never worked in food service but I feel adding the
            gratuity in is very fair. If you don't like it, why don't you
            stay home?

                 And lets say the meal was only $50, so that'd be $10. Did
                 the waiter at the $500 restaurant do any more work than
                 the waiter at the $50 restaurant? Why should their tip be
                 based on the price of the meal at all. Percent based
                 tipping is frankly ridiculous.

                      Unless you actually know what they did or didn't do
                      behind the scenes, saying that percent tipping is
                      ridiculous is pretty ridiculous. I've worked in
                      higher and lower end restaurants and yes, I did do a
                      lot more at the higher end places-much of which the
                      customers never saw. For example, riding the kitchen
                      on my customer's behalf to make sure they get their
                      food in a timely manner and even rejecting dishes
                      not cooked properly. At Chili's, half that food
                      comes out of a bag or mix made and sent to you from
                      corporate. You get some lame looking chicken fingers
                      then tough. That's what the pre-breaded frozen bag
                      sent to us had in it. Tough. But at a higher end
                      place where the slice and bread their own chicken,
                      you can, as a waiter, send back unacceptable pieces
                      and demand recooks on behalf of your customers.
                      Things like that.

                 That's because a server DOESN'T deserve $100 for serving
                 food. I'm getting to the point where I'm done with
                 tipping on the bill. A $2 tip per person at a cheap
                 place, and perhaps $4 or $5 at a nice place is enough. If
                 I'm sitting there with my family at a nice place, there
                 are four of us, and we stay for about an hour. The server
                 then gets $20 in tips. That's more than a private school
                 teacher, so that's more than enough for someone that did
                 not have to earn a college degree to get the job. While
                 it takes people skills, and a fair amount of timing, it
                 isn't a job that requires any real professional skills.
                 $20 an hour for a server at a fine restaurant is more
                 than enough. I hope tipping on the amount of the check is
                 becoming extinct. It's a remnant from the era when
                 waitressing was the only decent job a woman could get and
                 support a family on. That era is over, and it is no
                 longer necessary to provide a career-level income to
                 servers. It's a temporary job while you become an actor,
                 or go to school, or something like that. Times change,
                 and tipping practices should too.

                 i agree with godot - unless a server goes WAY above and
                 beyond the call of duty, how can you possibly justify a
                 100$ tip for a large party? a dinner might last what -
                 maybe an hour? even if the server was dedicating 100% of
                 their time to your party (and they arent) and your party
                 alone thats 100$ an hour. thats an effective salary of
                 200k$ a year for the time they are waiting on your party.
                 is that really a reasonable expectation? thats why
                 tipping a percentage makes little sense.
                 I have tipped a few dollars on a 100$ meal before because
                 the bulk of the cost was an expensive bottle of wine. I
                 have also tipped 20$ on a 6$ order of chili and grilled
                 cheese because I got service that was above and beyond. I
                 think this is a much more reasonable way to go.

                      then worked your table plus 2 more in the next hour,
                      should they get 110$ for that same hour of work just
                      because it was fillet mignons all around? of course

            It actually isn't the same amount of work, big parties are a
            lot more. At a minimum, restaurants strive to deliver an
            entire table's worth of food at once. That means the kitchen
            has to coordinate what meals-and parts of meals-it is making
            when so that one guy's salad isn't done and wilting for 10
            minutes while another guy's well done steak is cooking. Rather
            you have to start the steak and remember in 8 minutes to make
            the salad. So when you are at a table of 4 or 5, that is a lot
            easier to keep straight and coordinate-and to mix in with
            orders from other tables cooking at the same time-than a party
            of 10 which requires much greater coordination and can even
            lock out the start of cooking for other tables and add to
            other table's wait times.
            Additionally, statistically, larger parties tend to take up
            tables longer. Because the group is larger, perhaps, there is
            more socializing. So while a table of five may leave after 45
            minutes, a table of ten may stay an hour or more. And waiters
            make money by flipping tables. If you and your wife come in,
            order $40 of food, and decide to tip 15% ($6), then your
            leaving in 30 minutes is far more beneficial to the waiter
            (who can get another table to do the same, netting them $12
            that hour) than your lingering for an hour and still only
            leaving $6. Larger groups tend to do the latter. So the auto
            gratuity-often set higher than 15%-helps compensate for that.
            Also, large groups, especially when paying separately, almost
            always skimp on the tip. Perhaps people assume someone else
            down the way tipped enough so now they don't have to. Who
            knows. But having worked in multiple restaurants, between the
            coordination involved, the table time, and the lower tips
            without an auto-gratuity added...I've yet to work in a
            restaurant where anyone actually wanted to take the large
            party that walks in the door. Waiters usually want to avoid
            them-except for the guaranteed tip.

                 I'd like to see tipping practices change from being a
                 percentage of the bill to being a set amount per person.
                 A cheap place (like a Denny's) can be a $2 tip per
                 person. A nice place can be $4 or $5 per person. There is
                 no reason servers should be making more money than
                 teachers, nurses, cops or firefighters, but they
                 routinely do in fine restaurants. That's just wrong. I
                 can't justify leaving a tip based on a percentage for
                 someone that just brought me my food. If I'm in a really
                 nice place, and the server is doing some table-side
                 prep/cooking, that's totally different.

            Many people tip based off the total price of the bill.
            Splitting a dish reduces the bill and takes away from the tip.
            The waiter/waitress is basically doing work for something they
            wouldn't get tipped on.

                 So, if the 2 people were going to just order 2 house
                 salads, that'd be ok. But, if one orders the house salad
                 and the other orders a filet mignon and gives a bite or
                 two to the person with the salad, that's punishable? As
                 the author said, it'd be understandable if the request
                 was to split the entree into 2 entrees, dressed up and
                 served. The charge can be justified that the waiter or
                 the cook had to do additional work for the same price.
                 Otherwise, you'd be charging for "you might have eaten a
                 more expensive meal" which is ridiculous. Are you going
                 to charge a person for ordering the cheapest meal in the

                 "Doing work"?!? No, the server is not doing extra work.
                 The chef might do a little by plating on two dishes, but
                 the server is only carrying the dish from the kitchen to
                 the table. The idea of charging more for the same amount
                 of food is ludicrous. If you split a plate and it
                 includes additional sides and extras, that is different
                 and should be charged for, but not if there isn't any
                 extra food. You don't get to charge for every last little
                 thing you do. Well, you can try, but I won't pay. See you

       I was in Rome a couple of years ago and while walking toward the
       Vatican on the Via Della Conciliazione where there are many small
       restaurants, my wife and I decided to stop and get something to
       eat. We found a nice little deli and looked at the posted prices. A
       cheeseburger, fries, and a coke for me, 3 pieces of toasted biscuit
       and bruschetta for my wife was going to be about 30 Euro ($ 45.00)
       expensive, but we had a great view of the Vatican. We sat at a
       small card table with two folding chairs and ate lunch. When we got
       our bill, it was 50 Euros ($ 75.00). Remember, this was for a
       burger, frys, 3 small pieces of toast and a couple of sodas. We
       were told that the prices for sitting down at our table cost more.

            In Italy it is customary in restaurants including coffee shops
            to charge a table charge if you sit down instead of eating at
            a counter standing up. Is is called a "copperto" charge.

                 Ordering a cheeseburger and fries in Rome, Paris, or
                 anywhere outside the US is simply gauche. A large part of
                 the joy of travel is sampling the local cuisine. But a
                 cheeseburger? A cheeseburger? In a city with wonderful

                      a burger, drink and some chips. What planet do you

                      I get to make an informed choice, and I have to pay.
                      If they increase the price after I've already made
                      my selection they can go screw themselves. Why
                      should I pay? Just because they said so? So what?
                      Who the heck are they? Just because it's their
                      restaurant doesn't mean I have to listen to them in
                      such a situation. Again, if you tell me beforehand,
                      I should pay. If you want to charge me extra after?

            It is understandable in buffets, to prevent wastage because
            people do go nuts at the buffet. Sushi buffets charge you for
            leaving rice behind on the plate.

                 treat the customer accordingly. A restaurant that does
                 that would never loose a regular customer over a $1

       This guy is getting carried away by his own article. Of course, the

       don't see a "million" reasons for not finishing every morsel,
       except in the rare case of a guy who suddenly got ill in the middle
       of his meal, or was forced to leave due to an emergency. Without
       bringing in the orphans of Somalia who go hungry every night,
       commonsense dictates that while you are getting a good deal on
       pigging out, you are being served the food to throw it away.
       Whoever is trying to show his "class" by leaving food on the plate

            Buffets factor in to their prices that a certain proportion of
            their diners will take seconds, thirds, or more. What if a
            diner takes one plate, takes a normal amount of food on that
            plated, then cannot, for whatever reason, finish it, why
            should that person be gouged?

       If the 'Steak Sauce' is a labor intensive bordelaise, I understand
       an upcharge. You have to emulsify bone marrow into it, and
       processing that stuff is a chore. The charge for a rocks pour I get
       too, because it is extra product the bartender is pouring. Asking
       the restaurant to eat the extra half ounce of a premium liquor is
       like asking the guy building your house to eat the extra cost of

       As a restauranteur I am very intrigued with this blog & your point
       of view. On a side note, really love that you are reminding people
       of etiquette, there seems to be a loss of it these days. My husband
       & I have had extensive discussions about many of your acceptable &
       unacceptable surcharges - as customer's we prefer an all inclusive
       price for our entree (including the side, perhaps a salad & bread
       service in the price of the meal); that of course depends on the
       type of restaurant you are choosing to experience. An automatic
       gratuity for parties of 6 or more should always be pointed out to
       the guest - we leave it up to the discretion of our servers (if
       they choose to always add gratuity they may miss out on a better
       tip, if their service warrants - but if they add the tip they had
       better present it to our guests). When Joe & I sit down for our
       late dinner tonight (so goes the nature of our business), we will
       no doubt have a very interesting conversation over your blog post -
       thank you!

       It is just what you are used to, no right or wrong. In a lot of
       restaurants in Asia, you actually pay for the hot tea and the rice
       separately. Each bowl or rice and each cup of tea cost extra.
       People are used to that way of paying and do not think anything of
       it.

       OK some of those extra charges do suck but I actually get the Meal
       Splitting one. I've done this many times and pretty much anywhere
       I've done it, they did not just split the meal down the middle and
       serve it on two plates. Both of us got a full serving of the side
       dishes and it was only the main dish that was split in half. Not
       sure the author did their research on this one. It sounds like one

            We went to Rudy's Teller House restaurant in Silverton, CO and
            ordered an adult meal for our 2 year old twins and asked for a
            second plate. It was an empty plate. They added $6 to the
            bill. Nobody ever mentioned that they'd charge us that amount.
            I would have declined and had them share the plate (which

                      an unusual sight. And no - no 'No Kids' sign
                      outside. And no - I didn't tip extra because a) they
                      added a tip to the bill that they overcharged us on
                      by $20 already, and b) they didn't leave a mess.
                      Rudy didn't have a problem with the kids, except to
                      charge us $6 for an empty plate. His problem was
                      that he was adding charges to the bill because he
                      knew we were tourists and didn't care whether we'd
                      ever come back. 20 years ago he would have been
                      right, but today - too easy to provide feedback to

            Well i guess u better believe in magic.
            Because people are doing sh!t for u thus they must be paid. If
            u believe in magic then the drinks will pour themselves and
            plates will clear themselves and food will arrive.
            If you cant afford to tip then eat at home. Dont go half assed
            and expect to be treated like some king because in reality
            you're probably lower then a server.

            It is difficult to consider food services as a profession when
            members of that industry post that they spit in food.
            If you want to be treated as a professional, you need to act

       Not one mention anywhere of the disgusting habit of calculating or
       charging tip ...ON THE TAX! Yes, restaurants now present the bill
       total without telling you how much of the bill is tax (here in
       Houston, 8.25%) and then pre-calculate 20% tip on the total with
       the tax included (some require you pay the tip regardless of the
       actual quality of the service).
       I do not tip at all when they do that (yeah, yeah, servers have to
       earn a living, true, but they are not required to do it working at
       THAT restaurant). If I wanted to tip my government, I'll do it
       directly rather than to a restaurant that never seems to quite get
       it forwarded on to Uncle Sam.

            Servers in Texas make $2.80 cents an hour. They're expected to
            make up the difference between that and the state minimum wage
            through their tips. If they don't make the minimum wage, then
            and only then the restaurant will make up the difference in
            minimum wage, but usually the restaurant will fire them
            instead. This can occur in as little as two or three days, and
            since lunch shifts earn less than dinner shifts, due to people
            ordering essentially snacks and generally slower traffic, a
            server can lose their job in as little as a week. Think about
            that the next time you're indignant about your tip being
            calculated for you on your receipt, something the server would
            have no control over.

                      Texas is one of the very few states that does this.
                      Most other states pay their waiters the state
                      minimum wage and tips aren't as critical. My point
                      being that you're punish a waiter for a restaurant
                      policy he has no input into is asinine, and how
                      punishing the server for a petty line on a
                      pre-printed receipt is not going to punish the

                 Since you've been in the trenches and survived the wars,

                 to expect your customers to directly pay your employees
                 wages and then fire the employee and hold the customers
                 responsible for failing to make up the difference. I have
                 only ever worked in hotels where the wait staff have all
                 earned minimum wage plus what ever arrangement of tips
                 (usually 80% to the wait staff and 20% to the
                 cooks/busboys).

       (Kentlands) charge rediculously double tip with different names
       like servce fee and gratitude fee etc if we use groupon or

            is cr@p! Try Minerva at the intersection of 355 and Shady
            Grove. It is a THOUSAND times better in quality and service.
            Tandoori is charging exorbitant prices because of the
            location. It could be justified if the food and the service
            were good. When they first opened, I ordered a few very

       I do understand some of the charges, and have paid a number of
       them, but certainly not all of them. One that I do understand but
       still disagree with is the automatic tip for large groups. If they
       are going to do it they should never have it at 20%. I could see
       15%. Typically for standard service I give 20% rounded up. For
       exceptional service I leave more like 25-30%.
       I have had many recent experiences when with my coworkers at a
       business lunch where they added the 20% tip, but I would not have
       left a 20% tip. One recent trip we had 7 people, wound up being
       there for 3 hours, and didn't have dessert or anything. It took
       over an hour to get drinks. More than half of us didn't get what we
       ordered, and the waiter argued with one of our people that she had
       ordered wrong! One person got ice water spilled down her front. We
       tried to flag down the waiter and were ignored. We were there at a
       prime time and there was only 1 server, but we were the only people
       in there, other than the hostess. Now we know why! Had there been a
       manager we would have argued the charge, but there was no manager
       and we wanted out of there. The waiter had to add 20%, we certainly
       would not have.
       I have also had the experience when in college where everyone put
       in what they believed the owed and left. As the last one there I
       wound up paying over $50 for a side salad and water because other
       people didn't include the cost of drinks, taxes, or tip. That's why
       I understand automatically adding the tip.
       I like it when the bill comes with tip guidelines at the bottom
       (i.e., 15% tip equals a certain amount, 18%, 20%, etc.). I do the
       math in my head, but it makes things quicker, and there's no doubt
       how much you're leaving. I would never walk out without tipping. If
       the service is really bad and you need to make a statement, you
       leave a very small amount. Otherwise it looks like you just forgot.

            Marge, I agree that hidden fees are awful but let me tell you
            my experience as a server in a buffet type restaurant when
            they DO NOT add 20% I customarily serve large groups of people
            from 8-40 and sometimes more. The owner of my business DOES
            NOT add gratuity. It is NOT uncommon for the guests to ASSUME
            it was paid and leave no tip at all. So, now you have a server
            (and it's not just me) that certainly isn't going to do a
            stellar job if she thinks she's not going to get paid....and

                 people fail to realize is that the TIP does not go AT ALL
                 to the restaurant. It goes to the server. The TIP should
                 be based Solely on the service you received from the
                 Server. Not on the dumb policy of the restaurant. If the
                 restaurant has a policy that you do not agree with, then
                 don't go. Its not the waiters fault. That's like going to
                 a restaurant and complaining to the waiter about the
                 prices. "Oh this is ridiculous price" Ok, so what? can
                 the waiter change that price? oh so i guess since the

                 you receive great service. Am I a server?? No, I never
                 have been one. But i am not a moronic idiot. If there is
                 something that i don't agree with at a restaurant I wont
                 eat there, other than eating there, take up one of the
                 servers tables for a good hour, complain about it to the
                 server, who has NO say so in the matter but is simply
                 doing there job, and then take the money THEY DESERVED
                 from their income. Whether or not you pay for a tip does
                 not affect the restaurant they already received their pay
                 in full from your plate.

       A group of about 10 of us went out for dinner and had the absolute
       worst experience with restaurant staff , especially the waitstaff.
       We were able to convince the restaurant manager to remove the
       automatic 18% gratuity so that we could leave a tip that was more
       fitting of the service we'd received that day.

            If you don't want to tip, don't go out. While I do sympathize
            with someone getting bad service, in my experiance, those that
            complain about tips being included in large parties are
            typically the people that are the reason that policy is in
            place.

       When I go out and they play these games it comes directly out of
       the waiter's tip. Same with delivery charges. If they charge for
       delivery, that's coming out of tip. Wedge of lemon for my water?
       Tip. Refills? Tip.
       I'm sorry. I leave 20% almost everywhere I go, but I only accept
       this hassle and harrassment from the phone company.

            they have NO say over. I would spit in your food.

       There is a very good pizza place by my house. I love their food but
       they charge $1.50 to put fresh rosemary or thyme on a pizza as they
       consider it a "premium topping" They also use such a tiny amount
       it's maybe 5 cents worth. I stopped eating there because the extras
       were just crazy.

            And that's what it really comes down to. If the customer does
            not like the extra charges, the customer can choose not to go
            to that establishment. If enough customers so choose, things
            will change. If the extra charges don't bother the majority of
            customers, things won't change.

       Restaurants should probably spell things out more clearly. For
       example, if there's a problem with people eating 3 bowls of
       complimentary salad and then sending the food back or taking it
       home, set a policy and put it on the menu.
       As for the customers... They need to realize that when they go to a
       restaurant, "it is what it is."
       Don't like the music or atmosphere?
       Don't like noise from other paying customers?
       Don't agree with the tipping system in the USA?
       Don't agree with extra charges that are clearly spelled out?
       Then don't go to the restaurant. It's as simple as that. You can't
       just show up and expect them to change rules because you don't like
       them.

            I'm with you, except for the noise factor. Depending on the
            restaurant and atmosphere, there's an acceptable amount of
            noise that should be coming from any given table. It's rude to
            approach or exceed that level, i.e., no yelling and screaming
            at a fine-dining establishment.

       At the bars I frequent (in Chicago), neat drinks definitely do have
       more alcohol in them than a normal shot. So (to choose an analogy
       that a person with the author's level of sophistication can
       probably understand), just like it's okay for 7-11 to charge more
       for a Super Big Gulp than for a regular Big Gulp, it's okay for a
       bar to charge more for a neat drink than for a regular one.
       Furthermore, anyone who knows what a neat drink is should be aware
       that they contain more, but even if you don't, once it is explained
       to you, how can you complain about paying an extra dollar or two?
       Oh... and by the way, there is no such thing as a neat "cocktail"
       because a cocktail contains more than one ingredient, so if the
       author doesn't even know what a cocktail is, how can he presume to
       criticize bar pricing?

            You realize that you're getting charge five dollars a drink at
            a minimum for what costs the bar/restaurant less than a dollar
            to make for you, correct? Restaurants and bars make more
            profit off of drinks than they do off of food, this is a
            truism known to people even who haven't worked a bar or
            tables. To state that you're all right being charged more for
            a drink "neat" is an interesting statement to make, as a
            "neat" drink doesn't contain any more alcohol than ordering it
            with a mixer.

       I am a server, and these extra charges are understandable. You
       might try blaming this on greedy, cheap, and what can I get for
       free people. We serve bread, not all orders come with bread
       especially if you get sandwiches but still they expect them and we
       don't charge them, same with jelly. We also lose work hours because
       of food costs. I would love to charge everyone of these cheap
       asses, its totally not going to affect my tip because they are not

               o restaurantmanners
                 Clearly you've never worked in a restaurant before. It's
                 understandable if your server is a total idiot and messes
                 up your entire order, then yes, leave no tip. But people
                 who go into restaurants looking for reasons to NOT tip
                 are awful. You tip because your in a restaurant and these
                 people (who are not YOU) are literally bringing you food
                 prepared the way you ordered to your table. The money you
                 pay goes towards the cost of the food and preparation.
                 The servers are paid minimum wage and whatever tip they
                 do receive gets deducted out of their already tiny pay
                 check. So what you leave on the table is what they go
                 home with. You can argue that when you go to Europe you
                 do not tip, and why why why do we tip in the US? For the
                 cheapos out there that loooove to cite this factoid,
                 here's your answer - Servers in Europe get paid way way
                 more per hour then servers do in the US. They get paid so
                 much that serving jobs are actually considered a decent
                 and reliable way to make a living. And to tip on top of
                 it would be insulting. But here in the US, that is not
                 the case at all, and our country has a different way of
                 doing it. Trust me, I wish it was like Europe so I could
                 avoid cheap unkind people who try to find any reason why
                 they shouldn't tip. What I love imagining is putting
                 these people in a server's shoes for an hour and seeing
                 how long it takes them until they cry and run home.
                 Sincerely, your Ivy league educated server who is funding
                 grad school with a restaurant job.

                      Another fun fact about Europe, or at least France,
                      is that tip is factored into the bill. Some
                      restaurants don't even make it clear that it's a
                      tip. So they love American tourists who come in and
                      leave 20% because they didn't know the tip was
                      already added to the bill

                      edpepters101 - Please enlighten me on what I have
                      not comprehended based on what you have written in
                      the comment above. Your stance on tipping seems
                      pretty clear - "I would love to be able to deduct a
                      percentage of my meal due to inconsiderate staff."
                      So basically, what your saying is you'd like to pay
                      less for your meal then what it is actually worth
                      based on what you deem to be bad service... Firstly,
                      anyone who goes on CNN and proudly admits to be
                      being a bad tipper is someone I think anyone could
                      justly question his/her ability to "comprehend" what
                      good/bad service actually is. Secondly, your logic
                      here is not accurate at all. What does the food
                      quality have to do with service? You could have an
                      amazing server and terrible food or terrible service
                      and amazing food, but as far as your concerned, if
                      you deem someone a bad server, you should pay less
                      for the actual food then what it is worth? That's
                      like saying you'd like to pay less for a burrito at
                      a taco truck because the taco truck driver was rude
                      to you. As far as comprehension goes, It looks as if
                      your the one who needs a refresher. Lastly, I don't
                      smoke.

                      it always amazes me that some people like yourself
                      think you deserve to be tipped. i have worked at
                      restaurants when i was younger, and I enjoyed the
                      tips I received, But I NEVER expected a tip, nor
                      would I call someone cheap for not leaving one. Not
                      in public, not in private, and not online. You tried
                      to justify your feeling by saying the servers only
                      make minimum wage, SO WHAT. That is what the job
                      pays. When I worked as a server it was 4.25 an hour.
                      Yes that is low, No you can't support a family on it
                      or even yourself, but I TOOK THE JOB. I didn't
                      expect anyone else to give away their hard earned
                      money because I didn't make much.
                      The price on the menu is not just for the food and
                      preparation, it is also for the rent, and the
                      utilities, and the napkins, and yes the hourly wages
                      of the servers. I don't always tip, but I do tip
                      regularly. I tip when the service was good and the
                      server kept in contact to see to my needs. But by no
                      means is a tip required, or automatic.
                      I have been to places that charge 20% gratuity for
                      groups larger than 5, really 5. Me, wife, 3 kids,
                      anyone else and I have to add 20%. maybe we are
                      taking my Mom and Dad to dinner for a birthday...
                      that makes 7, add 20 percent. So i made two
                      reservations for tables next two each other, the
                      same server tended to both tables, and there was no
                      automatic tip. My point is adding a tip based on
                      group size is rediculous. because you will still
                      serve the same number of people, they will just be
                      in 1 party, or in 2 or 3 parties.
                      Tipping is not a requirement, serving food does not
                      make you a saint for doing so at minimum wage, it
                      makes you employed. Very few professions are
                      associated with tipping, and it is always voluntary.
                      But go ahead and keep judging people and calling
                      them names because they didn't tip, or don't
                      altogether.... because you are the one that looks
                      ungratful, with your hand out demanding something
                      more than the paycheck you work for. Go ahead and
                      try to make people feel bad because you feel the pay
                      is too low, many of your customers know the pay is
                      low, but you don't tip the guy at walmart for
                      telling you what was on Aisle 4, and you don't tip
                      the lady at the grocery store for letting you know
                      the soap you are buying is buy one get one free.
                      Many of these workers also work for minimum wage,
                      and work just as hard with no expectation of a tip.
                      Be grateful, but judgemental.

                      Servers are often paid well BELOW minimum wage- many
                      states have kept them at $2.13 per hour. The tip is
                      by far the bulk of their income. There is virtually
                      no other job where the customer determines the rate
                      of pay so totally. The cook is paid by management,
                      regardless of whether food is burned or undercooked.
                      If they perform poorly, they may lose their job but
                      they cannot NOT be paid for hours they are clocked
                      in. This is true in any job- workers are not docked
                      pay at the sole discretion of the customer who may
                      or may not "believe" in paying for services
                      rendered. Great! If the guest is a doctor, I will
                      decide to dock their pay because of the long wait in
                      the office. A lawyer? They did not get me the
                      settlement I wanted- I will deduct money from their
                      fee. Boy- this is really fun- the POWER!!!!!!! I see
                      why people do not want to give up tipping. It makes
                      them feel important. Sigh. Really?

               o ORChuck
                 You can. On the "tip" line on the card slip, just write a
                 negative number and subtract it off. The manager is
                 probably going to want to talk to you about why you felt
                 the need to do that. But, if you have a good reason, then
                 it's justified.
                 I've only done this once. The manager listened to what I
                 told him and then tore up the slip and comped the entire
                 bill. On the way out, he met us with gift certificates
                 for a return visit which was very smart on his part
                 because it encouraged us to come back and give his
                 establishment a second chance.

                      What would ever possess you to do something so
                      disrespectful as to write in a negative tip? Christ.
                      Why not, instead of being a sarcastic ass, just TALK
                      to the manager. But no, you have to make a big drama
                      show out of it. Provided the server didn't jump up
                      on your table and do the Harlem Shake on your plate,
                      I see no reason to ever go so far as you did.

            From my experience, a waiter or waitress who is guaranteed a
            tip due to the size of the party is simply sleepwalking
            through the service aspect of the meal. If he/she knows in
            advance that they will receive a 15 to 25%
            gratuity...regardless of their level of service...then, there
            is no incentive to offer great service that EARNS that
            automatic tip.
            Every time I or my friends have encountered that "party of six
            required gratuity" language on a menu, we have asked the
            manager to waive that mandatory charge; if he does, we stay
            and eat and generally will leave 25% for excellent service. If
            he declines, we get up and leave and never return.
            Simple as that.

            And why would that not just be factored into the price? It
            sounds like you work for a restaurant that isn't run properly.
            If the owner(s) doesn't have the total cost of their meals,
            figuring in the 'extras', then they aren't on top of it.
            Thinking of charging for jelly is nuts. Personally, I just
            don't like surprise costs, and that makes the restaurant look
            cheap. If someone added $.20 for jelly I'd figure they were
            hinting that they didn't care about me being a customer and I
            wouldn't be back.
            The space, table, and utilities that I'm using is factored in.
            The utensils and washing of them is factored in. The wait
            staff, cooks, and bus service is factored in. So to think of a
            piece of bread and jelly as being unreasonable when, from what
            it sounds like, that's a common request is nutty. Time to talk
            to management about upping the price of the meal to cover the
            cost.

       some enterprising technokid set up a website providing comments

       My biggest gripe is pizza joints that charge full price for
       toppings that I only want on half of the pizza. So I want a pizza
       with half sauaage and half pepperoni. They charge for 2 toppings.
       It takes an extra 2 seconds to switch from putting pepperoni on the
       pizza to putting sausage on the other half. And it's no more
       difficult to cut a pizza like that.
       So I'm paying for two full toppings... Why can't they at least put
       twice as much on each half?

       My parents own an Indian restaurant in NYC. They never require nor
       get pissed about people leaving tips or not. Nor will they add an
       extra 20% for people who eat there. Especially if they ever see
       students eating there, they give them a discount and never take
       tips. Here in NYC if you go to eat some places charge you extra
       just to sit on their chairs. I don't see why I have to tip a

       Charging a credit card fee surcharge if the customer uses a credit

       The bagel slicing thing in NY sounds ridiculous but it actually
       makes sense. In NY there is no sales tax on unprepared food. This
       is to help the poor buy groceries. But there is regular sales tax
       on prepared foods. So bagels at a bagel shop typically have regular
       sales tax, but if they sell them un-sliced, the shop can claim it
       is an unprepared food item and skip charging the sales tax.

       Oh, and you can't make reservations. You show up, stand outside for
       over an hour, and get treated like cattle.
       The only reason we went to this place was because a friend really

                 He was talking about two people sharing the same meal. So
                 the server will get a smaller tip because there is only
                 one entree on the bill, not two. So, 20% of one meal will
                 be less than 20% of two meals.

            @mattk In regards to your last comment about Italians charging
            you for bread, I experienced a similar matter while visiting
            Florence. I frequent Italy almost every summer to visit my
            family, and in most piazzaâs in popular tourist locations,
            restaurants/bars/trattorias tend to charge more if you were
            sitting down at one of their tables (either inside or out)
            than if you were standing up or taking something to-go. Itâs a
            commonly known thing in the major cities that very few
            tourists know (unless they're staying with locals). Kind of
            crazy, right?
            I think the bread situation really depends on the type of
            dining location youâre in and what region. I personally donât
            eat bread with my dinner (unless Iâm having a quick sandwich
            at a bar), but Iâve been in restaurants in Europe where they
            do and donât serve bread with meals. I think it's up to their
            preference or have some correlation to how "touristy" their
            location is.

       I myself work in hospitality in NYC. I can tell you what lengths
       people go to get get anything for free. This article is a proof of
       that. Unfortunately most guests take it out on the servers when it
       is NOT their faults and leave these hard working Americans with no
       tip. Managers and Cooks get paid salary or by the hour, servers
       make their living by tips (The $5 an hour barley covers their
       taxes). So when a classless guest stiffs the server, it does not
       send a message to anyone else in the restaurant except that server.
       It is a shame that NYC dining has become a waiting room for errors.
       People dine and wait for any little thing to go wrong so they can
       get out of paying a tip or try to argue a free round of drinks. It
       is as if restaurants have to pay for some type of 'pain and
       suffering' the guests experienced during their dinner. And yes, it
       is easy to notice who the condiment hoarders are since they always
       start with "I never do this but can I get some more? I am soooo
       hungry, oh my god I am sooo sorry". They like to fill up on all the
       complimentary items as much as they can to save a buck, driving
       everyone in the restaurant to hustle around for free refills and
       stop managers to complain after they had to wait for their third
       refill, and how unfair and poor service, and 'never again will I
       come here' and 'I am going to go onto yelp', etc. I work in a
       restaurant with a large out door dining area. I have even had
       people become upset with the restaurant because they saw a roach
       OUTSIDE!!!! In NYC!!!! I will be writing a book towards the end of
       my career and fill it with all the excuses people come up with just
       to get something free or have a reason not to tip. There is nothing
       wrong with the restaurants, there is something wrong with your
       level of class if you can not just simply go out and enjoy a meal
       without complaining about every possible excuse you can find.

            try to double up on any of the "complimentary" items like

            freebies and take the actual dinner home to eat the next day.
            Then they'll make some unusual requests like "extra mushrooms

            Best policy is to have restaurant state prices and fees
            clearly on the menu. That way, customer is not surprised in
            the end. And as for tips, I don't believe in tips as a
            compensation for the wait staff. It should be restaurant's
            responsibility to adequately compensate wait staff. Customers
            should only tip if the wait staff has gone beyond the expected
            service level.

            restaurants. If you think work is hard and pay is low then
            quit! Originally, tipping was to reward for outstadning
            service but little by little it has now become a standard fee.
            And at one time it was 5%, then 8% then 10% then 12% then 15%
            then 18% and now it's 20%!!. You go outside of USA and tipping
            in restaurants, cabd, and hotel is totally optional. And in

            Chipolte staff do beside take my order? Why would they even

                      realize that your earning capacity will be directly
                      related to skills and anout of effort you're willing

                      But more importantly, when we go out to eat, the
                      business relationship is between the patron and the
                      business owner. COmpensation of wait staff, cook and
                      otehrs is not patron's business. So, any issues of
                      wages and work difficulties is between the staff and
                      the owner.

       HEY! Maybe I can start charging the cheapskates who ask for 30
       lemon slices and make their own lemonade with 20 sugar packets and
       our free tap water to go along with their split sandwich and sit in
       my table for 3 hours while paying customers get turned away. And
       then go home and YELP that we suck because we didn't let them bring
       their car-sized stroller inside, or turn the AC and music off
       because you "don't like it".
       NOTHING irritates me more than idiots who have no idea how
       expensive or mentally taxing it is to run a restaurant. I get this
       all of the time "But I can get this at the supermarket for $2 - why
       am I paying $5". To which I would love to say, "go open the package
       and eat it in aisle three, then."
       Our time and craft is as valuable as any other. A little respect,
       please. You would not ask a sales rep at KOHLS to take a shirt and
       change the sleeves from short to long, because you don't wear short
       sleeves. You would not ask Ben or Jerry to remove the nuts from
       chunky monkey because you can't eat nuts. You would not call up
       Peter Jackson to demand a LOTR with a little louder soundtrack,
       because you are bringing your elderly aunt along who has hearing
       problems, And you probably (I'm guessing) wouldn't insist on
       firearms with "child sized" triggers at the gun range for your
       toddler. Or maybe you would. And also get really pissed when you
       can't park your hybrid car/stroller/suv on the dining room patio
       because even if it blocks all access to everything, it fits there
       and you should be able to.

       I went to this upscale restaurant a few weeks ago and had a pretty
       decent time with my GF and a decent meal too.
       I got the check and something seemed off. It seemed a little bit
       too high so I checked the receipt closely and I saw that those Sons
       of bi__ches charged us $0.99 a minute for breathing oxygen. I
       angerly called the waitress over and she confirmed the fee. I paid
       my bill and stormed out of there and the waitress gave me an evil
       eye for not tipping her. A few days later when I checked my bank
       statement I saw that she went ahead and added a 20% tip to my bill
       and then I got charged a No Tipping penalty fee of 10%.

                 I dont know who you are but my family runs a restaurant
                 and although we don't support the "people" you mention of
                 that are cheap and It seems like itâs because you are a
                 waiter/waitress as well. I also worked in several
                 restaurants, I actually havenât seen many people you
                 mentioned in your comment but itâs not right when you are
                 being charged for breathing air. What the waiter/waitress
                 did is illegal and if you are supporting it then your
                 entire argument is invalid. Maybe you should get a
                 education so you donât have to work as a waiter/waitress.
                 I moved so far from the point where I was that waitress
                 and I have never seen anyone that complained as much as
                 you did. This is why you donât deserve a tip. if you say
                 waiters/waitresses make their living through tips then
                 find another job. It seems as if the only place you
                 belong is working minimum wage.

            Were you made aware of the charge for the time spent at the

            disputed the charge with the manager and refused to pay.
            Second, regardless of whether I agree with your decision to
            not tip the waitress, I have to ask WHY you did not call the
            establishment and dispute the charge. If you had called the
            bank or the credit card company, they would have removed that
            20% and 10% charge which is NOT on your copy of the credit
            card receipt. Did you strike out the area against "Tip"?

       With today's technology I don't understand why places will not

       Factory. The Cheesecake Factory that had the same exact computer
       system as the ones here in NC (where every restaurant will split
       the check). The Cheesecake Factory that has check splitting built
       into the ordering system. And yet they refused to split the bill.

            As a restaurant owner, I can tell you why restaurants dislike
            splitting checks. It has nothing to do with the technology or
            the speed of processing the sale. It has to do with theft.
            Many times, when there is a table with multiple checks, one of
            the checks will go "missing" at the end of the night. 8 people
            dine, 7 people pay and the one person will skip out without
            paying. This is especially true when customers have to come up
            to a register to pay. The waitstaff and/or cashier have to be
            really attentive to keep this from happening. It's just easier
            to say "no separate checks".

                 few places (like CA) seem to be completely against the

                 separated before you even say anything. Often the
                 waiter/waitress will ask "How would you like the check

            You will find that charge in a lot of countries, especially
            around the Mediterranean. We have that cost in America too,
            but it is rolled up in the price of the food. In many
            countries laws require that service be a separate charge from
            the food. The logic being the server, dishwasher, busboy, etc
            are not involved in the making of the food so the restaurant
            can not legally include their cost in the food. Other
            countries may not have a law requiring it but restaurants
            still break out the charge out of tradition. Whether the
            charge is rolled up in the food price or broken out separately
            the total bill is still going to be the same price. If you
            think its an unnecssary charge, its only because its an
            itemized charge you can see. In America its out of sight out
            of mind. Hopefully you did not tip American style. In Greece
            tipping is not obligatory and done for good service, typically
            10%.

                 It just looks idiotic on the receipt and feels like I'm
                 being drachma'd (now euro'd) to death. It's like paying

       how do they charge you for not finishing food on your plate? I paid
       for the meal, if i wanted to walk it to the restroom and flush it
       down the toilet, I would do so and would not pay a cent extra.

            Kinda makes sense at buffets. Not a policy I would introduce
            if I owned one, though.

                 I can see buffets charging for excessive waste, but what
                 if the portion you took is simply bad, or not to your
                 liking?

                      I once worked with a gentleman who was on the Atkins
                      diet. At the pizza buffet, he would scrap off all
                      the toppings, eat them and leave all the crust to
                      throw away. Very embarrasing.

       I have over 15 years in the industry as a bartender/mixologist. In
       California, this IS an industry standard. Not an occasional rule,
       but a standard. If you order a "normal" mixed drink, it is either a
       1.25 or 1.5 oz pour, depending on the establishment. A "$rocks"
       pour or "$neat" pour (this is how the modifier button looks in the
       computer interface, means that the bartender pours 2 oz. A $martini
       pour usually means a 3 oz pour, often for $2-3 more.
       I know that the customer is always supposed to be right, but not in
       this case. This is just flat out ignorance and stupidity when they
       complain about this. The irony is that they are actually the ones
       benefiting from this, NOT the house. For example, let's say you buy
       a Johnnie Walker Blue label as a standard pour for $40. That's 1.5
       ounces for $40 or $26.67 per ounce. Then you order a Johnnie Walker
       Blue label $neat for $40 plus the $2 upcharge. Thats 2 ounces for
       $42 or $21.00 per ounce. The CUSTOMER is getting a better deal.
       Obviously, most people don't order the $40 shot, but consider that
       most spirits poured neat are in the $20+ range, your "savings" will
       usually be in the 18-20% range by ordering the $neat or $rocks
       pour. It's math people. The math you said you would never need
       again.
       You are getting 33% more product for $2. The only way you get
       cheated is if the product you are buying costs less than $6. If you
       are drinking a $4 spirit "neat" then you are some classy dude
       drinking Barton's from a plastic cup?!
       Please use logic and think about what you complain about before you
       air it out online. Articles like this vilify people that are
       actually doing YOU a favor. #emperorsnewclothes

               o Mike
                 Nope. Not high. Go to any bar and order a Lagavulin or
                 Johnnie Blue or Remy XO - the spirits that are ordered
                 "neat". Although you might find these for $12-15 at a
                 dive bar, any restaurant or higher end bar will charge
                 $20+ for the shot. So many of you are saying that this
                 mark up is crazy and that bars are ripping people off
                 because "I can buy a bottle for that price" type of
                 mentality. Once again, you need to be knowledgeable about
                 the business before you draw your guns and start firing
                 away. For simple minds, this is how it may seem. However,
                 you must take in many factors and variables that go into
                 your one drink. Many bars have live bands or singers as
                 entertainment. Factor that into the price. One place I
                 worked only used Riedel magnum glassware. We are talking
                 about glasses that cost $10-25 EACH. Consider that you
                 lose a percentage every day to theft and/or breakage.
                 Factor that in. The nicer the establishment, the more
                 employees they will staff. Get where this is going? You
                 can't just say that the markup is ridiculous without
                 taking in the big picture.
                 I think the lowest I'm ever seen a shot of JW Blue was
                 $27 at a beach bar in Hermosa Beach. Most establishments
                 will charge $30-40. There are roughly 12-13 neat-shots in
                 a bottle that cost $225 plus tax. So each shot will cost
                 the house $17-19. They are selling it with a 200% mark
                 up. You all say that the mark up is absurd, but ONCE
                 again it's shouting out before you do the math. A 200%
                 mark up is completely reasonable and a standard in every
                 business. If you want to complain about something,
                 complain about the restaurants that mark up their bottles
                 of wine by 300-400%. #logicisgreat
                 Back to the main issue here. The argument isn't about
                 whether or not you should validate paying $40 for a
                 single shot. Hell, we have a cocktail that costs $500 on
                 our menu that has Louis XIII in it. My argument is that
                 many people, like this author, make erroneous claims that
                 they are getting ripped off - being charged $2 for no
                 reason. This is all a matter of semantics. If you order a
                 spirit "neat", you are saying to the
                 bartender/mixologist, "I'd like this poured straight,
                 with a heavier pour, and a $2 upcharge". There is no
                 problem with asking for a spirit with no ice. You will
                 get the smaller pour, and not be charged the $2 fee. This
                 would be like buying a plane ticket and saying "I want
                 first class", then complaining about the price of the
                 ticket. And your response would be "I just meant that I
                 wanted to be treated FIRST CLASS, not that I wanted to
                 pay for the extra amenities!". If you order a "vodka
                 martini" it is going to cost $2-3 more because you are
                 GETTING A BIGGER POUR.
                 In your defense, it is the onus of the server to make
                 this all clear to the customer at the point of sale. I'm
                 sure many stupid bartenders just say things like "I don't
                 know why it's more, it just is". However, some of us are
                 not idiots and can explain the math and rationale behind
                 this industry standard. My comments aren't meant to hate
                 on people for not knowing this. My grief is towards the
                 author who has exhibited pour journalism and didn't
                 research his topic before he spewed out his opinion.

                 Are you seriously recommending that a business give away
                 more product for free because YOU (never worked there,
                 analyzed the profit margins of said product, have a cost
                 analysis spreadsheet in front of you) THINK that they are
                 making enough money already? Are you absurd? If I went to
                 a Best Buy to get a television, and said I wanted a 42
                 inch screen, but would only pay for a 40, you would say
                 "I'm sorry, the 42 inch costs more sir." To which, you
                 are suggesting Best Buy just GIVE me a larger television

            With delivery charge, you're paying for the hourly rate
            (granted, sub-minimum, but still there) and things like
            worker's comp. insurance that the restaurant has to pay the
            driver (who isn't needed for carry-out orders). The tip is to
            cover the gas to get to your door. Maybe they should add the
            costs of the employee plus their gas into the price and offer
            a discount for carryout, but you're talking about an extra $5
            to $10 per order when all added up, which is a little
            different than the types of charges talked about in the
            article, and probably wouldn't be received as well by
            customers.

       It's funny how many people are responding to this article with
       serious attitude and saying that they own a restaurant and have to
       charge extra for these things to make a profit. I haven't heard
       anyone (including the author) say restaurants shouldn't charge for
       all of their costs plus a fair profit. What I'm seeing suggested is
       that restaurants should do what almost all other businesses do and
       include all of those costs into the pricing of their products
       instead of trying to nickel and dime their customer with extra
       charges on top of the actual menu items purchased.
       Also, the "It' s my place and I'll do things the way I want, not
       the way the customer wants" attitude shown in many posts
       undoubtedly has more to do with why a lot of these owners are

            Owning a business doesn't mean you don't have any bosses,

       As a professional cook, I agree with up charges for split plates.
       Servers rarely plate food, maybe desserts, but in most cases all
       food is plated by cooks and chefs. That being said, when we have 15
       tables worth of orders and split plates come in, on top of all the
       other special requests we frequently deal with, it slows
       production. People donât seem to realize that the special requests
       they make add time to their wait. It is never just one or two
       people that ask for something special, so we have to keep track of
       every nit picky thing people want. Also, we donât view the split
       plate thing as âsharing food.â We see it as you being too cheap
       order your own entrees. Splitting an appetizer or dessert that is
       one thing; splitting an entrÃ©e is just cheap. My last job didn't
       even allow split plates unless we were slow. The chef just told
       them no, and the servers brought them an extra plate. The
       restaurant industry is non-stop, hard work; we rarely get
       complimented or thanked. We just keep hearing complaints from
       people who donât appreciate the amount of time and work it takes to
       put out their meals. I'm in the industry for two reasons, because I
       love food and enjoy letting people take a day off from cooking so
       they can spend time with people they care about. This often
       requires me to sacrifice time with the people I care about and to
       work holidays. So, please, give us break.

                 Agree. This is the way I've always seen this handled. At
                 most, if one person doesn't order at all and wants to
                 split with someone else, the item will arrive on its own
                 plate, and two empty plates come along with it.
                 I have never once seen a restaurant physically separate
                 an order.

                      Believe it or not, at the restaurant I work, people
                      do not want to separate their own sometimes.
                      Especially, if it is a difficult dish to separate
                      like a lasagna. They would rather the kitchen do it
                      and bake each half separately. I give them the
                      choice to do this on their own for free or pay the
                      share charge, which also includes an extra salad.

                 That is an EXCELLENT idea. Saves everyone time and hassle
                 and the customers can share away! When my husband and I
                 go out to dinner with our sons, we often all share with
                 each other what is on our plate and we all order
                 something different. It's a lot of fun and then we all
                 can try four different things. We just share amongst
                 ourselves not expecting the staff to split our plates up
                 that is just silly.

            Also, you get complimented and thanked by CUSTOMERS COMING IN
            TO YOUR ESTABLISHMENT. If you think it's 'too much trouble' to
            split a plate I suggest you not be in the restaurant business
            and stop moaning and complaining about what the CUSTOMER
            wants!! Sheesh.

            Do you know how many times my wife and I have gone out to eat
            but neither of us were very hungry? We went out to eat just to
            get out of the house not bc we wanted to go to eat. While you
            call it cheap, I call it smart. Why would we order two
            entree's when we will not finish them both- that I would call
            a waste. Many times we order just 1 entree bc we are not
            really that hungry we just wanted to get out of the house, and
            neither of us like wasting food. I will say though we just ask
            for an extra plate and have never asked for the cook to split
            the meal.

            I disagree about splitting entrees because we're too cheap to
            pay for our own. My husband and I split all the time because
            otherwise the portions are too big for just one person to
            eat..and my husband doesn't like leftovers. Even when we were
            on per diem and had $40 each to spend on the meal, we split it
            because the entrees were too big. And no one has ever split it
            up in the kitchen. the server always just brings an extra
            plate.

                 Absolutely agree. There's no reason why I would buy more
                 food than I actually want. Dani may think that her food
                 is so awesome that just being there is an honor, but
                 sometimes I just want dinner.
                 If it's an occasional dinner out, I don't mind bringing
                 home leftovers for the next day, but what if we're
                 travelling? When we're eating out every night for a week
                 or two, the portions are so overwhelming you can't even
                 look forward to it, and there's no way to do leftovers in
                 a hotel room. Sometimes we'll just order appetizers
                 instead of meals, but in many places, appetizers are more
                 like junk food. Splitting an entree is the sensible way
                 to go.

                 Simple fact is in many restaurants the portion sizes are
                 simply to large. I don't like waste and don't expect
                 anyone to divide my food but it's nice to have an extra
                 plate. I always tip as if we both ordered the same
                 entree. $30 for the lamb gets tipped as $60 if I split
                 the plate.
                 Easy peasy

            The folks I know who want a "split" plate don't ask the staff
            to 'split" the plate for them; they "split" the plate
            themselves at the table either by eating off the same plate or
            using one of those bread plates put on the table. They also
            don't "split" the plate because they are too cheap. It is
            often because the portions are just too large for one person,
            especially when ordering for senior citizens or young kids
            (like 6-9 yr olds) who want to order a regular meal not
            chicken nuggets.

       So it's okay for a restaurant to discourage you from bringing your
       own wine by charging a corkage fee, but it's NOT okay for a
       restaurant to discourage you from eating someone else's food by
       charging a fee for splitting the dish? What a dope! And yes, a neat
       whiskey should have more booze than one served chilled or on the
       rocks, and most sophisticated drinkers are aware of this (at least
       in my experience), so it is perfectly fine to charge more. Just
       like you would expect to pay more for the regular cut of steak than
       you would for the petite cut.

            I agree!! Everyone keeps saying it's not about the cost of the
            meal, they just don't want to waste food. So why the whining
            about a 50 cent or even $1.00 charge? And, by the way, the
            restaurant that you want to go to because you just want to get
            out of the house, or you don't feel like cooking or whatever
            is there to make a living. The owner has to pay payroll,
            insurances, utilities, rent, food costs, etc. If every table
            came in and sat for 2 hours over one plate, the restaurant
            would go out of business for sure. The server and busboy who
            need to be attentive to these customers need to get paid. And
            let me guess, keep the free water refills coming!! Let's add
            the dishwasher's pay to this list.
            Restaurants are a BUSINESS and they struggle, more often than
            not, to keep their heads above water. The cost of food rises
            every day (fuel increases, floods in Florida, every excuse in
            the book) but they cannot raise their menu prices by much or
            they lose their clientele. The profit margin shrinks every day
            (minimum wage increases, insurance costs).
            So let's fill the dining room with couples who only want to
            pay for one meal. And not ask a measly sum to help out.
            Unbelievable.

       I've encountered this, and I live in a medium-sized town in the
       Midwest, not in NYC. One of our local restaurants that we recently
       visited charged us for extra butter. We had asked for side of
       butter with our baked potatoes and were charged $0.30 per person.
       This was a casual dining restaurant, and I was shocked, but I said
       nothing to the server nor did I deduct it from her tip. I will,
       however, think twice about going to that restaurant again. It just
       seems extremely petty if you are already paying $30-$35 for lunch
       for two people.
       I've also encountered two local fast food places (both chains) that
       do this. I wanted a hamburger but to substitute a salad for the
       french fries. Both places wanted to charge approx. $1.00 extra to
       change the side. Seriously? A few bits of iceberg lettuce and a
       couple cherry tomatoes cost that much more than fries?
       Other places do try to charge $0.25 for packets of sauce (like
       Honey Mustard or BBQ) if you don't order nuggets, or if you ask for
       more than the one you are allotted. I guess that's better than
       begging for two extra ketchup packets or an extra napkin.

            The cost of a salad is at least double of the cost of the
            french fries? Why would you expect to get a more expensive
            side for the same price? I just don't get how people come up
            with this stuff. French fries don't go bad in the freezer.
            Salad ingredients do go bad. All these things have to be
            figured in to the price, or you will be going out of business
            very quickly.

       Couple issues with some of the topics in this article. First off,
       I've been bartending for 6 years at a non-franchise Irish place. We
       use a count system. One, two, three, and at three you stop the
       pour. As long as you're counting at the right speed, your pours
       will be the same in every drink, regardless if they're neat or on
       the rocks, or even in a mixed drink. We serve our neat drinks in
       the same cups as our mixed shots, whereas a drink on the rocks is
       usually put into a tumbler, unless it's a higher-shelf liquor. Same
       pour, same price, rocks or no rocks. Other places may do this
       because they pour differently. My advice is to take a brief moment
       and ask your bartender or server, provided they're not crazy busy.
       As far as the gratuties go, for anyone who thinks 20% gratuity is
       unreasonably high, I suggest you consider what our wages are. I'm
       especially lucky at my place, because I get paid $5/hr, which is
       more than double what most other servers make. Even so, every other
       paycheck is $0.00 thanks to taxes. My average check (when there's
       any money left at all) hovers around $40 -$50. When you don't tip,
       you actually COST us money, because we're still being taxed. My
       rule of thumb is if you're in a new place or don't know the
       bartender, leave a dollar per drink if the drink is under $5. Any
       higer, bump it up. At $6 a drink, $1.50 is still 30%, which puts
       you above the standard 20%. This kind of stuff gets noticed by
       bartenders. Doesn't mean we'll slide you a free drink next time,
       but we remember, and it comes back to you.
       Finally, to the guy in an earlier comment who suggested 'we should
       get a job someplace else if we don't like the pay'... It ain't
       always that simple, buddy.

       Lets see extra plate...somebody has to serve it, remove it clean it
       off & then the dishwasher has to wash it which takes 3 different
       ingredients that combined cost $170 used in a machine that costs
       thousands of dollars. That's just an extra dam plate. Extra napkins
       cost money . Credit card fees run in the 1000s of dollars per
       month. Having opened multiple restaurants (all of which are still
       open) every single last penny counts.you have to include all of
       those costs into your menu items regular price so you don't look
       like a schmuck trying to up charge for credit card fees or extra
       plates.People on the outside think its easy money, what it is is a
       game of percentages, where expansion means employment and
       contraction means letting people go. Anybody trying to run a
       successful business let alone a restaurant knows if your not
       counting your pennies them somebody else is spending them, wasting
       them or worst of all stealing them.

            If you are going to charge me for an extra plate then I'll
            spend my pennies else where. The charges you mentioned are
            excuses- is it really hard or time consuming for a waitress to
            bring another plate- really? dishes are washed by a machine
            and I find it hard to believe that it cost or takes a lot of
            time for a dishwasher (making min wage) to add another plate
            into the machine. Charging extra to bring out an extra plate
            is just plain cheap and greedy. If you want to count pennies
            that close then just server your meals on paper plates. How
            many people go out to eat just to hang out but aren't really
            hungry? If you are going to be that much of a d!(k then many
            of us will find a different place to eat. It is you who needs
            our business- as there are plenty of restaurants to choose
            from. No way would I or any of my friends pay a restaurant an
            extra charge for an extra plate- what's next are you going to
            try and charge an extra fee for silverware too?

            All the extra expenses explains why $0.15 of rice costs the
            customer $7.95.
            It takes the same amount of effort and water to run a full
            rack of dishes through the dishwasher as it does a partially
            filled rack. One serving is one serving no matter how it's
            split.
            Another pet peeve is paying extra for a child's serving.

            it is 3 or 30

       It should also be noted that during droughts and freezes where
       tomato supplies are tight, there have been times when tomatoes cost
       more per pound than the beef used in the hamburger. So sometimes
       there will be a charge for tomato on a sandwich or the tomato
       withheld unless you request it.

       It's obvious that the writer has never worked in a restaurant.
       Extra charge for condiments in fast food makes sense. People stock
       up on their own personal home supplies on the back of fast food
       chains. Sugar and sugar substitute packets and ketchup packets are
       big drawers for people who want to restock their home supplies -
       and chicken nugget sauces. People are unbelievable in their demands
       for nugget sauces - even for five piece ones. Charging extra for
       some of these supplies is not bad business or improper - in my
       experience it discourages home restockers and when you train your
       staff to be able to recognize 'reasonable" extras, you rarely have
       to charge for extra condiments - but having a clear policy makes it
       fair.
       I also limited supplies of these items on the condiment stand so as
       to discourage being cleaned out - and believe me - they will clean
       you out of sugar substitutes and ketchup packets. I have no problem
       with people loading up ketchup in the little plastic cups since
       that ketchup is half the price by weight of ketchup packets.
       Restaurants operate on very narrow profit margins - remember we are
       dealing with the cost of food upwards of 28-30% of the total sale
       and now the cost of labor adding nearly that much after all taxes
       and benefits added. In fast food you are happy with a 10% net
       profit on a great sales week - average of 5% when sales are tight.

       When Wendys first came to my town, it was not that much of a hit.
       Their first unit failed miserably. Why? Ala carte charges. I
       remember how mad my dad got the first time we went down there as a
       family. We had been raised going about once every couple weeks to
       McDonalds and on most Tuesdays at A&W (the real one). A kid got a
       hamburger, small fries, and orange soda for about $2. On Tuesday at
       A&W, the coneys were 25 cents. Dad would let us order as large of a
       frosty mug of rootbeer as we wanted but we only got one order. But
       we could order three or four coneys.
       Ok, why did he hate Wendy's so much. Well I can remember it like it
       was yesterday. You ordered your basic burger then they asked if you
       wanted everything on it. So your basic burger was $2. Then every
       additional item was 10 cents. So a $2 burger quickly became $3. Dad
       got the receipt was absolutely livid. We never, ever went back to
       Wendy's as a family ever again. I did not know they had changed
       that until roughly 20 years later when I started going back to get
       frosties and baked potatoes. Imagine the damage they did to
       themselves for that ala carte policy?

            As a former corporate Wendy's manager, that never was ever the
            policy - some franchise may have charged extra for toppings,
            but that was never a Wendy's policy with one exception -
            tomatoes. I date back to 1981 and at that time tomatoes did
            cost extra - and so did cheese - when back was added a year or
            so later, that became an extra topping. But I can emphatically
            defend Wendy's - that was never a corporate policy - maybe in
            some urban areas where costs to operate are outrageous, but
            I've never heard of such a thing and I had nearly 20 years
            with the company.
            I left Wendy's in 1997 and now will refuse to eat there
            because the quality and service is horrible and every product
            that I loved when I worked for them has been ruined -
            everything from the burgers, the buns, the frostys (which
            should never be anything but chocolate) to those disgusting
            fries. So I have no reason to defend Wendy's other than
            corporate restaurants are run differently than franchises - I
            know - I went to work for a franchise for a couple of months
            and they know it all - they think they can do their own thing
            and they don't even follow procedures that I knew like the
            back of my hand (I was a training store manager).

            there since about 1980. I have yet to have any of their stores

       To answer the "why charge extra for catsup but not for mustard or
       mayo," obviously the answer is that mustard and mayo are not a
       vegetable. Remember? Reagan's wonderfully brilliant administration
       declared catsup a 'vegetable' for the purposes of claiming that
       school lunches were 'balanced nutrition.' As for other fees.....I
       think charging for tap water is the most clsssless thing listed
       here. Steak sauce? Really?? In our country for most people in most
       places, steak sauce sort of comes "with" whether you use it or not,
       so to charge extra for someone to have the option seems miserly. If
       restaurants would offer acceptable portion sizes, people wouldn't
       have to split an entree. Perhaps if they offered "half size" as an
       option (at somewhat more than half the cost of "full-sized" most
       people would simply order that. Fee built in, nobody feels ripped
       off. And $20 for corkage? OMFG thats half the price of a bottle
       (ok, I'm cheap on wine - $40 is about the norm for me when eating
       out, although for a special occasion I'll go as high as $200)

            and fill his pockets with free ketchup packets and saltines,
            and bring them home to make soup from them.
            He always seemed to have money for smokes, though.

       A really good sushi buffet in Va. Beach does the fee for leftovers
       idea. I honestly thought it was a great idea. Encouraged people to
       take what they will eat. Anything left over was simply weighed at
       the end and a nominal fee was charged. It also kept the cost of
       enterance to 12.95/person for some really good sushi.

            It's a good idea, especially for those of us raised on the
            unhealthy standard of the "clean plate club." But many sushi
            bars simply charge by the number of dishes when you're done -
            so you pay for it whether you eat it or not. I would think
            this is ample financial motivation, without penalizing you
            additionally if you realize you can't finish what you took
            (and what is therefore not fit for others/recycling). don't
            they keep a barn cat in the back alley?

            Most sushi buffets charge for uneaten rice. Because otherwise
            some people would eat loads of the fish only, which would far
            exceed the price of the buffet. I understand and agree with
            this. I don't agree with weighing your leftover plate and
            forcing you to pay extra, especially if it's not strictly
            sushi.

       Along the bagel lines, there's the same type of law in California
       about sandwiches.
       Go into Subway, decline to have your food toasted, and as long as
       there are no other hot parts of the sandwich (bacon, meatballs, or
       the like), it's not taxed, as deli food is not taxed.
       Get your sandwich toasted? Whoops, time to pay sales tax for a
       "prepared meal."

       This is easy. Charge more across the board for each meal and give
       "free" food (and plates) away.
       This makes one look generous.
       Or charge for each added item. This is more fair since the the
       desirer pays for the item, but feels stingier.
       Two things make people upset easily. Money and food (when they are
       hungry). Poor restaurants get hit twice.
       In my experience, the more troublesome people are worst tippers.
       They make the entire dinning experience retched. If someone starts
       with whining about this that and the other, prepare yourself to get
       stiffed.
       These folk live to complain. It is their job. You cannot fix them,
       so it is best not to try. Since they will demand all of your
       attention taking you away from other guests, it is best to ignore
       them as much as possible. This makes their job easier too since
       they have more to complain about.
       Have a code amongst management and waitstaff for these nightmares.
       Code Mixed nuts, for example. Then everyone knows the game, and
       discourage these people from coming back. They only take.
       Don't be afraid to ask them to leave; your going to lose the price
       of a meal very likely anyway.

       I disagree completely with the writer's assertion that credit card

            It's called charging more. Most companies that do mostly
            credit card transactions build it into the price of their
            goods. What I'd like to see is a discount for using cash. Some
            places do that, but most don't. I use cash where there's a
            discount. I use my debit card as a credit card where there
            isn't.

                 There are costs for processing cash (loss, counting,
                 armored car) and checks, but it's not as easy for the
                 business to quantify. Also most card processing
                 agreements prohibit charging more to use the card.

                      But they don't prohibit an owner from figuring $X

                      individual menu items sold per month (which is

                      restaurants) and adding that to the menu pricing.
                      Either way the extra amount gets added to the check,
                      but customers are much less likely to notice and

            But more importantly, the wait staff shouldn't pay the credit
            card fees, which is all too often what happens. The restaurant
            collects tips in the form of credit card promises and then
            subtracts the credit fees from the tip side of the check
            instead of the cost side of the check.
            As a consumer, you should write "cash" in the tip line of the
            credit form and then tip cash. Leaves the restaurant to pay
            the credit card charge and also apply their formula to what
            the server should be taxed. As a customer, I always tip big
            and in cash to insure my server gets 100% of the tip and the
            employer has no friggin' clue as to what I tipped.

            charging the consumer the credit card fee could have benefits-
            like making the consumer aware that it cost money to use that
            card and perhaps more people would revert back to cash instead
            of spending that extra fee. I doubt it would have a big
            impact, but anything that keeps people from using plastic
            rather than cash is a good thing. Just think of how many
            people are still paying interest on that cheeseburger they ate

            lots of places actually make the servers pay for credit card
            fees. the system automatically takes a percentage of credit
            card tips out on the checkout. another reason not tipping
            actually causes servers to lose money. especially on takeout
            orders. if you're tipping out based on sales, you get hit
            there on togo orders who don't tip. then, if they pay with a
            credit card. then the time and effort it takes to put
            everything together... be nice to your servers. they see some
            of the worst in society on a nightly basis, and many states do
            only pay $2.13. that includes, in many cases, taking out your
            garbage, cleaning the bathroom after you pee on the
            seat/floor, having disgusting fluids splashed into their
            faces... some of you people are really unbelievable.

                 We get that it is a bad system. But, the question is if
                 it is such a bad system why are people working in/with
                 it? If the credit card fees are being taken out of the
                 tip, then the employer is screwing the workers. Why
                 should the customers step in to compensate for that? Now
                 you want people to tip on "to go" orders? How about
                 people just come by, on their way home, to give money to
                 the waitstaff, huh?
                 - $2.13 wage
                 - taxes held on an assumed 20% tip on the total sales
                 - 7% automatic tip-out to the bussers
                 - credit card fees being taken out of the tip amount
                 - no overtime pay
                 .
                 .
                 . the list goes on...
                 WHY do you work in this profession?? Fight the system,
                 fight the employer but don't demand that the customers
                 take care of you. The customer has an agreement with the
                 establishment to pay the cost of the food and the tax.
                 That's it. Rest, such as the tip %, manner of tip
                 payment, tip on the check amount or pre-tax, no tip on
                 to-go orders etc are at the DISCRETION of the customer.

                      establishments pay them a decent wage and pass it as

                      less than the 20% of the check amount. So far, no
                      one has been able to give a rational answer as to
                      why it should be a climbing percentage or that it
                      should even be a percentage. Anyone who screws up
                      their nose at a, say 15% tip on a $100 check is the
                      one who is creating a bad name for all in that
                      profession. Waiting IS a real job. It is just NOT a

                      The point is not that we shouldn't be compassionate

                      is that just one seemingly low paying, tough
                      profession alone cannot be nursed by other people.
                      Compassion is one thing and demand that you pay a
                      certain amount because they took a low paying job is
                      another. The waitstaff complain about how bad it is

                      instead of fighting with them for a change, they are
                      pushing the customers to compensate. I'm all for

                      that people give them. If paying them fed min wage
                      pushes the price of the food, so be it. But, it
                      cannot be "they don't pay me well. So, you HAVE TO
                      pay me at least 20% of the check amount". That's
                      ridiculous. Social responsibility should be towards
                      ALL people whose wages are low and are providing a
                      service. So, let's start tipping McDonald's workers,
                      the garbage collectors, the street sweepers etc. I'm
                      sure garbage collection is much more strenuous a
                      job.

       I HATE mayonnaise. I explicitly asked that my sandwich NOT have
       mayonnaise. It came with mayonnaise. (I don't even like the smell.)
       Okay, it happens. I nicely asked for two new slices of white bread.
       They came. Charge: 30 cents. Okay, I took the mayonnaisey pieces of
       bread and left them face down on the table. Not a graceful moment,
       but really? 30 cents?

       On the second thought, they can charge extra for anything they
       want. The question is if it is good for business. If the restaurant
       wants return business, I can't imagine it would be worth their
       while to annoy customers with petty charges. On the other hand, I
       don't think a fast food place on a busy street, or a hotel in Vegas
       cares about return business, so they would charge you for ketchup,
       napkins and a glass of water, because the idea is to siphon as much
       money out of you as possible on your one an only visit there.

            In most countries pay restrooms are well-worth the charge.
            They are clean, even sparkling, well-lighted, and convenient.
            When I was a boy the train station in my town had pay toilets.
            It is not a new idea, and not one that has never been tried in

                 You have no idea what you are saying, obviously. At
                 least, that's what I'm hoping and that it's just your
                 lack of understanding of how the restaurant industry
                 works that has led you to post such a cruel and miserly
                 statement. Servers make 2.13 an hour and work their asses
                 off to please their "guests" so they can use that 20
                 percent that you OWE them for rent, groceries, tuition,
                 children, or whatever other expenses that that person
                 might have. As for getting another job if they don't like
                 it, look around at the unemployment rate; look around at
                 the people living off government handouts instead of
                 working at all. Is that what servers should do? Don't be
                 a fool. Restauarnt employees are some of the hardest
                 working people around. Sure, there are always exceptions
                 to the rule. Not all doctors and lawyers work hard enough
                 for what they are paid, either, but we don't stiff them.
                 You should be ashamed of yourself. If you've ever gotten
                 bad service in a restaurant, it's because a jackass like
                 you came in just before you, jackass, and ruined your
                 servers day. Now you know. Ps. Almost every server and
                 bartender I have ever known was also a student and needed
                 a flexible job that offered mostly evening hours to work
                 around busy class schedules. They work hard, much harder
                 than you have probably ever worked in your life, and they
                 DESERVE 20 percent or MORE. Don't be a fool and spread
                 your foolish words. And, until you learn how to take care
                 of people, you aren't welcome in ANY restaurant. Cook for
                 yourself, you lazy jackass.

                      Ahh.. another misguided fool, I see. No one OWES the
                      waiter 20% for the rent, groceries etc. I agree that
                      they are very hard working but so are many in other
                      professions. Just because those people aren't
                      customer facing, it doesn't mean that they deserve
                      any less. So, if the establishment wants to pay them
                      a higher wage and jack up the food prices, sure, let
                      them go for it. The customer's contract is with the
                      establishment. It is NOT with the waiter. So, if the
                      customer covers the check amount, including the
                      taxes, then he has upheld his part of the contract
                      and therefore doesn't have to stay home and cook for
                      himself/herself. Anything beyond the check amount is
                      charity and it has to be at the discretion of the
                      customer. That said, the customer is not superior
                      and the waiter inferior because of the said business
                      relationship between the two. The customer should
                      not and doesn't get to treat the waitstaff badly.
                      So, either champion for the employers to pay the
                      waitstaff the fed. min. wage or have the
                      establishment tack on a 20% "seated" surcharge or
                      have them display a notice at the door that unless
                      the customer is willing to pay 20% tip, he/she is
                      not welcome. Otherwise, I say that you should be
                      quiet.

       No, contrary to what the author says, surcharge for bread and
       butter is not justified, and it hurts restaurant business. Sure,
       bread costs money, but its $3 tops for a whole three-foot long
       baguette if you buy retail, whereas the restaurant will charge you
       this amount for three-four two-inch slices. So, the customers feel
       gouged and won't return and rightly so.

       When we were given the wrong meal (both my wife and I) at Rudy's
       Teller House restaurant in Silverton, CO they brought out a second
       dish..then proceeded to charge us for both the incorrect one and
       the correct one. The owner came out (without us asking - he wasn't
       present when we ordered) and proceeded to tell us that we needed to
       order correctly next time, and he would be charging us the full
       amount for both. When I replied he walked away and flipped me off.
       Then...they added 18% tip to the ticket...then they added $6 for an
       empty plate that my twins used to split the adult meal that we got
       for them (just an empty plate with the meal).
       I've been a waiter. That was a crazy bad experience. I feel sorry
       for the employees that are there and for anyone that is unlucky
       enough to find their way into the store. I paid cash so he couldn't

                 I was ticked off enough that I posted reviews everywhere
                 I could think of. So rude, and to think the owner is the
                 one that was acting like that. I confirmed with the
                 waiter that he was the owner because I just couldn't
                 believe it. What really ticked me off is he came out when
                 we had the meal corrected and I thought he was just
                 coming out to see if everything was alright...then he
                 started with a chip on his shoulder addressing my wife! I
                 nearly voted with my foot in another way. It's when I
                 stood up to talk to him that he walked away and flipped
                 me off.
                 Btw - the twins that were splitting the adult meal where
                 we only needed a second plate - 2 years old. We weren't

            Customers ultimately determine the efficacy of policies - if
            you are mistreated then you should never go back. Even if you
            did order the wrong thing or forgot, a proficient restaurant
            will want your repeat business and will seek to earn it by not
            treating you like you were treated. How a wrong order is
            handled by staff tells you a lot about how a restaurant is run
            - and if they'll screw you and blame you (even if it really
            was your fault), just imagine how their procedures for food

            I have to take the other side here. If you ordered something
            without understanding what you were getting you should pay for
            it. I've gone to many restaurants with menus that have minimal
            quantity - that doesn't mean I refuse to pay for what I order.
            Which one of Wolfgang's restaurants set you off? I've been to
            most of his in Las Vegas and have had great experiences. In
            June I hosted a group of 4 at a steakhouse for about a $700
            bill (including 20% tip). In my opinion, if you aren't willing
            to pay for the restaurant or accept their offerings don't
            bother to go. You actions, after agreeing to order the salad
            at the list price, was absolutely unacceptable!

       I don't eat regularly at restaurants, however, I want to know what

       charged a 20% tip without anywhere on the restaurant or menu
       indicating that extra charge. By mistake I added another 20% tip; I
       took them to court and made them pay a fine, court costs and other
       expenses.
       Again, ONCE I KNOW WHAT I AM BEING CHARGED, IT IS UP TO ME TO

       There's a bagel place in my hometown that I won't go to anymore
       because of a strange pricing scheme. Obviously you expect that
       there's a price difference between a plain (uncut) bagel vs a bagel
       toasted with butter vs a bagel toasted with cream cheese. But if
       you order a toasted bagel with cream cheese AND butter, they charge
       you an extra $0.50 for the butter! I mean c'mon, I'm already paying
       you to cut and toast the bagel, along with the charge for cream
       cheese, but seriously, $0.50 to smear some butter on it before the
       cream cheese goes on? I was shocked when I went with my family of
       four and paid an extra $2 just to add butter! So I just don't go

            This makes sense to me. Most people don't get both butter and
            cream cheese so of course the price of the bagel with cream
            cheese is more than butter (since cream cheese is more
            expensive than butter) but does not include the butter. So you
            have to pay more for both. If you were at lunch and could
            order a chicken sandwich plain, with cheese for an extra
            charge, or with bacon for an extra charge, wouldn't it make
            sense that the extra charge would be more if you wanted both
            cheese and bacon?

                 My point is that butter is usually a free condiment, at
                 least in my part of the country - totally different from
                 cheese or bacon. I can understand charging more for the
                 labor of cutting and toasting a bagel, but when you've
                 already paid for that labor as part of the "with cream
                 cheese" option, you don't expect to be charged for that
                 labor a second time. It's just a very unusual practice
                 from what I've seen in my neck of the woods.

       I happen to own a restaurant. I do not do most of these things,
       however somethings I do. Most if not all of the things you mention
       effect the restaurant's bottom line... yes even giving extra
       ketchup. The bottom line is I don't walk in to your office and say
       "how dare you charge me X amount of dollars for your service"
       Either I want it or I don't. My point is you don't know what goes
       into someone's bottom line. If someone needs to charge a plate
       charge I'm sure its not because they are trying to rip you off but
       there is an opportunity cost lost. Each seat to is like real estate
       and you're not entitled to sit there unless you are spending money.
       Butter & bread costs money. If it is not something that is offered
       (and believe me if its offered you're paying for it because it will
       be worked in to your entree's cost) you should be getting charged
       for it. If there is a different charge for rocks and neat there is
       probably difference in the pour size. Liquor is charged by the
       ounce. Neat at one ounce is a shot, most people find this to be not
       enough, yet one ounce on the rocks looks very different. One and a
       half ounces on a neat pour make most customer's satisfied hence the
       more money. Im sure if you asked for a shot in a neat glass you'll
       be charged appropriately. This article is insulting and misleading.
       You are spouting off gripes without having done research and show a
       blatant disregard for someone elses bottom line.

            Then these extra charges should be clearly listed, on a board,
            OUTSIDE the joint so folks can decide if they want to pay it
            or not. Simple. Folks don't like it, they'll go someplace

            And that is why I do not go to restaurants: it is all about
            the bottom line. Restaurants are taking advantage of America's
            lazy ways where it is easier to eat out than to cook at home.
            Automatically charging a gratuity so you can pay your
            employees less is a disgrace. I can understand fair and
            reasonable charges, but the industry is taking it to an
            extreme.
            Here in New Zealand, the price you see on the menu is what you
            pay. Tax is included, all workers wages are included and there
            are no surprises.
            Still, the solution is to cook at home: healthier, cheaper and
            less stressful than any restaurant.

            This is overly long MEB - sorry. But MEB, this is about
            customer service and the impression it leaves. Incorporate the
            costs into the menu prices so they are less noticeable.
            Add-ons annoy people and cause them to not want to return
            (this article is only a reflection of that). And BTW - I know
            what it takes to put a plate on a table. Too many restaurant
            owners think they sell food - that their product is food. It
            actually isn't. You are selling, even at the diner level, an
            experience. It might be a common experience or an
            extraordinary one. Each of those have different value - each
            has it's place. If you think you are selling food, well, you
            can't compete. I can eat for less at home and in fact likely
            healthier. Further, I bet a few of my dishes blow away
            anything your place has (a guess of course - but a safe one
            for me I think). Yet, I may still go to your restaurant. Why?
            Because it is not simply about food. It's about an experience.
            A social experience, maybe (but not necessarily) a great
            culinary experience, an experience of convenience, (even) an
            experience of culture (like the M&M Soul Cafe in Vegas as an
            example), or what have you. If it is a positive experience I
            will return. If it is not, I will not - and add-ons are a
            negative experience for me. There is a restaurant across the
            street I never go to anymore. 4 out of 6 of a breakfast party
            I was with (not myself) got rather ill on the eggs one day
            (over easy only common item). That is not why I do not go
            there. I don't go there because I went back the next day and
            told them about the issue (politely) and instead of an apology
            for my bad experience I was informed they are not responsible
            if folks choose to eat undercooked eggs (which they gladly
            serve). I wasn't asking for anything. If they had said sorry
            and promised to look into it I would eat there now. But, I
            wouldn't eat filet minon there now if it were free. They sold
            me a bad experience. Add-ons are also a bad experience. You
            own a restaurant. When you make the customer an enemy or
            adversary - you may as well hang it up.

            associated fees. That way custoemrs do not feel like they're
            being taken for a ride.
            And as a business owner, you clealry described and defined the
            business aspect of your operation. However, you need to
            include marketing and building goodwill as part o fyour
            business strategy. No one will know or care that your entrees
            are $2-$3 dollars higher but customer will remember that you

       a great deal of money there that night buying bottles of wine and
       sampling everything on the menu. They never told us about the fee
       when we asked them to cut the cake and at the end of the meal we

       My family been in the restaurant industry since the 80's and there
       was charges that we imposed on customers bill which had decent
       amount of feedback on it since. I'm currently running an Japanese
       Steakhouse where the chef comes and cook at the table. We add an
       18% service charge which is stated on every single page of the menu
       and on the receipt for a party of 6 or more. Reason for us to do
       this is server usually get paid a very low hourly rate $2+ which
       ours being much higher than industry standard. The server make a
       living off tips and i would hate to see my hard working server
       getting cheated of a tip from a big party. It happened many times
       so we add it as a standard. Also teppanyaki chefs also makes a
       living off tips and they and the server shares the same tip
       equally. This practice was frown upon by a local food critic which
       to me seem ridiculous. Sure, there is special circumstances where
       the service is tremendously horrible which customer doesn't feel
       the need to tip. Most the time when this does happen, customer
       would refuse to pay for the whole entire meal. From personal
       experience, those customers are the one that always try to cheat
       restaurant out of a free meal. For me if i go somewhere where
       service is horrible, i will still tip because they make a living
       off it but i won't tip as much and won't come back again. We also
       do a sharing up charge on the grill. We feel that is fair because
       the chef now have to cook for extra people and they get extra side
       of soup and salad for just $5 but some customers just feel like
       they are cheated.

       THe list is wide and absurd (I agree with the author). I've been to
       places where they tried to pull this on me. When the bill arrives I
       tell the waiter "no". They can take it off the bill or I will take
       it off their tip. If I go to a group meal and the waiter is
       atrocious - time to call the manager. He can either discount the
       meal or take off the 20%. There are ways to handle things. If the
       person tells me in ADVANCE then that is a different story - but I
       do not subscribe to surprise billing. I have been to restaurants
       where I ordered food, then when I asked for something and they
       wanted to tack a stupid fee (the ketchup happened once) I told them
       I could either get the ketchup, or I leave (with the food on the
       table, and me not paying the bill). The ketchup arrived.
       Well run restaurants can make great profit - you don't have to rip

            As a server i am 100% behind the 20% automatic tip for a
            group. Most groups never arrive on time and take longer to
            serve then say 5 or 6 tables of 4. This means the tables dont
            turn over and we dont make money. Also we are counting on the
            table to tip . Sometimes the bill is paid by one person and we
            can get stiffed very easily. I served a group one night of 16
            one night and they asked for the manager , The praised my
            service and said everything was fantastic. An older woman took
            the bill for the entire table and left no tip. Not only did
            they tie up a large portion of my section all night but i
            still had to tip out to the restaurant $12.00. So i lost money
            out of my own pocket to serve them. Put the 20% on all bills
            and if you are truly unhappy see the manager.

                 I totally agree with you! Large parties take much longer
                 to serve and from my experience longer to even take their
                 order. I could serve 4 tables of 4 faster than 1 large
                 party of 16. Also, even if they aren't taking up your
                 whole section, you may need to pass some tables off to
                 other servers to properly serve such a large group. Now
                 you have less tables and less tip opportunity. I do
                 believe that the surcharge for large parties should be
                 clearly stated on the menu and customers should
                 definitely be advised of any additional charges for
                 special requests. The only bad experience I've had being
                 charged a fee was at a Denny's. I was in my early 20's-20
                 yrs ago- at the time. I ordered coffee and while drinking
                 it the cup slipped out of my hand and onto a small bread
                 type plate. The plate broke. Our server came over, saw
                 what happened and took the pieces away. we all made light
                 of my slippery fingers lol and finished our meal. When we
                 got the check there was a $5 charge for the plate. I was
                 shocked. $5 seemed extremely expensive for a plain white
                 6" restaurant plate. I could have understood it if I had
                 been being rowdy and horsing around and the plate broke
                 but it simply slipped out of my fingers dues to the
                 handle being wet. I refused to pay it and was told I was
                 "banned" from that Denny's.

                 always leaving enough to cover the cost of their meal but
                 little or nothing for the tip and disappearing before the
                 bill arrives. We're all professionals and make decent
                 money, so those left always throw in enough for a good
                 tip ... but I could see where large groups that run up a
                 $600 bill are too cheap throw in another $120 for the
                 service after tying up three tables for hours. Without
                 that mandatory 18%, the server would get stiffed more
                 often than not.
                 Still, I've seen 20% mandatory gratuities listed for
                 groups as small as six. That is just ridiculous.

                      And itâs YOUR decision to eat there. Itâs totally
                      unrealistic to think that all employees agree with
                      the rules and procedures set forth by their
                      managers, regardless of where they work. Do you
                      agree with all the rules you were forced to abide
                      by, by your employer? Probably not. But sometimes,
                      whether or not you agree with them, you have to just
                      go with it, or you risk losing your job, which most
                      of us canât afford to do. But the majority of the
                      time, the servers have NO CONTROL over most of these
                      issues, nor are they even aware that they exist half
                      the time. If you truly have an issue with something,
                      man up, and take it to an owner/manager, instead of
                      taking it out on the server!

                      justathought, facts remain, if I don't like my job,
                      I can get another one as well. just as the waiter or
                      waitress can find a different job if they don't like
                      where they work, not my fault they don't like their
                      job. charging me for something that is not listed as
                      having a price on the menu, or charging extra for
                      something the waiter or waitress did not tell me
                      about is robbery. without something listed on the
                      menu, for all I know, the restaraunt could charge me
                      for ANYTHING they wish. I guess in the same sense
                      though, when they try to do that to me, I could
                      always say I charge "x" amount to dine here, then
                      tell the manager/owner to stick it.

            I agree with furby, list everything on the menu that costs, if
            it's not there, it shouldn't be charged, and the waiter or
            waitress can take the issue up with the manager or owner.
            while the waiter or waitress may feel upset, they can deal
            with it on their own, not the customer fault the restaurant is
            trying to slip charges in.

       most of these just seem whiney, and being a chef i'd like to weigh
       in about the sauce point. Just for shits and giggles let's say the
       steak house is serving a demi glace. That's a TWO DAY process
       starting with putting up a nice roasted veal stock overnight, then
       pulling, reducing, skimming, and fortifying the sauce. So if you
       want more than what i've costed this plate out for, then hell yes
       you are going to pay a little extra for it.
       "special" butters as well. dairy is expensive enough and making a
       nice compound butter to top your steak takes labor.
       Everything in a restaurant costs the restaurant money, if you want
       more than what has been costed out to be served you should expect
       to pay more. If I have a consultation with a lawyer for an hour,
       and want to add extra time, should I expect that to be free?

            But when you buy an entire strip to cut 10 steaks, at a cost
            of $4-5/lb., and charge $25 for 8oz, it seems like extra sauce
            would fit into that budget. The margin on most restaurant
            plates is 60%, which means you should be able to compensate
            for extra demi glace.

            You said that you are a chef. Doubtful that your restaurant
            will survive. While I fully understand the effort and expense
            of food, supplies, overhead, labor and utilities, I price
            based upon an average consumer. If a customer wants a little
            extra sauce, butter or mushrooms, I may lose a small amount of
            margin, but the goodwill and a repeat customer is worth more
            to me. If the number of extra requests increases, then adjust
            the base price of the food. Duhh. It is no wonder that there
            is a continuing market for the Robert Irvine's of the world

       The reality is that nothing in a restaurant can be free - not even
       the bathrooms, because all of these things cost the owner real
       money. Americans have long been accustomed to "bundled" pricing, in
       airlines ("free" checked bags and meals) restaurants ("free" bread
       and coffee refills). In other parts of the world, unbundled pricing
       is more common. Bundled pricing typically leads to higher consumer
       prices since people use the "free" goods and services whether or
       not they would otherwise have purchased them.

            The only problem with that analysis is the unbundled price
            does not decrease the cost of the entree. The bundled price is
            the baseline and then the additional condiments/services are
            added to the charge. It is a cost always added to, but never
            taken from. The answer is, do not go to predatory restaurants.

       Agree with all, except the New York bagel tax. This is not a
       special tax on "altered" bagels. This is the sales tax. As in many
       states, food purchased for preparation at home are not taxed; food
       prepared and served is taxed. Thus a bagel is not taxed, but if
       it's sliced and buttered and served, tax is charged.

            "Nothin' sets off the flavor of a steak like some ketchup!"
            Completely agree on this point. This may have been designed to
            discourage people from requesting it. I like A-1 but I'd never
            let it get close to a really nice fillet.
            You'll find similar stories with other aspects. I think I
            remember a story a while back on a place that charged extra
            for well-done steak (effectively a pay us for ruining this for

       The split plate makes sense to me. If you are sharing bites off
       each others plates it is just to try more variety of food. If you
       are getting one item, and splitting it two ways you're basically
       taking up two seats for the price of one. Restaurants don't make
       much money, they count on turn over to make what money they do. If
       every table is eating one dish split, they make half as much money.
       I can also understand if you are charged for compound butters or
       sauces that are made. These cost extra money, and take more time to
       prepare. It is different than asking for a bottle of A-1 which you
       are probably going to use just a couple of cents worth.

            A single diner would also be taking up "two seats for the
            price of one". Should they have to pay more because they are
            there alone?

       Went out to dinner at a high end restrant in Scottsdale AZ,
       Mastreo's Ocean Club. These guys just are unbelieveable. The place
       charges $4 for an 8oz soda and no free refills. Mind you the
       average plate meal is $50-60, Side dish is $12-20, mixed drinks
       start @$10...It's a shame when High end places start charging for
       every little thing. It makes them look desperate for cash and that
       they take advantage of people out for special occasions. I wouldn't
       be surprised if they start to charge for the Bread but oddly this
       time they didn't.

            Should have went to Monti's La Casa Vieja on Mill Avenue. We
            were on vacation and someone that my husband ran into while
            running up Camelback Mountain recommended it. Food was
            excellent and staff was awesome. Manager even gave us a tour
            and told us about the place. The most amazing thing about the
            tour was that it was after they closed at 11 pm. He didn't
            make us feel like we were in the way or anything. Told us to
            take our time when my daughter was reading the captions on
            some of the pix. Place dates from 1871..the building does.
            Used to be an adobe hacienda. Anyway..they there. And try
            their Roquefort salad dressing. No blue cheese for them.
            Theirs is imported from France and there is a $2.00 upcharge
            but the server told us about it when I ordered it. It was
            excellent and well worth the extra couple bucks.

       I was in Hong Kong on business around 20 years ago and went into a
       McDonald's, After I got my food, I grabbed some ketchup packets and
       napkins from the counter and turned to walk away. Complete
       pandemonium erupted. The order taker literally started screaming.
       Then her coworkers behind the counter joined in the yelling.
       Shocked, I froze and looked back at them in confusion. They
       continued hollering hysterically at me in Cantonese, while
       gesturing angrily. I had no clue what were they saying, and what to
       do. So I just stared at them. Finally, an English-speaking customer
       stepped forward and told me that condiments (including salt) and
       napkins are not free, and must be paid for. I had no idea.
       Embarrassed, the whole place staring at me, I quickly paid and
       left. And I never went back.

       (everything charged ala carte when they should know their menu) to

            I lived in Japan for a year & went to McDonald's probably once
            a month when I was missing "Western" food. I was never asked
            to pay extra for ketchup. They would just ask me how many
            packets I wanted. The thing I like about American restaurants
            vs Europe/Asia is the free refills on drinks. Yes I know it's
            bundled into the meal price but I tend to drink a lot when I
            eat regardless of what I am drinking (water, tea, pop, etc).
            When all you're given is one small 8 oz glass and charged $3+
            for it, you don't want to pay for another glass & often they
            don't offer water.

       Some places will charge you a fee or flat out refuse to let you eat
       carryout in their restaurant. Never happened to me, but I know of
       one story of somebody picking up a pizza to go, a thunderstorm
       comes pouring down so they sit down to eat and they are told they
       are not allowed to. Some lame argument about servers not getting
       tips this way. Sounds like bad business to me, especially when you
       never intended to sit down and eat, but circumstances kind of force
       your hand.

            It probably depends on what kind of place it is-if it's a
            pizza place where you basically get your slices at the counter
            and then can either sit or go, then it is wrong to charge for
            sitting. BUT, if it is a full-on sit-down restaurant with
            servers and hostesses that does carryout, then I can see why
            they wouldn't want a carryout patron to just sit at a table
            with their order-especially if there are sit-down patrons
            waiting to be seated.

       Mr. Cury, WHY is it fair to charge an automatic 20% tip onto a
       larger group? This group is going to eat a lot more than just a
       couple, for example. So if you have 15% or 18%, whatever, and you
       increase that by the amount of food eaten with a group of, say, six
       people instead of that couple, man, you're getting a much bigger
       tip. Why ad insult to injury by not just getting more money
       (because of much larger bill) but a higher percent of that, too?
       And yes, I was in the restaurant business for many years.

            There's always still a line on the bill for "tip." If the

            write a negative number on that line and subtract off the
            undeserved portion of the tip. I dare the restaurant manager
            to argue with you much about it.

            What most people do not realize is that the 20% gratuity is
            added to the total after taxes. So after taxes, it becomes
            more than 20% since in some states, tax can be as high as 10%.

                      Then you are paying tax on the tip! Either way these
                      two items (tip and tax) must be calculated
                      separately which is almost never the case. I see
                      almost everyone add tip % on top of the (total+tax)
                      which means they are tipping more than they think
                      they are. To be accurate it should be only % on

            Jim, obviously you have NEVER waited on large groups. I work
            in a resort community in the Florida panhandle. Where we are
            located, on scenic 30-A on the Emerald Coast, we have parties
            of 10 to 30+ all summer long. If you dont think that a party
            of 6 adults and 24 kids want drop you tip, you are wrong. Kids
            menu items are typically cheaper. They share. Parents order
            them a soda or only water. This drops a check drastically.
            Now, this table requires all of your time to get that many
            orders properly, refill drinks and keep up with the table. You
            now loose the option of turning your table. Believe
            me......20% is not enough. Try it sometime. Oh, and BTW.....I
            choose this line of work because i like it.

            Even worse is a growing number of places that set it up so the
            mandatory tips do not go to the servers at all, but to the
            company as if it was an item from the menu, and the servers
            only get any additional tip that is added on top of that in
            the optional section. Many states don't allow this, but if you
            think the service is bad when they know they're going to get
            20% for sure, imagine how bad the service is when they know
            the 20% doesn't go to them and the party won't tip them
            because they've already been charged once. I've done the
            negative tip thing to take off the 20% then put cash on the
            table at places that do that and haven't been charged on my cc
            yet for the mandatory tip, but i'm not sure if the server
            actually got to keep the cash.

            I worked in a 5 star hotel for many years and the stuff they
            charge is ridiculous like $8 for soda but when it comes down
            to it. The cost it takes to operate and keep a hotel that
            nice, clean, updated, trained talents gets very expensive.
            People pay for the environment. Also about that 20% service
            charge, I worked on a rooftop bar for few years and if you
            ever been a server trying to take care of a group of 30 in 110
            degree weather in a full suit while they are all getting
            intoxicated for 4 hours? and worst of it is the management
            tells you not to charge service charge on those group because
            they are VIP and looks bad and they left without leaving a
            dime because they are so intoxicated to know.
            There is good side and bad side to the service charge but in
            this industry i believe that its imposed because of those not
            tipping customers.
            I went to Korea and they don't take tip but add a mandatory
            10-15% service charge on every bill. I know a lot of

            This has been debated to death.
            Large groups ALWAYS take up a whole lot more time.
            Large groups NEVER have everyone show up on time.
            Large groups make it very easy for people not to leave tips,
            everyone "assumes" someone else is going to tip.
            Large groups always complain the most, they don't understand
            why you can't serve 20 people all exactly at the same time.

            Because your group is going to be a lot more work than the
            table of one or two, which the waiter -still- has to wait on
            in addition to your party of 6-10 (Personally I think the
            magic number is 8+, automatic gratuity). And what if the party
            doesn't leave anything? Or tips very poorly (it happens all
            the time, whether its due to the fact that they assume there's
            a gratuity already, or more likely they are cheap)? Not to
            mention that a good deal of restaurants force waiters to share
            parties and the tip coming from that party (So instead of
            getting 20 from the party you're down to 10, less if it is a
            bigger party and more waiters are required).

            Because big groups run up a $1000 bill, and then decide that
            $200 is way too much to tip a lowly server, and think that
            they are being generous throwing $40 on the table. The server
            ends up with a 4% tip that is probably getting split with
            kitchen and bussing staff.

       I don't mind the "extra plate" charge when it is 1/4 or less than
       the price of the lowest cost menu item and allows two diners to
       dine on one meal. Often restaurants offer generous portions because
       many people demand them (feel cheated with less food and would not
       go to the restaurant if the portions were smaller), but when 2
       customers who are happy with smaller meals and eating the same
       thing as each other are served, it is reasonable to expect more
       income for the restaurant than if only one customer were served. It
       still means a much cheaper meal for the customers than ordering 2
       meals, and does not create the waste (or waist) issues.

            Often when restaurants split a meal back in the kitchen, they
            garnish both plates and serve more than half of the
            one-meal-sized side dish (veggie or slaw or fries, etc.). I
            think the fee makes sense in that case.

            The first time I encountered an extra plate charge was several
            years ago. This place served enormous salads...HUGE....so a
            friend and I went there and ordered one but asked for an extra
            plate. They said it would be added charge of 1/2 price. We
            only got one....and each had our own fork and ate out of the
            same plate.....never returned......never will. This encourages
            gluttony and the biggest glutton is the restaurant.

                 You are taking up two seats for the price of one.
                 Restaurants don't make much money and have the highest
                 turnover rate of any business. Stop thinking of yourself
                 and look for perspective.

                      So by your logic, a single diner should pay more
                      than a couple, because restaurants don't have tables
                      for one and a single diner is seated at a table for
                      two?

                      So if 3 people eat at a restaurant that only has
                      tables for 4 should they be charged an extra fee,
                      too? Heaven help people eating alone! The seat thing
                      is a ridiculous argument.

                      BALONEY! The restaurant makes no more money on a
                      single person sitting at a table with one meal as it
                      makes on two people sitting at the same table with
                      the same one meal! It is NOT the number of occupied
                      CHAIRS that matters, it is the number of available
                      TABLES! DUH! As long as you are not occupying more
                      than one table, it costs the restaurant absolutely
                      NOTHING more to allow two people to share one meal!
                      This is nothing more than pure GREED!

                      Saying a restaurant is greedy is like saying any
                      business is greedy. They just want paying customers,
                      and yes the ideal situation would be no empty seats.
                      The only other way to combat people ordering like
                      this is to decrease portion sizes. Then you complain
                      about that. So just don't be so cheap, buy a meal
                      for each person. You guys are the same people that
                      take ketchup packets for home use. Who goes by
                      themselves to dinner anyways?

                 Again, I see a difference between having that salad split
                 between two plates in the kitchen (in which case you have
                 ordered two half-orders, and should be charged extra),
                 and the server bringing you an extra plate (which should
                 not incur a charge). I would not have tipped a server who
                 saw me sharing a plate and didn't offer to bring an
                 extra, small plate.

       I rarely eat at buffets, and when I do I take only what I can eat.
       But often you taste something and it's awful, or just not worth
       eating when there are so many good things on offer (or you notice
       only when you've gotten a good look at it that there's an
       ingredient you can't eat). If anyone tried to charge me for the
       small bits of food I'd rejected, I would refuse to pay. You can't
       force someone to eat, and you'd be treading on dangerous ground to
       require that diners clean their plates. I'd love to take a case
       like that to court.
       I will not eat at a restaurant that demands a credit card for a
       reservation, unless it's a "special" dining night, like Valentine's
       Day, etc. And as for increased prices for peak times, I think the
       way to go is reduced prices for off-peak times, no?
       I get angry when the extra charges are hidden. At one
       long-established local restaurant, a server comes to your table
       while you are looking at menus, and offers an assortment of
       munchies in small bowls, presented on a tray. You are told to
       select what you want. Only when you get the bill do you learn that
       you are charged per bowl. Sure, patrons won't get tricked twice,
       but the place gets a lot on one-time tourist traffic.

       The bagel "fee" is a tax leveled on prepared foods in certain

            for my dog and I still pay the same for both. Also - if they
            are selling large drinks for $1 and coffee costs $1,29 at
            breakfast, if I get a value meal and replace the coffee with
            another drink, why do they charge me an additional 35 cents, I
            am downgrading according to your menu.

                 I ordered happy meal for my son and I don't allow him to
                 drink soda. So I asked if I could have a water. They said
                 they cannot give tap water in a happy meal or replace it
                 with bottled. So I reluctantly ordered an orange juice.
                 They said they only had Hi-C available. So I decided, no
                 drink. That's when the most outrageous part came. If you
                 order a happy meal without a soda, they will charge you
                 for your burger, fries, and apple slices a la carte, it
                 will not include a toy and it will be more expensive than
                 if you ordered a soda. Shocked, I ordered a sprite and
                 when they gave it to me, I dropped it and left.
                 McDonald's is refusing to not give you a soda when you
                 order food for children, how is that for their

            I'd have to agree. There are certain foods that almost require
            toppings to the customer's preference. It's like ordering a
            steak and having an up charge if you would like it seasoned,
            or ordering fries and an up charge for ketchup. I'd probably
            tell the manager that I'm never coming back and make sure that
            a few other customers hear me. I hate being nickel and dimed

            It's is one of my biggest pet peeves. When my husband stops
            off at Taco Bell he picks me up a 7 layer burrito. I'm all
            excited at the treat till I open the bag and see no sauce. I
            can't complain to him because he just did it to be nice, but
            they never ask if you want sauce packets. He never remembers
            to ask and if they don't remind him, I have to go without. How
            hard is it to say? "sauce packets?" I've worked in fast food,
            it's simple enough. I've called to complain, they've promised
            to train their employees but guess what, last week, no sauce.

                 At the local Taco Bell the sauce packets are self-serve,
                 in bins next to the utensils, napkins etc. If you do
                 drive through you have to remember to ask. I never do

       I usually avoid restaurants that charge most of these extra fees.
       But the one thing that drives me crazy is the automatic gratuity
       for a party of 6 or more. First, it assumes that even if the server
       gives excellent service, that the customer will shortchange the tip
       (or, it assumes that we can't do math on a large check, which is
       also insulting). Second, I have been in restaurants with large
       parties many times, and most of the time, the service actually does
       suck (probably because the server knows they are guaranteed a tip
       no matter what).
       A tip is for good service-not an automatic expectation. That means
       the customer gets to decide what to give, not the restaurant.

            It can be a slap in the face, but large parties typically do
            take up a disproportional amount of time, on the server's
            part, than the same amount of people at multiple tables,
            especially distributing and collecting multiple payments.
            Larger groups also tend to stick around longer consuming only
            free refills and not necessarily spending any more money.
            If the service is bad, you talk to a manager. Don't sweat the
            extra gratuity because if you really had unpleasant service, a
            manager will typically more than make up for it with a
            discount or gift card.

                 If the service is bad, just go to that line on the check
                 where it says "tip," write in a negative number, and
                 subtract the undeserved portion of the tip right off of
                 the bill. If the waiter or manager wants to discuss it,
                 they'll have to account for the poor service. Your bank
                 will pay the amount you wrote in as the total.

                 Six couples at six tables = six checks. Six couples at
                 three tables shoved together = 6 checks. Also, filling
                 water glasses and such for one large group instead of six
                 smaller ones takes less trips. I do not see your point.
                 I go out in large groups frequently. We often have groups
                 of 12 to 20. We order a lot of food, and we tip well.
                 Some establishments are very welcoming. Others act like
                 we are a huge inconvenience. They lose our future
                 business.
                 We're usually out after early or mid-week sports, later
                 in the evening, well past the dinner rush. You'd think a
                 3/4 empty place would be glad to get an extra $1000 to
                 $2000 in walk-in business, but some places / servers act
                 like a big group and separate checks is just too much
                 bother. Guess what, server? It might be a chore to ring
                 up 10 checks near closing time, but those empty tables
                 weren't going to tip you $200-$400.

            The only reason places do that is because of the amount of
            people who stiff servers. Having tables with large parties
            requires more time and work than smaller parties. From
            personal experience, and from friend's experiences, it is
            ridiculous to have a party of 10, work your butt off and then
            be lucky to receive a 10% gratuity. People think the servers
            are receiving a wage, so why do they need to tip? They don't
            realize most servers do not even make minimum wage. I made $4
            an hour when I was a server. Servers live off of tips!
            I'm not a huge fan of automatically adding 20% gratuity, but
            it makes sense for larger parties, and I don't see a problem
            with it as long as the customers are informed of the policy
            before hand.

                 But those people probably stiff the servers regardless,
                 right? I get what you're saying, but 10% of a bill for a
                 large party is still more than the 10% the same person
                 would tip if it was just 2 people. A person who tips 20%
                 normally isn't suddenly going to be cheap just because
                 the party is large.
                 I don't know, it just feels wrong.

                      the tip is better. Parties arent concerned with the
                      server....just that their large party is taken care
                      of implicitly with no concern of the amount of time
                      they are consuming. Communal groups who insist on
                      having dinner in a restaurant together......with
                      split checks and no gratuity added, should have to
                      wait on their own group. Again....i challenge you to
                      work in the industry and think otherwise.

                      every server is assigned a section and let say your

                      comes in and takes all three tables. The whole 2-3
                      hours you wait on that big party is the only tip you
                      will make on those hours so i feel sometimes 20%
                      service charge isn't even enough. Larger party also
                      have slower turn around time verses group of 2 or 3

            I understand where you are coming from. As a waiter I have
            witnessed and even split large parties with other
            waiters/waitresses who have given poor service simply because
            they know that the check will have an auto gratuity. Having
            said that I have waited tirelessly on large and small parties
            only to find a tip 10% or below, or no tip at all. Servers
            make $2.13 an hour, and rather than risk spending an hour or
            two waiting on a large group of people only to make $6 or $7,
            I choose to be sure that I am at least going to be payed what
            I deserve for my work. Perhaps if there were a universal
            etiquette on how to tip and treat your waiter, we wouldn't
            need to add on any gratuities.

                 There is now federal minimum wage laws. If you are
                 getting 2.13 per hour, your employer MUST ensure you are
                 taking home $7.25. Not great, but I am sick of servers
                 throwing that $2.13 out there. It is only in some states
                 that allow $2.13 and as I say, federal law mandates you
                 take home at least $7.25.

                      Not true for tipped employees. The minimum wage is
                      only 2.13 for certain employees who primarily earn
                      their money from tips.
                      I never mind the mandatory tip for large parties.
                      I'm always going to drop ~20% on the tip anyway, and
                      I recognize that a single large party (especially
                      during the lunch shift) seriously impairs the
                      server's ability to deal with other tables. In
                      addition, large parties tend to stay at the meal
                      longer than a group of 2-4, meaning that in the time
                      it takes to serve a single group of 8, the server
                      could have served 3 or 4 groups of 4.
                      It's reasonable to guarantee a certain minimum tip
                      in this case, so that the server is guaranteed to
                      make money off the deal. (Otherwise no servers would
                      be motivated to work large parties.)
                      Just make sure it's noted as such on the bill and I
                      don't have a problem.

            The "to insure proper/prompt service" thing is something made
            up by cheapskates. Tips is not an acronym. The historically
            accurate "tip" was the tip of the spear that would be shoved
            through your a** at the village meadhall if you didn't pay the
            barmaids. It evolved a little afterwards in that you'd pay
            more up front for your drinks to the server bringing your ales
            so they'd pay you more attention instead of the peasants at
            the next table. The practice today is why good tipping
            regulars get the attention and a fresh refill while you stare
            blankly at the wall in front of an emtpy glass wondering
            what's going on.

            What you fail to take in to consideration is that servers in
            many parts of this country work on tips alone. When server's
            wages are under $3/hr, we sometimes end up OWING money on
            payday to cover the taxes on our presumed tips (based on the
            servers' sales). So while you may feel gratuity should be
            optional, when someone stiffs a server, that server may
            actually end up not only waiting on that table for free, but
            because they are taxed on a percentage of their sales, they
            actually end up paying to serve that table.
            That being said; if there is a large party or banquet assigned
            to a particular server, that means that they will be taking
            substantially fewer or no other tables for that evening. So
            that ONE party determines a large percent or ALL of their
            earnings for the evening. You seem offended at not being
            trusted to tip appropriately but the unfortunate fact of the
            matter is that there are a lot of people out there who just
            don't. I've had people compliment me up and down for a
            fantastic evening and fantastic service and even ask to speak
            with the manager to let him know how wonderful I was and then
            leave me a 5% tip. If I get stiffed on a small table it's
            unfortunate but I can try to make it up on the next one. But
            if I spend ALL or MOST of my night on one large party and it
            just so happens that they are cheap-skates or ill-informed on
            tipping protocol, that could end up being several hundred
            dollars out of my pocket and that's not a risk I should have
            to take.
            When I know there is an auto-grat attached to a party, I go
            above and beyond to ensure that they are getting a level of
            service that will be deserving of that. And if you go
            somewhere with a large party where the service is truly
            deplorable than by all means say something. But otherwise try
            to understand that the gratuity is not simply an extra little
            bonus for your server...it is their livelihood. And while you
            may feel you always tip appropriately, rest assured there are
            people out there who don't.

            Never been to a restaurant that put a mandatory tip on a table
            of 6, table of 8 or more yes, but not on 6. But if you object,
            you could go in as 2 groups of 3 and get two tables and avoid
            the automatic tip. You could also probably get the meals to go
            and sit where ever in your own home.

       The one I see doing this the most is McDonald's. I wanted mayo
       instead of ketchup on my sandwich and they charged me $.30 (this is
       in the Indianapolis market). It's not a big deal.....but kind of
       flabbergasted me since they give away PACKAGES of mayo for free.
       So, lesson learned: don't have McDonald's put the mayo on your
       sandwich in Indianapolis. Ask for the free packet and do it
       yourself :-).

            McD's is so automated that a special order like that means
            someone has to supervise the assembly of your burger. The
            charge actually makes sense.

                 You must be delusional if you think the making of

                 a standard list of condiments on them, but each sandwich
                 is made by a human, not a machine.

       rhobere is correct that European restaurants usually charge for
       water - but they don't gouge for bottled water like in the US. It's
       also the case that in many Euro countries they charge for bread, so
       you have be careful to decline it if you don't want it. So extras
       happen there as well as in the US - you just have to know about
       them.

            In some European countries, like Italy for example, it doesn't
            matter if you turn down the bread, because you will still be
            charged the "coperto" or cover charge. This is essentially the
            "tax" or tip to even dine out. And if you do tip, they'll look
            at you like you have 7 heads, because it was already included
            in the bill. :)

            In some European countries, the waiter will immediately bring
            a basket of rolls. They are NOT free, you are billed for the
            number you take. This is not a scam, as the customers already
            know this is the normal way of doing business. The rolls you
            don't take are simply offered to the next table. Americans
            might consider this unsanitary, but it's no different than
            being handed a roll by your wife, nobody gets sick from it.

            Maybe because there are some things that cost a heck of a lot
            more to make at home than eating out. Lasagna for instance,
            which costs me upwards of $50 to make a pan, silly for a

            place (not a franchise place) with garlic bread and salad for
            $10, eat a third, take 2/3 home for an additional 2 meals, so
            that $10 meal (plus tip) ends up costing me $4 each for three
            meals.

       You can't tell us you don't agree with charging for butter and
       sauce, then say it's perfectly reasonable to charge $3 for bread
       and $2 for the butter that goes with it. I suppose it's reasonable
       if you make it clear beforehand that there's a fee to charge for
       bread, but a separate fee for the butter? Why?
       I don't mind an automatic gratuity (of 15-18%, not 20) for large
       groups, as long as it's clear they will be charging it before the
       meal, and it's clearly stated on the receipt. But that's all they
       get when they charge it. I won't tip extra. And I don't like being
       deceived. If they try to charge me and don't tell me, I will have a
       problem, and then they will have a problem.
       I'm also not going to pay for prime time or atmosphere. It's
       pretentious and unnecessary, and I'm rather tired of being nickled
       and dimed absolutely everywhere for everything.

                 Understandable. But the author can't have it both ways.
                 Either he's for charging for every little condiment, or
                 against it.
                 Really, if you're going to charge for the bread, why not
                 just roll in the price for butter or oil so that your
                 customer won't feel cheated?

            The condiment conflict is kind of amusing.
            I've always been pretty forgiving of the automatic gratuity.
            Then again I guess I'm pretty forgiving regardless, I can only
            think of a couple times in my life where I deliberately left a
            poor tip. I usually tip 20% as my minimum and frequently hit
            around 30% especially at lunch because I always tip at least
            $3.
            I don't know that I would pay for eating at prime times or at
            specific tables, but I wouldn't rule it out. To me it's about
            getting what you want, if you are willing to pay a little
            extra for it then so be it. If a restaurant is always packed
            with a 45 minute wait during specific times of the day then
            charging a little more during those times makes good business
            sense for everyone involved. If done right the business still
            serves as many customers as they can over a given time while
            making a little more profit, and if it results in less of a
            wait time then the customer also benefits by being served more
            promptly.

       Very well written article. I have been a chef, with an involvement

       most of what you say. The hidden costings in setting up and running
       a catering business/ restaurant, not to mention the rise in the
       cost of ingredients and transportation have forced the industry to
       squeeze pennies out of every place possible - sad truth. However, I
       am souly referring to the characteristics of a small/ private
       business within this economical climate. The slightly more
       corporate side of this argument is an absolute joke, for example
       McDonalds charging extra for ketchup - do they really not make
       enough money already? Â£6-Â£7 for a large burger, chips and a drink
       that would cost no more that 80p for a corporation of that size to
       put together. It's a real shocker that they can even get away with
       it - what's to come in the future? A breathing fee?

       When pouring a drink 'neat' or even a martini 'straight up' more
       alcohol IS used (1 1/2 oz vs 1 1/4 oz), therefore you SHOULD charge

                 It isn't a matter of what you want. Bartenders (I have
                 been one) have a certain protocol in making drinks. They
                 won't ask you if you want 1/4 oz more liquor in your
                 drink, it is made a certain way and unless you specify
                 otherwise, that is how it will be poured. I have had a
                 few people get pissed off at me because I filled the
                 glass completely with ice. Sorry, that is protocol in any
                 bar, fill the glass to the top with ice first, then build
                 the drink. If you don't like a lot of ice then you should
                 state that when you place your order. If you think you
                 will end up with more booze then you are stupid, you will
                 end up with more mix instead. So in your case whether you
                 like it or not, or whether you know it or not, you are
                 getting slightly more booze if ordered neat or in the
                 case of a martini, straight up. And you should be getting
                 charged slightly more because of that. If you want a
                 double, that is your prerogative but unless you specify,
                 you have no control over how your drink is poured. And if
                 anyone is still listening: If you ask a bartender to make
                 you a 'good' drink or suggest he/she make it stronger
                 than a standard pour, you should be asked if you want a
                 double. If you say "no, just give me a hefty pour", well,
                 we know someone looking to get something for nothing is
                 most likely a poor tipper and you will be getting a
                 standard, or less than standard pour. Fact of life.

            If I orders 3 fingers of scotch - on the rocks or neat - it
            should still be the same. If you can't figure out how much the
            ice displaces the scotch you should pour the scotch then put
            the ice in. There is no reason why the amount of alcohol
            should vary that much between neat/on the rocks that would
            warrant an up-charge.

               o Chris
                 Actually Josh, you pour a significant amount more when a
                 drink is ordered with rocks. The 1 or 2 dollar upcharge
                 is completely reasonable. I frequently get complaints
                 from guests if their cocktail ordered on the rocks does
                 not seem to fill the glass, which will normally
                 necessitate giving them an additional full ounce. And you
                 don't order drinks by the finger and dictate your own
                 price. A house's pour is their pour. If I do a four count
                 on a neat pour and it's a $12 glass of JW black, but I
                 need to do a 6 count to fill a rocks glass, the drink
                 should technically cost $18. You're getting a deal with a
                 $2 upcharge.

            I don't get it. Use a shot glass if you can't pour the same
            amount each time. Either way, it should be 1.5 oz. Yes, it
            will look like less in different glasses with ice or not - but
            it doesn't matter.
            Technically, some states have limitations/regulations on this.
            (Not that you are going to have a perfect pour every time).
            It's too complicated to explain price differences with ice or
            without.

       have you ever tried splitting a check? split a pitcher of beer,
       bottle of wine, app, dessert especially when everyone didn't share
       it? Then you have 8 separate credit cards or cash payments needing
       change? Believe me your other tables do not appreciate waiting for
       your attention while you are spening all of your time with this one
       table.

            If you're a waiter or waitress, ask at the beginning of the
            meal if it's all on one check, then just keep track of who has
            what. You're writing it down anyway. Then there's not a lot of
            extra time.
            I'm sorry that splitting a check takes two extra minutes.
            Still no excuse to charge for it or refuse to do it. Unless
            you've been going incredibly slow all night, most of your
            patrons won't even notice a delay.

                 It has also been my experience (as a former waiter) that
                 you make more money in tips when the check is split
                 anyway. Maybe only a buck or two, but if you aren't
                 capable of handling this process swiftly then you
                 shouldn't be a server....bus tables instead (it's not so

                      I agree Josh, when I used to be a waitress I found
                      the tip was better when the check was split.
                      Primarily because some people prefer to tip high
                      whereas as a group they may have just done a
                      standard percentage. And as wah wah wah said .. if
                      you know ahead of time (the server can just as
                      easily ask if the checks are being split) then you
                      can separate accordingly as you take the orders.

                 Actually you have no idea what you're preaching about. At
                 peak hours, I may have as many as 8 tables ordering up to
                 32 individual drinks, apps, and entrees within a 30
                 minute period as long as the front of house has any
                 experience with pacing how I'm being sat. It's quite
                 possible if not probable that I've thrown away any
                 paperwork with your order on it, and if the restaurant
                 isn't using pivot points which their POS can make easily
                 accessible to the server, we will definitively NOT be
                 spending two minutes of our time splitting your check.
                 It's absolutely lovely when 7 people are splitting 4
                 apps, two women are sharing a salad (one came with her
                 daughter who had one bite, and one came with a man...are
                 they splitting the cost of the salad? Who's bill does it
                 go on? Is the man paying for the lady? Are they on the
                 same tab or are they just friends going dutch? Now, let's
                 stand at your table while we literally have 4 dozen OTHER
                 tasks that need to be accomplished concurrently for other
                 tables and watch you all look at each other and say,
                 "Well, I guess I ate most of the calamari so you can put
                 that on my tab," let's not forget that he changed chairs
                 at one point because the sun was in one of the lady's
                 eyes and she needed some shade, so I have no idea what
                 couple is together with whom now. And the one guy wants
                 to buy the first round everyone had, and asks you to put
                 those cocktails on HIS tab.....but your printout only has
                 a long line of drinks from the entire evening, and now
                 your have to go around person by person and ask what they
                 had for the first round....which takes another 2 minutes
                 for them to remember....all while 7 other tables are
                 looking at you like they want to kill you and the idiot
                 table you have to listen to jumble their words and
                 complain about the upcharge for Grey Goose in their
                 Cosmo, which was listed at $8, but will now be $10
                 because you want top shelf.
                 That, hopefully, made any other servers reading this
                 smile and chuckle, because you have seen this happen,
                 verbatum.
                 Granted, that's a nightmarish version, but when your
                 income is based on keeping all tables pleased, and this
                 "supposedly simple two minute task" takes 10 minutes (not
                 to mention that some restaurants charge the servers for
                 each credit card run...so thanks for handing me 7 cards)
                 you start to get the picture. Just look at the damn bill
                 for a minute, hand me your card, and say $60 on this one,
                 $40 on this one, and the rest on the Visa. Boom. You just

            Splitting a check is not the restaurant doing you a favour,
            it's you doing them a favour by "joining tables" and reducing
            their costs. If they are going to complain about splitting a
            check for a party of three, how about asking for three
            separate tables when you walk in? They will be out two extra
            tables, need extra waiters, will need to serve extra bread
            bowls, pitchers... etc.
            So next time you walk in with a group, ask if there's a charge
            for splitting a check and added on automatic gratuity. If they
            say yes, tell them you are not a party of 8 but 8 separate
            customers that will occupy 8 tables and 8 servers. Watch their
            reaction.

                 Splitting the check can be costly to the business
                 because, take someone like myself who eats out with
                 friends at the local wing joint. You have a table of 10
                 people (no fixed gratuity) splitting a check 8 ways, that
                 can be up to 8 credit card runs. And it takes the server
                 about 10-15 minutes to distribute the checks, collect the
                 checks, run all of the tabs, make change (for the cash
                 people), redistribute the final check, etc. which means
                 she can't serve her other tables. On the up side, people
                 tend to tip better in larger groups with split tabs. If
                 my meal cost me $6, I feel bad about leaving any less
                 than $2 and change, which is a 33% tip. Most people tip
                 high on smaller amounts. On larger amounts, I pretty much
                 stick to the 15% rule, give or take the individual.

                 It's not the "splitting" part that's the problem, it's
                 the credit card charges restaurants have to pay. It costs
                 money every single time a card is run on the machine,
                 depending on the credit card company it could be standard
                 fee + percentage of sale. So, if every one in the party
                 is splitting checks, it does cost the restaurant more to
                 run all those cards.

                      If you had ten tables with one person each, you'd

                      It should make no difference with a party of ten.

                      more than the fee takes away.

            Soft drinks at fast food restaurants are the most marked up
            item in the world, short of printer ink. There is a 6000%
            mark-up on your soft drink. That means if only 1 person bought
            a soft drink, a store could give a free soda to nearly every
            other customer for the rest of the day, and still make a
            profit.

                 Yes, soft drinks (and tea, lemonade, similar) are
                 expensive, but also remember you get unlimited refills at
                 MOST restaurants. Now, I typically opt for water because
                 I know that soda is just empty calories that I don't
                 really crave all that much, but no matter what sits in
                 front of me, I can typically be on my 2nd refill by the
                 time my meal comes. The average cost is about $2.50-$3
                 for a soft drink, and if you only drink one glass, that's
                 about a 5x mark-up to what you would spend on the
                 equivalent volume at your local 7-11's fountain
                 dispenser. But as you drink up, 2-3 glasses later, you're
                 pretty much on par with the cheapest fountain drinks on
                 the market.

       Your article is ridiculous. When people split plates, they
       generally receive bigger portions than the "half" they should
       receive. Guests know they save money, and get more food,
       ultimately. Moreover, the extra 1-2$ for the Rocks pour is due to
       the fact that drinks with mixers, as a standard have 1 1/2 ounce
       pours. Drinks on the "rocks" are a 2 ounce pour. The extra money is
       for the additional 1/2 ounce of booze. I have worked in the
       business for 20 years, and I have NEVER been to a place that
       charges for tap water.

            Did you even read the article? The author acknowledged that if
            the restaurant splits the meal and prepares the two portions,
            a split plate fee is warranted - his gripe was with charging
            simply for an extra plate, with the diners doing the splitting
            themselves. Your argument - that the guests get bigger
            portions - would only apply if the restaurant is doing the
            splitting. Some great restaurants do this, and as part of the
            fee, the diners get extra portions of the side dishes and/or
            salads.

            No, your attitude is ridiculous.
            First off, they explained the pour difference in the article.
            Did you bother to read it? If so, why repeat something they
            said, only make it sound like they never explained it? Makes
            zero sense.
            Secondly, in the case of splitting portions, he talked about
            asking for an extra plate, which does NOT result in more of a
            portion, does it, Einstein?
            So, you have been in the business for 20 years and have never
            seen a place charge for tap water. How many places are there
            in the world, and how many have you been to? Less than 1%, I
            bet. But somehow, your bitch highness is suddenly an expert on
            every last restaurant on the whole freaking planet? Get off
            your high horse bitch.

               o Maggie
                 Jackson, you are a classless ass hat. I'm guessing you
                 have a very, very tiny penis, hence the sever anger
                 issues. Restaurants in the US do not charge for tap
                 water. I wasn't not referring to foreign countries. WTF
                 is wrong with you? Oh, wait. Yes. A tiny penis.

                 On the contrary, YOUR attitude is ridiculous. Maggie is
                 just stating her opinions, and you're the one attacking
                 her and calling her a bitch, which is completely
                 unwarranted. Time for you to get off the internet and end
                 your power trip...

            Go to Europe. Every restaurant charges for tap water. Sonic
            Drive-in? Charges for tap water. There's a few thousand
            examples for you.

                      European tap water has to meet stricter safety
                      regulations than American tap water.

               o James
                 In the EU it is illegal for premises licenced to serve
                 alcohol (i.e. the vast majority of restaurants) to charge
                 for tap water. I've never come across a restaurant that
                 charges for tap water on either side of the Atlantic, or
                 anywhere else in the world for that matter.

                      the few places I've ever been to that charged for
                      tap water was like 5 or 10 cents, not the same $2
                      they charge for a soda. And that was just to offset
                      the cost of the to-go or cleaning the cup more than
                      the water. But yeah, I've almost never been to any
                      place that charges for tap water, either.

            The handful of folks that I know that would "split" their
            plate always did so themselves at the table. They would order
            the one meal, two drinks and then eat off the same plate or
            used one of those bread & butter plates put on the table. With
            this, there was no extra food being served for that "split"
            plate.

            Because they charge you for stuff when you want extra? If a
            restaurant gives extras away like there is no tomorrow it
            doesn't mean they are friendlier, it means their food cost is
            ridiculously cheap and they're making a ton of money off you
            anyway. Chain restaurants have less of a problem with it, but
            locally or individually owned restaurants can live or die by a
            tight budget, especially if they are just starting out.
