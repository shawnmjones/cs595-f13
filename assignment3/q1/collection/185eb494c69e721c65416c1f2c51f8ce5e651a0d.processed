   RICHLAND COUNTY, SC -- Despite a lawsuit challenging the
   constitutionality of Richland County's election law, a public hearing
   today into the causes of the Nov. 6 county election mess will go
   forward.

   "We're definitely still on," county legislative delegation chairman
   Sen. Darrell Jackson, D-Richland said Sunday night.

   "This is a fact-finding hearing, not a hearing to take any action,"
   Jackson said. The hearing begins at 1 p.m. in Room 105 in the Gressette
   Senate Office Building on State House grounds.

   At the hearing, county Elections & Voter Registration director Lillian
   McBride is expected to break a three weeks' silence about numerous
   difficulties voters faced in voting in Richland County Nov. 6
   elections. Many people said they gave up the chance to vote because the
   long lines of up to five hours meant they had to get back to work or
   care for a child instead of waiting.

   The hearing will not only spotlight McBride, who at $86,344 is one of
   the county's top paid public officials, but also showcase the normally
   invisible legislative delegation, made up of the four state senators
   and 11 state representatives from Richland County.

   The lawmakers are expected to grill McBride, whom they installed in
   office in 2011 and whose salary they set, as well as Elections
   Commission chair Liz Crum. Crum's five-member board is also appointed
   by the delegation and oversees McBride's department.

   Jackson said that a lawsuit brought by Columbia resident William
   "Rusty" DePass and the S.C. Public Interest Foundation is not about the
   current election debacle.

   The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the 2011 state law that
   established the Richland County Elections & Voter Registration office
   and does not concern the Nov. 6 election, Jackson said.

   Earlier Sunday, delegation Sen. John Scott, D-Richland, said he was
   considering not attending today's hearing because he, like Jackson and
   Sens. Joel Lourie, D-Richland, and John Courson, R-Richland, is a
   defendant in DePass's lawsuit.

   "We might need to cancel that meeting because of the lawsuit," Scott
   said. "You don't have a hearing if you have a lawsuit. If you get sued
   in the middle of doing something, you can't do anything -- you got to
   wait and get it cleared."

   Despite Scott's concerns, other lawmakers want to go forward.

   Courson, the Senate leader, praised Jackson for insisting on holding
   the meeting.

   "The public needs to know what happened, how it happened, why it
   happened and how we can prevent this from ever happening again,"
   Courson said Sunday. "This is something that needs to be discussed."

   Courson said he especially wants to hear McBride's explanation of why
   there weren't sufficient numbers of machines at the county's 124
   precincts, why enough technicians weren't available to fix broken
   machines promptly, as well as get the answers to numerous other
   questions.

   Although some have urged that the delegation set aside time Monday for
   the public to speak, Jackson said that would result in an overly long
   hearing. Besides, many "horror stories" about five-hour waits in voting
   lines, broken down balloting machines and numerous people giving up
   their right to vote because they couldn't wait for hours to vote have
   already been aired, he said. .

   "The purpose of this meeting is to hear from (county Elections & Voter
   Registration office director) Lillian McBride and Elections Commission
   chair Liz Crum," Jackson said.

   "There is no way we can hear them if we take 100 testimonies from the
   public and hold a 10-hour public hearing. It could take that long
   without even hearing from Ms. McBride and Ms. Crum. The purpose of this
   hearing is to really get down to the bottom of what happened."

   Recently, Jackson said he sent an email to all delegation members,
   letting them know if they wanted to gather more information from
   constituents, they could hold a public hearing in their district.

   Delegation staff would help make a record of comments at those meetings
   and make them part of the public record about what happened, Jackson
   said.

   In a related matter, Scott said he still hasn't heard from Attorney
   General Alan Wilson's office about whether the delegation has the legal
   authority to fire McBride, should it decide it's necessary to remove
   her. Scott said he's been out of town since last week and it's possible
   he has a letter at his office.

   Courson said that at some point, he would like the delegation to
   discuss the possibility of turning the operation of McBride's
   department over to the county. After all, he said, the county provides
   its $1.2 million budget and has sufficient numbers of legal and other
   staff to support it.

   It wasn't just voters who were inconvenienced on Nov. 6 -- many of the
   1,200-odd poll workers were too, Courson said.

   "Some of them were there until the early morning hours," he said.

   Although voters won't get a chance to speak directly at today's
   hearing, their voices are likely to be heard.

   Rep. Mia Butler Garrick sent a recent letter to constituents expressing
   concerns about the meeting being held in the middle of the day when
   most people are at work. She invited voters to email her their election
   day experiences and promised to share those stories during the hearing.

   "I've got the same questions the general public has, honestly," Garrick
   said. "We're all searching for answers."

   Dixie Hicks, a Columbia resident who spent four hours in line at the
   Keenan Precinct at Sanders Middle School, wanted to attend the 1 p.m.
   hearing but said it is unlikely.

   "Can I take my break, run down there, pay to park and stand there for
   10 seconds before I have to turn around and leave to get back to work?"
   she asked.

   But Hicks said she wants answers on why her precinct had so few voting
   machines and one of the few that were at the polling station was
   broken.

   "Why do we have broken machines and where the hell were they?" she
   said.
