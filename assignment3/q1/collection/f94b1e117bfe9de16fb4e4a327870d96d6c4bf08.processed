After 3 bodies found, mayor warns: 'There might be more victims'

   By Emily Smith and Chris Welch, CNN
   updated 8:53 PM EDT, Sun July 21, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: "I always watched him. I never turned my back," says neighbor
       who knows suspect
     * All three victims were found near each other, wrapped in multiple
       layers of plastic bags
     * The suspect "idolized" serial killer Anthony Sowell, according to
       the East Cleveland mayor
     * Police and volunteers continue to search the area Sunday

   (CNN) -- Three bodies have been discovered in East Cleveland, Ohio,
   police say, and a man is in custody in connection with the case.

   "We are dealing with a sick individual, and we have reason to believe
   that there might be more victims," East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton
   told CNN.

   All three victims appear to be young black women, their decomposing
   bodies wrapped in layers of plastic and taped up, according to
   authorities.

   Two bodies were found Saturday, one in the basement of an abandoned
   house, the other in a field nearby. The first victim was found Friday
   in a garage on the same block after police received a call about a foul
   odor.
   East Cleveland mayor stunned by murders
   Women found wrapped in plastic
   3 bodies found wrapped in plastic

   The first victim was found naked with indications of trauma, police
   say. The second victim was found wearing a green hoodie, and the third
   was wearing a leopard print leotard.

   The garage where the first victim was found was leased to Michael
   Madison, according to Detective Sgt. Scott Gardner with the East
   Cleveland police.

   Authorities obtained a search warrant for Madison's apartment and found
   "additional evidence of decomposition" there, he said.

   The 35-year-old suspect was later located and taken into custody
   without incident after a standoff at his mother's house.

   According to police, Madison was convicted of attempted rape in 2001
   and is a registered sex offender.

   CNN could not immediately reach a representative for Madison.

   Norton believes the killings happened over a 10-day period.

   "One of the things that makes us believe it's the same suspect is the
   way that they were all wrapped ... and the same concealment of each of
   the victims," he said.

   According to Norton, Madison "idolized" and was "influenced" by
   convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell.

   Sowell was [41]sentenced to death in 2011 for killing 11 women in
   Cuyahoga County, Ohio.

   "Unfortunately, this is a sick individual who appears to have been
   influenced by another sick individual," Norton told CNN. "If he had
   been out for one more hour, there's no telling what would have
   happened."

   One hundred volunteers were going house to house Sunday "to see if
   there's anything else out there that police need to know about," he
   added. Cadaver dogs were assisting in the search.

   East Cleveland Police Chief Ralph Spotts told [42]CNN affiliate WEWS
   that authorities have received tips from the public and hope to get
   more.

   "A lot of people knew him and saw that he was a troubled individual and
   now, you know, we're getting tips from even females saying that they
   were in his house and they got away, but never said anything," he said.

   Shaeaun Child, a neighbor who tipped police off about the foul smell in
   the garage, told CNN he knows Madison. The two argued once over the
   blocking of a driveway.

   "From what I know, he was an OK person when I first met him. And then
   from there, he actually, he had a lot of conflicts with different girls
   that he knew," Child said. "When he real upset with someone, he get
   real loud. You could hear him like two blocks away."

   He continued: "After my conflict with him, I always watched him. I
   never turned my back because you never know."

   So far, police have been unable to identify any of the victims. The
   Cuyahoga County medical examiner said in a Sunday statement that
   "identification and final cause of death may take several days" given
   the advanced state of decomposition. Currently the medical examiner's
   office is not asking people with missing relatives to provide DNA
   samples.

   "We hope and pray that there are no more (bodies)," the mayor said.

   No charges have yet been filed.

   East Cleveland is seven miles northeast of Cleveland, Ohio. The city,
   incorporated in 1911, occupies three square miles.

   According to 2010 census data, the city of almost 18,000 is
   predominately African-American and has the highest poverty rate in
   Cuyahoga County.
