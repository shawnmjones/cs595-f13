Core Values
Why Apple should Think Different about how its workers in Asia are mistreated

   [12]Image of Core Values
   February 1, 2012 [13]George Takei [14]Allegiance World Premiere at the
   Old Globe [15]Exclusive Pre-sale by George Takei

   We live in a world where we rarely stop to think about where the food
   we eat, the oil we burn and the products we use come from.
   Recently, the radio program "This American Life" exposed the horrific
   working conditions in Apple's Chinese factories that manufacture the
   iPhone.  Finding it cheaper to use human labor than to automate, the
   factory assigns workers to shifts that has them performing the same
   repetitive tasks, sometimes for up to 35 hours straight, often
   resulting in debilitating and irreversible carpal tunnel syndrome.
   This was on top of New York Times reporting in 2011 that documented
   high rates of worker suicide at Apple's Foxconn component plant in
   China.

   Apple can do better, and it should.  Even if it means we all pay a bit
   more for our iPhones and iPads.  To its credit, Apple has taken some
   steps already to improve conditions, including allowing the Fair Labor
   Association to audit its now publicly released list of suppliers.  That
   resulted in the discovery of six instances of child labor violations.
   What Apple should do next is make public a comprehensive worker
   protection strategy, and release the results of all of its audits
   for complete transparency.  An online petition, begun by my good friend
   and iDevice user Mark Shields, asks just that.

   Take a moment and read and sign the petition, not only to send a
   message to Apple, but to make a statement that you care about your
   fellow humans on this planet, and that better and cheaper gadgets
   should not come at the cost of misery for over a million people.

as Sam Kimura

   February 18, 2011 [69]That blog is so Takei!

   SAM KIMURA is an elderly veteran and war hero from World War II, living
   alone and hardened against the world.  He has not spoken to his family
   for over fifty years, but remains haunted by a longing for things lost
   decades ago.  Sam stands with the "old guard" of the Japanese American
   Citizens League, who condemned those who resisted the draft during
   World War II or showed any other sign of disloyalty to the United
   States.  But a surprise visit from a stranger, just after the events of
   9/11, rekindles memories, and Sam rediscovers things he once knew, and
   learns new inf
