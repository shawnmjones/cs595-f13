[22]Two final gun amendments fail. Reid orders bill carried over until
Thursday

   Twenty-seven wooden angel figures are seen placed in a wooded area
   beside a road near the Sandy Hook Elementary School for the victims of
   a school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut December 16, 2012. Twelve
   girls, eight boys and six adult women were killed
   Two of the final four amendments to the gun bill the Senate considered
   Wednesday followed the path of the first five into defeat. All
   amendments needed 60 votes to pass because: friggin' filibuster rules.

   The [29]Burr amendment would have mandated that people can only be
   barred from buying firearms for mental health reasons when a judicial
   authority has made that determination. Defeated 56-44.

   The [30]Lautenberg-Blumenthal amendment would have imposed a limit of
   10 rounds in ammunition magazines. Defeated 46-54.

   Two more proposals--the [31]Barrasso amendment and the
   [32]Harkin-Alexander amendment--will be considered Thursday along with
   whatever Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid chooses to do regarding the
   main bill.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [46]Tagging tips - [47]Search For Tags - [48]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       filibuster reform courtesy of Dems?
       I'm sure the calculus includes the fact that the chances the GOP
       loses the house are slim.
       We've seen the damage the GOP can do with the House alone ... if
       they had the Senate?
       Sure if the Dems reform the filibuster, then it's an all out sprint
       passing their programs from now to 2014, but you'd better be sure
       you can hang on to the Senate - and there are 7 Dems up for
       re-elect in 2014.
       That seems to be the equation.

       In fact they wouldn't even wait until they had to go nuclear. They
       would do what Reid and the Dems should have done - made the change
       at the beginning of the session.
       That's why it was spineless AND stupid for Reid and the old guard
       Democrats to block any meaningful filibuster reform.

       Because of Harry Reid, Carl Levin, Diane Feinstein and a few other
       Democrats meaningful legislation can't get through the Senate - the
       Democratically controlled Senate.
       Their hands are bloody.
       I'm particularly repulsed by the cynical nature of Harry coming out
       today in favor of Feinstein's assault rifle ban - when he knew for
       sure it wouldn't pass.

   assault weapons yet opposed filibuster reform before she floated the
   ban. They know they can keep their elite jobs as long as they look as

   I used to be 100% right-wing on guns.  Then I had a nervous breakdown
   and decided to try to kill myself.  (I was 21 at the time.)  I was
   saved by a friend on instant messenger who, in an act of desperation,
   sent me a link on youtube to the unedited news conference where Bud
   Dwyer killed himself.   After viewing that, I never thought of it
   again, and I became anti-gun, realizing the risk to those who are
   suicidal.  In fact, I was listening to the Diane Rehm show the other
   week, and one of her guests mentioned that people choose to commit
   suicide with guns if they're serious about it, because it usually
   results in death, whereas wrist cutting and pills don't and are usually
   just a cry for help.

   Just thought I'd share my little testimonial.  Perhaps if some of these
   senators were shown videos of people getting mowed down, they'd have
   voted for the bill.  (Or not, as they don't have souls.)

   rests squarely on the shoulders of Harry Reid and the old guard
   Democrats who refused to enact filibuster reform. And just to be clear,
   if the justification for refusing to reform the filibuster is that
   someday the Dems will lose the Senate and will need to have it, then
   all I can say is get real. The last time the GOP contolled the senate
   they threatened to do away with the filibuster everytime the Dems even
   hinted at invoking it. When the Republicans come into power again, and
   God help us, they probably will, they will not hesitate to get rid of
   the filibuster all together if it helps them forward their agenda. No
   wonder Howard Dean is threatening to leave the party.

       The votes on these amendments took place under the special rule for

   Recommended by:

   If it weren't for the filibuster we would now have:

   * Federally mandated reciprocity of Concealed Carry.
   * Pistol purchases across state lines
   * A ban on firearm registries
   * Peaceful Traveler laws that permit stopping in state.

   Also increased funding for school security.

   And all we had to give up was:

   * Advertised, online and gun show purchases require background checks.
   Private, non-advertised sales excluded.
   * Purchasing with intent to sell to a known felon becomes a federal
   felony.

   No AWB, No mag ban. Those both failed on the merits, sans filibuster.

   Gun rights activists are the ones that have cause to be upset today. I
   really don't think the rest of you know the first damned thing that
   you're bitching about.

 For those who say Reid shouldn't have changed ([635]0+ / 0-)

   the filibuster rule, because republicans could win the majority in the
   senate. I say Reid could have change the filibuster rule to make it
   harder for republicans even if they won a majority, by decreasing the
   filibuster from 60 to around 53 or 54 votes. Republicans would have to
   knock out 7 or 8 senate Dems to gain a majority in the senate. He did
   have that option.
