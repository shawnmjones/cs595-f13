   [30]Ross Douthat is one of many pundits providing Monday morning
   quarterbacking on the Washington Post.

     As disruptive as the Internet has been for journalism, The Post was
     uniquely positioned to succeed amid the chaos. And it has struggled,
     in part, because the paper's leaders failed to step into an
     online-era role that should have been theirs for the taking. ...

   Douthat's argument is that, with the wide use of the Internet, news had
   become more topic oriented than place oriented, with news sites
   becoming more generalized.

     In this landscape, The Wall Street Journal has a clear role as the
     paper of the American business class, with The Economist, The
     Financial Times and the Bloomberg empire as its supplements and
     competitors. The New York Times fills a similar role for the
     intelligentsia and the liberal professional classes. The Huffington
     Post is basically the nation's left-wing tabloid, and it has several
     right-wing rivals and imitators. ESPN.com serves as the nation's
     sports page. And then various outlets, from BuzzFeed to The
     Atlantic, are competing to find or build a general-interest niche.

     Since there aren't that many major niches, most existing newspapers
     were always going to be losers from this shift.

     But The Washington Post was different, because even though the
     Grahams placed a fierce emphasis on being a local paper, the
     locality The Post covers is inherently national. And given that
     D.C.'s influence has only increased in the last 20 years, and the
     public's interest in national politics has surged, it would have
     been entirely natural for The Post to become, in the new-media
     dispensation, the paper of record for political coverage -- the only
     must-read for people who run the country, who want to run it, who
     think they run it, etc.

     Instead, it's possible to date the moment when that opportunity
     slipped away: it happened in 2006, when John Harris and Jim VandeHei
     left The Post to found Politico.

   Speaking of notable dates, write this one down, because today I think
   Douthat is mostly right about the Post's missed opportunity. He's not
   right about much else, but I'll buy this theory. Mostly.

   Now, come on inside and let's see what other shocking ideas are being
   punted about.

   [31]Leonard Pitts opines on the other big topic for pundits this
   morning: just what will Amazon's Jeff Bezos do with his latest toy?

     Newspapers have become the bullied school kid of American
     journalism.

     Meaning that, as a small child will surrender his lunch money to
     bigger kids and spend the noon hour watching other people eat, so
     have newspapers wound up in the ignominious position of surrendering
     our product -- information -- to Internet and cable outlets and
     watching them reap handsome profits from aggregating and
     re-reporting it while we furlough employees and cut back home
     delivery. They take our product and kick our butts with it

     So it was with no small interest that I received last week's news of
     the sale of the Washington Post. After 80 years of stewardship by
     the storied Graham family, the Post will become the property of Jeff
     Bezos, the man who founded Amazon.com. Sale price: $250 million. ...

     Think about it: How often do you see a cable news station, local TV
     news outlet or blog originate -- not aggregate or opine upon, but
     originate -- some story of major local significance not involving
     violent crime? As a rule -- yes, there are exceptions -- they don't
     do that. They are not designed to.

   I do not think those exceptions are as rare as Mr. Pitts thinks they
   are, but hey, I'm in the middle of writing a column entirely lifted
   from the editorial pages of dead-tree print journals, so what do I
   know?

   [32]Maureen Dowd has been absent from APR for several weeks, since
   she's been on one of her "how can I take Washington politics and make
   it seem even more childish and pointless than it already is" stints.
   This week she's marginally better as she looks to 2016.

     From the sidelines, [Hillary] is soaking up a disproportionate
     amount of attention and energy, as though she were already Madam
     President.

     She is supposed to be resting and off making $200,000 speeches, but
     instead she's around every political corner.

     The cicadas never showed up. But we can't hear ourselves think here
     this summer over the roar of the Clinton machine -- and the buzzing
     back to life of old Clinton enemies. Meanwhile, Obama's vaunted
     campaign machine, which has morphed into a political group called
     Organizing for Action, has sputtered in its attempt to tear down
     Republican obstacles and push through his agenda.

     While President Obama seems drained and disgusted at the idea of
     punching through the Republican blockade that awaits him on his
     return from Martha's Vineyard, he told Jay Leno that Hillary "had
     that post-administration glow" when they met for lunch recently.

     As the president was getting ready for his news conference, his
     former secretary of state was dominating the news with an event she
     didn't even attend. Emily's List held what was, in essence,
     Hillary's first Iowa campaign event, titled "Madam President" and
     featuring Claire McCaskill, the Missouri senator who famously broke
     away from Clinton Inc. to join the Obama revolution in 2008. Now
     McCaskill, who once said she wouldn't trust Bill Clinton near her
     daughter, is presciently back in the fold, on board with Ready for
     Hillary, the super PAC supporting Clinton for 2016.  ...

     As ABC News's Michael Falcone reported from Iowa, the state that
     allowed Obama to vault over Hillary, McCaskill said she's dreaming
     of "that moment in 2017 when we can say `Madam President' to Hillary
     Rodham Clinton.' "

   No one is much better at reading the tea leaves than Claire. Let's just
   hope that Hillary's plan for dealing with the right doesn't involve
   dusting off "triangulation."

   [33]Chris Cillizza awards Mitch McConnell a much-deserved "worst week."

     Marriages of convenience rarely work out.

     So when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) picked Jesse
     Benton, political consigliere to the Paul family -- Rand and Ron --
     to manage his 2014 reelection race, campaign sharps began placing
     bets on how long it would last.

     The union hit a rough patch this past week when it was revealed that
     Benton told a former Ron Paul aide that he was "holding my nose for
     two years" because of the benefits his current position would
     probably have for Rand Paul's future (presidential) prospects.

   Only two years? I've been holding my nose, waiting for McConnell's
   stink to blow out of the Senate since 1985.

   [34]Andrew Liepman falls on the "no hero" side of the Snowden argument.

     Edward Snowden is now out of his limbo at Moscow's airport,
     presumably ensconced in some Russian dacha, wondering what the next
     phase of his young life will bring. Having spent 30 years in the
     intelligence business, I fervently hope the food is lousy, the
     winter is cold, and the Internet access is awful. But I worry less
     about what happens to this one man and more about the damage Snowden
     has done -- and could still do -- to America's long-term ability to
     strike the right balance between privacy and security.

     ...

     Incidents like the Snowden affair put my former colleagues in the
     intelligence community in an impossible position. Yes, the official
     explanations about the virtues of data-collection efforts can sound
     self-justifying and vague. But they're still right. I know firsthand
     that Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA director, is telling the truth
     when he talks about plots that have been preempted and attacks that
     have been foiled because of intelligence his agency collected. I
     know because I was on the inside, I have long held security
     clearances, and I participated in many of the activities he
     describes.

     ...the intelligence community -- always a less sympathetic
     protagonist than a self-styled whistle-blower -- actually has a good
     story to tell about how seriously the government takes privacy
     issues. We should tell it.

   So tell it, and let the rest of us decide if it's "good."

   [35]The New York Times looks at a new twist in what was already one of
   the twistiest (and strangest) stories in science.

     When Henrietta Lacks was stricken with an aggressive cancer more
     than 60 years ago, doctors who treated her at Johns Hopkins Hospital
     in Baltimore took cells from her tumor without her permission or
     knowledge, as was common practice at the time. ...

     The cells, called HeLa cells, are ubiquitous in labs around the
     world and have been used in more than 74,000 research studies on
     almost every disease. The cells have helped researchers develop a
     polio vaccine and gain insights into cell biology, in vitro
     fertilization, and cancer, among other advances.

     ... last week when the National Institutes of Health announced an
     agreement with the Lacks family that will restrict N.I.H.-financed
     research on the genome of HeLa cells (not the use of HeLa cells in
     experiments) and place two family members on a committee to approve
     such research. The family was especially concerned that publishing
     the full genomic sequence of HeLa cells would violate its privacy by
     revealing abnormalities in genes that could be transmitted to later
     generations.

   Members of the Lacks family have long expressed concerns about use of
   Henrietta's cells, including fears that use of the HeLa cells in
   experiments was somehow causing Henrietta pain, or that the cloned
   cells were a step toward cloning more copies of their lost relative.
   How genetic material gets handled continues to get more complicated.

   [36]Peggy Schultz on student loans... and Marie Antoinette.

     While some historians suggest it actually was Marie-Therese, wife of
     Louis XIV, who said the now-infamous words, and that "cake" should
     instead be "brioche," the basic idea is the same: Those in control,
     the "haves," can be impervious to the daily struggles of the
     "have-nots."

     I was reminded of that uncaring comment when I read Sen. Ron
     Johnson's response to proposed legislation on student loan interest
     rates. Johnson said: "When we make loans far more accessible, when
     we subsidize the (interest) rates, who pays for that? The taxpayers
     -- a lot of working people who aren't sending their kids to
     college."

     ... by telling high school graduates they might need to settle for
     lower-wage, service industry jobs because their families can't
     afford to pay for a four-year college education, Johnson is imposing
     an unrealistic and unfair limitation on thousands of students.

   [37]William Feeney has a study tailor made for everyone tired of human
   politics, or those who think all politics are for the birds.

     In a paper published in PNAS, [zoologist Máté Nagy] and his
     colleagues studied the behavior of domestic pigeons (Columba livia).
     Their aim was to study social dominance in one task and use the
     results to analyze the behavior of leaders (if there were any) in a
     new task.

     ...Nagy found that the leaders in flock-flying were different from
     those that were socially dominant during the feeding exercise. These
     results are unlike what you would see with gray wolves or chacma
     baboons, where the socially dominant individual may also lead the
     group. The leaders did have some common features, though. The
     socially dominant individuals were more aggressive than average
     flock members and had a comparatively larger body.

     Because of the complications involved in flock-flying, it's possible
     that a somewhat less aggressive and possibly better informed
     individual takes the leading position. However, there was no
     relation between leadership and age, so it wasn't that the more
     experienced flyers lead the flock.

   Flock-flying. Running a democracy. Maybe both of these  activities that
   involve steering big groups call for leaders who aren't the more
   socially aggressive types who excel elsewhere. Are these pigeons onto
   something?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       for about 15+ years, years ago it was my local paper. I went to
       work each day and had the Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall
       Street Journal on my desk each day. I was supposed to read each of
       them.
       Outside of Ezra Klein I don't recall the last time I read the
       Washington Post. I don't even have a bookmark for the site. They
       lost me and that is their fault.
       I mean the Washington Post was my daily newspaper for almost two
       decades. Now I find myself here or Talking Points Memo before the
       Post.

 I used to DELIVER the Washington Post. ([180]5+ / 0-)

       Long, long ago, in another world, I lived in the DC suburbs and
       grew up reading the Post every day, as well as the Evening Star,
       and the News (a tabloid whose prefix I'm forgetting after 40-odd
       years). I majored in journalism in college and worked in it for
       several years until the world changed. I loved newspapers.
       Obviously, I stopped reading those other papers when I left the
       area, and now they probably don't exist at all. But I used to read
       the Post on Sundays -- purchased with the New York Times at local
       newsstands -- for years.
       They both lost me somewhere during the Bush years. I couldn't take
       the lying and bs everyone was spewing. Journalism got sick during
       the Reagan years and nearly died under the Bush regime. It's on
       life support now.
       I'd like to see Jeff Bezos bring back a real newspaper culture to
       his vanity purchase. Make the NY Times and the rest of the
       journalism world sit up and take notice.
       Sadly, from what I've read about him, I don't think that's going to
       happen. Surprise me, Mr. Bezos. Everything old seems to be new
       again -- do it with the Washington Post and you might find yourself
       with a big hit on your hands.

 McConnell Primary>National Disaster: Solution? ([189]0+ / 0-)

   Problem is summarized [190]by Josh Marshall as follows:

     Whether or not McConnell finally wins or loses is basically a
     secondary point. It's what he'll do trying to win from now until
     election day 2014. ... McConnell now has to outcrazy the crazies on
     Capitol Hill to stay alive politically.

   The risk of this craziness harming the national interest is discussed
   in more detail [191]by TMP's Sahil Kapur.

   A potential solution?

   Nominate McConnell as ambassador to China (and perhaps his Taiwan-born
   wife Elaine Chao, who was in GW Bush's cabinet, as US representative to
   Taiwan). If a deal cannot be worked out on Kentucky Demoratic Governor
   Beshear's appointment of an interim replacement as US Senator from
   Kentucky, then perhaps it would be possible for McConnell's appointment
   to take effect after or near the end of the current Senate term.

   An important downside of this approach would be that it would enable
   McConnell's Tea Party challenger Bevin to use all of his own and
   McConnell's campaign funding to attack Grimes.  But perhaps this damage
   to Grimes is unavoidable in order to protect the national interest.

   Of course no Democrats would like to see Bevin in the Senate, but what
   are the consequences for the 2014 elections, and for the national
   interest before and after them, if McConnell goes full Tea Party
   throughout the next year?  A hint of these consequences is provided in
   the Kapur article linked above.

       On so many levels, its borderline insane.
       First, why would Mitch give up the opportunity to be Majority
       Leader for a powerless ambassadorship? Makes no sense.
       Second, no Republicans would ever go along with with it because a
       Democrat would appoint McConnell's replacement. Losing a seat in
       return for what? Some bullshit crap about the national interest?
       When has the GOP ever cared about that?
       Finally, Kapur is just dead wrong. A government shutdown would
       DESTROY McConnell. He'd lose by 10 points and he knows it. Which is
       why he will make a lot of noise to the tea party, but then step
       aside and let McCain or somebody else avoid the shutdown. Shutting
       down the government would ruin him and he's not a stupid man.

       1. I want to see him vs. Bevin in the head to heads.
       2. I want to gauge support for shutting down the govt.
       Now if McConnell is down 5 points in the primary, or even tied,
       coupled with 50+ support for a shutdown, then I'd say he's
       cornered.
       But if he is seeing internal polling telling him that he can both
       beat Bevin and avoid shutting down the government, then he's not
       cornered at all is he?
       So I would want to see some polling before I say anything

 Desperate times Desperate Measures? Q&A ([226]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [227]Josiah Bartlett, [228]Amber6541

   I presented this idea partly in jest -- but only partly.

   Crazier things have happened than either (a) McConnell misjudging at
   great expense to the country, or (b) Obama and/or Kerry avoiding this
   risk by successfully inviting McConnell to rise above (escape from) the
   fray.

     First, why would Mitch give up the opportunity to be Majority Leader
     for a powerless ambassadorship? Makes no sense.

   Does Mitch plan to die with his boots on? He's had a long run in the
   Senate. Now he risks a humiliating re-election defeat, after first
   being forced into a humiliating balancing/grovelling act.  I believe
   his wife's family background and career history should encourage her to
   see great value in such an ambassadorship.  If Mitch wants to live out
   his golden years in the most golden tier of the trans-Pacific elite,
   this would largely put him there.

     Second, no Republicans would ever go along with with it because a
     Democrat would appoint McConnell's replacement.

   I agree that his is the biggest barrier. But how many  Republicans
   besides Mitch would need to go along with it? Are they going to
   filibuster the appointment? What if the Governor made a deal to appoint
   Elaine Chao as the interim Senator?

     Finally, Kapur is just dead wrong. A government shutdown would
     DESTROY McConnell.

   Indeed, these are the key questions:
   (i) whether McConnell believes he can both avoid a government shutdown
   and also win re-election, and
   (ii) how close to the edge of a shutdown he can skate without all of us
   slipping over it.
   Kapur's article had some information that was not reassuring.

          [244]scamperdo, [245]Joe Bacon

   Even when Dowd says something intelligent, like the following from
   today's linked article:

     Some of the excitement about Barack Obama was the prospect of making
     a clean start... Yet Obama ushered in the return of Clinton Inc. and
     gave it his blessing.

   ... she cannot resist surrounding it with her condescending
   pop-psychologizing and assuming that nobody else is as smart as she is,
   like the following:

     Obama did not seem fully aware, with their cozy joint "60 Minutes"
     interview and their laughing al fresco lunch at the White House
     recently, that instead of co-opting Hillary, he looked like he was
     handing her the White House silver on a silver platter. The Clintons
     can present those images as Obama passing the torch and bypassing
     Joe Biden...

     ...What he doesn't seem to realize yet is that Hillary's first term
     will be seen, not as a continuation of Obama, but as Bill Clinton's
     third term.

   Even worse, while Dowd (in a break from sneering at Obama, and of
   course at most other people) acknowledges the following:

     [Obama's] White House runs on the idea that if you are virtuous and
     true and honorable, people will ultimately come to you. (An ethos
     that sometimes collides with political success.)

   The only way she can think of to respond to this admirable, if arguably
   naïve, approach, is to use it to tee up her unnecessarily spiteful
   comparison as follows:

     The Clintons are ends-justify-the-means types with flexible
     boundaries about right and wrong

   In contrast to the pressures and necessities faced by national
   candidates and officeholders, it seems clear that Maureen Dowd's own
   instinctive and persistent adoption of the position that
   "ends-justify-the-means" and of "flexible boundaries about right and
   wrong" in order to achieve the trademarked tone of her columns,
   reflects mere laziness.

   and the federal debt?

   Well, among other things, George Bush's medical choices, according to
   Vinay Prasad and Adam Cifu in the WaPo:

   [291]President Bush's unnecessary heart surgery

     Former president George W. Bush, widely regarded as a model of
     physical fitness, received a coronary artery stent on Tuesday. Few
     facts are known about the case, but what is known suggests the
     procedure was unnecessary.

     ...

     What value does a stress test add for an otherwise healthy
     67-year-old?No study has shown that this examination improves
     outcomes. The trials that have been done for so-called routine
     stress testing examined higher-risk patients. They found that
     performing stress tests on people at high risk of cardiovascular
     disease may detect blockages but does not improve symptoms or
     survival. Routine stress testing does, however, increase the use of
     procedures such as coronary stenting.

     Unfortunately, Mr. Bush, like many VIPs, may be paying the price of
     these in-depth investigations. His stress test revealed an
     abnormality, prompting another test: a CT angiogram. This study
     showed a blockage, which was stented open during an invasive
     procedure. It is worth noting that at least two large randomized
     trials show that stenting these sorts of lesions does not improve
     survival. Because Mr. Bush had no symptoms, it is impossible that he
     felt better after these procedures.

   On his assessment of The Economist and Bloomberg in terms of their
   nature and importance.

   The WSJ ceased to be the paper of record for the business community
   about 2 years after Murdoch bought them and the old guard of the
   editorial staff was replaced or bolted.

   Meanwhile, Bloomberg has parlayed what was an online information
   service to a very successful and profitable media empire, resurrecting
   Businessweek from the throes of death into a global publication that is
   the only competitor of The Economist, the difference being the daily
   news service of Bloomberg verses the very high quality blogs and
   international editorial perspective of The Economist.

   At least in the international market, both have eclipsed the WSJ, Time
   and (RIP) Newsweek.

   WSJ is now a dying print publication and a faltering online one with
   possible exception of All Things Digital, which still has excellent
   editorial content.

   What he gets right is the unique position the WaPo enjoys as the local
   paper of the capital city of the world's most powerful nation.

   I hope it gets saved and not butchered.

       websites in their respective cities.
       They just haven't been marketing or monetizing their websites very
       well.
       That's why I think Bezos will succeed and probably create a new
       model for a big city newspaper.

        Recommended by:

       Bezos only bought the Post . None of the other Properties.
       As a observer of the dying newspapers, I think Bezos has a unique
       opportunity to turn the nations local paper into one of
       international import with real investigative reporting where
       advertisers would be paying big bucks to reach mass audiences.
       The fact that Amazon  could literally give away a free subscription
       to the millions of new and old (discounted Subs)Kindle owners and
       have Amazon reimburse the Post  is something that probably crossed
       his mind. But first he would have to rebuild  the Washington Post
       into something that people would see as a huge plus ie that was
       worth money  so Amazon could actually make money on the millions of
       Kindles they sell for cost. Imagine that, a paper supported on sub
       income not beholden to advertisers. What kind of content would it
       take - other than porn - to make it worthwhile on a international
       basis for say tens of millions of subs?.
       Kindle prices have gone lower than an annual sub cost for the print
       version, so it's not too far away to imagine some facsimile of the
       above.
       He apparently was and is ready to take years of losses with Amazon
       , especially with a lofty share price that made him very rich. It
       will be interesting to see if he'll put in own capital to burn so
       that the Post could  rebuild staff, equipment , worldwide locations
       with (gulp) real reporters so it could once again be a cash cow
       while keeping his hands off the editorial side.
       As Andy Rooney said to the powers that be at CBS, before he died :
       "Please don't hire Katie Couric. We could hire 250 real reporters
       for that kind of money".
       No one listens to the old folks anymore. What a true clusterfuck
       that was for the Network of Edward Murrow and Mike Wallace.
       One should also note why he saw an opportunity here. Netflix stock
       was pummeled last year when it tried to raise prices and then
       started to invest in quality original programming. Now the stock
       price is getting close  to it's all time high because the strategy
       appears to be bearing fruit.
       Amazon has to be very careful right now with buying more "stuff"
       that will burn money. It seems natural that Bezos would do it, turn
       it into new media and sell it to Amazon once it was a net positive
       contributor to income.

   Content isn't WaPo's problem, with regards to profitability anyway.

   I'm sure WaPo gets the kind of hits any other big city paper could only
   dream of.

   Their problem is the same as Douthat's -- they don't know a damn thing
   about selling things to those viewers.

   For example, how did Craig's List take away all their classifieds and
   what answers do they have to get it back.

   For another, why aren't they selling products through their websites
   instead of just ads.

   For another thing, how did the coupon websites attract so many local
   merchants and what can they do to get them back.

   Bezos knows how to play the game, journalists are mostly clueless.

       the Bezos knows how to play the online game is hardly the same as
       knowing how to put out a quality newspaper.
       It used to be accepted wisdom that someone who succeeded in running
       one type of business could do so with all kinds of different
       businesses.  That management skills were interchangeable between
       industries, retail and manufacturing, etc.  Not true.
       One of the areas where loss of large metropolitan dailies is really
       hurting us, but we don't seem to take notice of it, is in the loss
       of overseas bureaus staffed with people who really knew the

   Recommended by:

   OF COURSE WaPo missed out!  I'm not going to parse Douthat under any
   circumstances...but I guess I agree with a stopped clock like Ross.

   In January 2012, Douthat came down stridently on established custom &
   practice when the American Council of Bishops made a move to object to
   Obamacare's requirement that birth control coverage, sterilization
   etc., be made available by Catholic-owned or Catholic-run hospitals.

   Ross wrote, "...The new health care law requires that all
   employer-provided insurance plans cover contraception, sterilization
   and the morning-after (or week-after) pill known as ella, which can
   work as an abortifacient. A number of religious groups, led by the
   American Catholic bishops, had requested an exemption for plans
   purchased by their institutions. Instead, the White House has settled
   on an exemption that only covers religious institutions that primarily
   serve members of their own faith. A parish would be exempt from the
   mandate, in other words, but a Catholic hospital would not...."

   And he ssid it without a word that this is the way they rolled until
   the WH sought to put it into a law that had been passed two years
   before!

   [508]John Cole reflects my opinion of Douthat every day: "...from where
   I stand these days, the only thing I see religion doing in the public
   sector is gay bashing and telling women, mostly poor and desperate and
   in deplorable financial and personal situations, what to do with their
   bodies. I see busybodies deciding what drugs they can dispense to which
   customers, or deciding that they don't have to issue a marriage license
   because of some petty deity that I don't believe in told them to hate
   their fellow citizens and ignore the law. In a country in dire
   financial straits but still spending billions and billions of dollars
   on education, I see religious folks actively and openly working to make
   our schoolkids dumber. I see them shooting people who provided a
   medical procedure, and I see others rummaging through people's personal
   lives to find out who hasn't lived up the word of God. I see
   glassy-eyed fools running for President claiming that vaccines that
   save lives actually cause cancer, or that if you get raped and are
   pregnant, you should just lie back and think of Jeebus and make the
   best of a bad situation. In fact, everywhere you look these days, if
   Christianity or religion is getting a mention, it means something ugly
   is happening and someone somewhere is being victimized, marginalized,
   or otherwise abused. Go read some of the arguments against integration
   and you'll see the same bible verses used today against homosexuals.
   Fifty years from now, they'll be recycling them again to trash someone
   else they don't like or who isn't good enough for them...."

   The newspaper business is lucky if it fails.

   (Why do some people call it "Politico" and some "The Politico?"
   Enquiring minds want to know?)

   Is there a single more cynical outlet than Politico? At least the major
   newspapers still pretend there are actual policy issues and human
   concerns under the glossy, grimy surface of horse race politics.  For
   Politico, it's all about cynicism.  Every person in politics is in it
   for the money and the personal power, and that is treated as the normal
   state of American affairs.  It's also, go figure, increasingly true.

   I for one am really psyched to see Bezos buy the Post.  It was on a
   downhill slide for years.  It couldn't possibly be much worse.

 Bezos the American Murdoch; WaPo to remain bozos ([526]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [527]harris stein

   The WaPo's failure to become digitally the paper of record for the
   nation was not due to the departure of the bozos who started Politico,
   the gossip tabloid sheet that doesn't whatsoever pass the smell test
   for national relevance or serious journalism.  Politico is a morning
   cartoon show for the insider shallow giggly courtier press of
   Versailles on the Potomac.

   The WaPo could have succeeded in being the national paper of record,
   moreso than than the NYT, if its editorial page hadn't been a clownish
   clone of the WSJ's editorial page.  For such success, the Post's
   editorial page needed to have been viewed as more evenhanded and, well,
   actually more intelligent than it actually is, which is a failing of
   its editorial page editor, John Hiatt, who constantly sacrifices his
   editorial pages and his own intelligence on the altar of lowest-common
   denominator wingnut-ism that even moderate conservatives know to be a
   fever swamp of neocon bullshit and cynical sophism.

   Bezos will retain Hiatt because Bezos is an anti-union sweatshop owner,
   who wants to make all nations subject to a prevailing unchallengeable
   corporatism.  Wait and see, Bezo is an American Murdoch.  So the old
   Washington Post bozos are being replaced by its new owner, Bezos.

   No, Andrew, I'm just a little crazy but not stupid.

     Second, despite the grumbling from Snowden and his admirers, the
     U.S. government truly does make strenuous efforts not to violate
     privacy, not just because it respects privacy (which it does), but
     because it simply doesn't have the time to read irrelevant emails or
     listen in on conversations unconnected to possible plots against
     American civilians.

   Truth be told I don't admire Snowden, but I do thank him for his noble
   intellect and I do hope the borscht, potatoes, and sausage is
   tolerable. The truth is that the blanket sweeping up of data and
   content of anyone, anywhere in the world who uses a digital
   communications device is illegal Andrew. How do I know this? The 4th
   Amendment of the US Constitution says so. It's that simple.

   Not only do I not admire Snowden, I don't admire you or anyone who
   works in any kind of secret information gathering capacity. They have
   sold their souls to the devil for a few pieces of silver that has bound
   them with golden handcuffs for their entire lives.
