[68]Obama says U.S. 'deplores' Egyptian violence

   politicalmugshot
   Posted by
   [69]CNN Political Unit

   (CNN) - President Obama said Thursday the United States "deplores" the
   violence against civilians in the recent Egyptian military crackdown
   against protests in Cairo.

   He said the United States believes the Egyptian government's "state of
   emergency should be lifted" and a process of reconciliation must begin.

   He also announced the cancellation of Bright Star - next month's joint
   U.S.-Egyptian military exercise.

       in other news, Oreilly has a new book out called "Killing America;
       the facts of the failed obama presidency".....NYT best seller too.
       ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
       Yeah, those "bulk" purchases are notorious for pushing tabloid
       trash to the top of the list.. Then the books sit in boxes in a
       warehouse somewhere. Happens quite frequently with rags authored by
       reichwing cretins.

       I'm so tired of listening to this man speak. There are certain
       things that, we as a nation, do not need updates or a stance on. I
       believe that this subject is one of them. Give the people of Egypt
       a chance to figure this one out on their own.

       But then your ilk will be outraged that he's not looking out for
       "America's interests abroad". Face it, as far as your ilk is
       concerned, he's danged if he does/danged if he doesn't.

       I kinda wish the US had "stayed out" of peaceful Egypt and turned
       it into a muslim brotherhood regime - I had wanted to go see the
       pyramids and all the old antiquity - - Guess Not - - now its is
       screwed up - - and I can't go to Pakistan either anymore - -

       Oh joy we get to listen to another 30+ minute dissertation on
       Nothing. How about just stop spending Billions on a broken system
       over there and start focusing on education, infrastructure and our
       own economic issues. In today's world I don't buy the age old adage
       "He who controls the Suez Controls the Oil and Trade!"

       the problem is that in the mideast with the exception of Israel,
       democracy means voting for a new dictator who be in office forever.
       There is no such thing as a democracy ala, Western Europe or the
       US. Our state department supported revolutions in Egypt, Libya and
       even in Syria however these were not the same kind of rebels that
       were around during the American Revolution. These midEastern
       rebeles are merely people fighting for their own fascist, jihdist
       ideals and we helped them. We should have learned from Afgansitan
       when we supported the Taliban many years ago to only find that we
       supported our enemies who had no clue as to what democracy is all
       about.

       Glad the POTUS could take time off from his 100th vacation to
       actually do his job. How come these politicians get so much
       vacation time when they are so important? Obama and Congress have
       done nothing to deserve such lavish vacation time. Public service?
       More like self-service...

       Oh, Obama's vacation has lasted that long? He truly is horrible,
       huh?
       ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
       Actually, President Obama has taken less "vacation" time than any
       other President in modern history, but don't let the facts stand in
       your way. Meanwhile, howsabout you provide some credible examples
       of the "horrible" things President Obama has done?

       No one in Egypt should care about what Obama, the supporter and
       ally of the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood, thinks.

       This situation saddens my heart, We should all focus our energy on
       Egypt and send prayers their way - I believe in the power of prayer
       over any other measure we think we have created that we think is
       stronger to counter violence and oppression.

       I can only speculate of course, but for some reason I think the
       speech is going to be, "The United States condemns the violence and
       attempts to thwart true democracy. We are committed to standing
       with our allies in the...." You know, like we've heard from every
       U.S. President since Eisenhower. How refreshing it would be to hear
       a President say, "You know,we of course condemn the violence, but
       it's really not our place to meddle. Goodness knows we've got
       plenty of our own problems Plus, we've been meddling in
       international affairs for far too long and frankly it's been a huge
       failure. We're staying out of this one."'

       sounds like vacation is more important than the crisis that are
       happening all over the world..... wow.

       No needs for remark, the world does not consider US an world leader
       any more. If the we want to lead the world again, we can not be
       just a talking tiger, we need to be a role model taking care of our
       own political problems in a right way in right direction.
       Double-standard has been one of our basic problems.

       Yeah, except neither place has been stable or safe for Americans,
       and the State Department has issued travel warnings on both places
       since long before January 20, 2009. Time to take your little
       strawman and go back to school.

       I'm surprised that Obama found the time comment on the crisis in
       Egypt. Seems like all he ever does is play Spades (prison card
       game) and golf.

       Boy - some of you just don't get it. Egypt is the only moderate
       state in the middle east or, at least, the only one who has made
       peace with Israel. If we allow the radical extremist to take over,
       that will go by the wayside and there will be even bigger problems
       in the middle east - possibly a major war with Israel, which will
       drag us in. Unfortunately, most right-wingers have never really
       understood the art of diplomacy or why it's needed.

       If figures that the GOP supports Morsy and his Muslim brotherhood
       against the now obvious coup. The GOP is just like the Brotherhood
       wanting to establish a fundamentalist theocracy right here in
       America. Morsy is a "conservative" - just like the GOP. I suspect
       what we see here is a sort of projection. The GOP is right on that
       line of treasonous, anti-American behavior, and they don't wish to
       wind up like the Brotherhood now in Egypt.
