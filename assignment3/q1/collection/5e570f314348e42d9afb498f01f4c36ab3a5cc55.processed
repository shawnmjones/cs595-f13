     * [32]Louisiana legislators defeat bill to cut oil spill dispersants.
       The state senate didn't vote against requiring oil companies to
       spray spills with nontoxic alternatives to poisonous dispersants
       like Corexit. It voted against a bill that merely sought to
       encourage the companies to use alternatives. When you're in the oil
       companies' pocket, you're in deep.

     * [34]Wikipedia editors go on vendetta against critic. Amanda
       Filipacchi got so irked by the on-line encyclopedia's moving women
       writers from the "American Novelists" category into a subcategory
       of American Women Novelists that she wrote an [35]Op-Ed about it.
       And Wikipedia struck back:

     As soon as the Op-Ed article appeared, unhappy Wikipedia editors
     pounced on my Wikipedia page and started making alterations to it,
     erasing as much as they possibly could without (I assume)
     technically breaking the rules. They removed the links to outside
     sources, like interviews of me and reviews of my novels. Not
     surprisingly, they also removed the link to the Op-Ed article. At
     the same time, they put up a banner at the top of my page saying the
     page needed "additional citations for verifications." Too bad they'd
     just taken out the useful sources.

     In 24 hours, there were 22 changes to my page. Before that, there
     had been 22 changes in four years. Thursday night, a kind soul went
     in there and put back the deleted sources. The Wiki editors
     instantly took them out again.

     TOM CORBETT: The other area is, there are many employers that say
     we're looking for people but we can't find anybody that has passed a
     drug test, a lot of them. And that's a concern for me because we're
     having a serious problem with that.
       A Quinnipiac Poll [37]shows Corbett trailing his potential
       Democratic opponents by nine points or more.
     * [38]Authorities confiscate and treat 300 gallons of urine from

     house on Berkshire Road they found "200 to 300 one-gallon plastic
     jugs" filled with urine, [spokesman Dennis] Schain said. [...] The
     urine was sent to be treated at a sewage-treatment plant.
     * Voters in Massachusetts today are going to the polls to select
       nominees for the Senate special election prompted by John Kerry's
       confirmation as Secretary of State earlier this year. On the
       Democratic side, voters are choosing between Reps. Ed Markey and
       Stephen Lynch, while Republicans have three  candidates to pick
       from: former U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan, businessman Gabriel
       Gomez, and state Rep. Dan Winslow. (The general election will take
       place on June 25.) Polls close at 8pm ET, and we'll be liveblogging
       the results at [39]Daily Kos Elections.
     * [40]Austerity finally getting wider attention as abject failure:

     For anyone who wants to know the origins and intellectual
     foundations of the wavering austerity crowd, Mark Blyth's
     devastating new book, Austerity: History of a Dangerous Idea, is
     one-stop shopping. Unlike most previous critics, Blyth's angle of
     attack is not rapier thrusts into the heart of this or that
     pro-austerity paper, it is an all-out, search-and-destroy mission
     against every argument these latter-day financial terrorists have
     mustered.
     * [41]Study including an eco-message in marketing cuts sales of
       efficient light-bulbs:

     The [42]study then presented participants with a real-world choice:
     With a fixed amount of money in their wallet, respondents had to
     "buy" either an old-school light bulb or an efficient compact
     florescent bulb, the same kind [Rep. Michele] Bachmann railed
     against. Both bulbs were labeled with basic hard data on their
     energy use, but without a translation of that into climate pros and
     cons. When the bulbs cost the same, and even when the CFL cost more,
     conservatives and liberals were equally likely to buy the efficient
     bulb. But slap a message on the CFL's packaging that says "Protect
     the Environment," and "we saw a significant drop-off in more
     politically moderates and conservatives choosing that option," said
     study author Dena Gromet, a researcher at the University of
     Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [59]Civil
   Rights, [60]Community, [61]Congress, [62]Culture, [63]Economy,
   [64]Education, [65]Elections, [66]Energy, [67]Environment, [68]Health
   Care, [69]International, [70]Labor, [71]Law, [72]Media, [73]Meta,
   [74]National Security, [75]Science, [76]Transportation, or [77]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([78]California, [79]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     Facebook Rejects Ad Highlighting Zuckerberg Group's Support For
     Keystone XL

     When a subsidiary of Mark Zuckerberg's new political group started
     airing ads for expanded oil drilling and the construction of the
     Keystone XL pipeline, CREDO Action decided to post an ad of their
     own calling Zuckerberg out -- on Facebook.

     This morning, Facebook rejected CREDO's Facebook ad (pictured
     right). According to CREDO Action, Facebook initially informed them
     they rejected the ad because it used Facebook trademarks --
     specifically, Zuckerberg's image. Though the image used was fully
     licensed for creative commons use, a Facebook representative told
     ThinkProgress that any images of Zuckerberg are off-limits, as he is
     part of the Facebook brand. The rules governing Facebook brand usage
     specify "trademarks, names, domain names, logos" but does not
     explicitly restrict images of Zuckerberg.

     Zuckerberg's group, FWD.US, is ostensibly focused on passing
     comprehensive immigration reform, with long-term goals of expanding
     scientific research and reforming education. However, the group soon
     started funding ads promoting oil drilling in the Arctic National
     Wildlife Refuge and constructing the Keystone XL pipeline. In the
     past, Zuckerberg has called for reducing fossil fuel usage in favor
     of more clean energy sources. FWD.US defended the ads as a way to
     shore up vulnerable Republican lawmakers who support immigration
     reform.

 Background check expansion or trick? ([252]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [253]Angie in WA State, [254]OLinda

     WASHINGTON -- Getting a background check to buy a gun would be as
     easy as printing out an airplane boarding pass -- if Sen. Tom Coburn
     has his way.

     Coburn's do-it-yourself background check plan -- which would expand
     the number of gun sales covered by background checks but also
     attempt to make them more user-friendly -- is one possible path
     forward for the gun safety legislation now stalled in the Senate.
     Last week, 41 Republicans and five Democrats voted to block a
     compromise background check proposal endorsed by many gun control
     groups but opposed by the National Rifle Association.

 There is one major "austerity" mind-bender, though ([264]0+ / 0-)

   George Bush is roundly assailed for screwing up the economy.  He did,
   however, do a couple of things that seem to fit in with the current
   Democratic dogma in weird bizarro-world kind of a way:

   1.  He invaded Iraq and Afghanistan

   Huge federal spending program, not to mention jobs program.

   2.  He refused to raise taxes to pay for it

   So he was not "austerity-minded" and deficit averse.  The post 9/11
   economy did suffer, especially those industries connected with air
   travel.  He became a Keynesian without ever acknowledging it.

   The mind-bender is this:  How do you keep bashing Bush economics while,
   for all intents and purposes, proposing that we take Bushonomics and
   run wild with it?

       The wars were a huge crony-capitalist jobs program - maily for the
       1% and their ilk who reaped billions - the majority of whom are
       probably tax-avoiders (or wannabe tax-avoiders).
       If you put the same money to work in the US economy by creating
       honest mid-wage jobs, it would have put billions back into the US
       Govenrment in taxes.  The investment would likely even pay for
       itself in time.

 Not remotely false. ([282]0+ / 0-)
       Your comments, in fact, verge on silly.
       I say verge on only because you are right in this fundamental way:
       war as an economic stimulus programs works, but is not inefficient.

       No matter how many buzzwords you feel to throw around
       (crony-capital) to prove your left-side credentials, the wars DID
       manage to employ hundreds of thousands of soldiers.  Of special
       note are the extended tours of National Guardsmen, leaving spots
       available at home for others to fill.
       Construction materials, meals, ordinance, fuel, vehicles, razor
       blads, USO tours, etc, etc, etc generated jobs.
       At the same time, the refusal to increase taxes left money in
       consumer pockets.
       It was  giant Keynesian program.
       It was a crappy Keynesian program, but, if you ignore the killing
       and maiming, it wasn't that much worse than the so-called stimulus
       program enacted when the current administration came to town.

 Hmmmm ([296]0+ / 0-)

   Nobody's calling for "Bushonomics" at all. Deficits are useful in some
   economic conditions, not in others. When Bush was running major
   deficits, they were not appropriate because we did not need a solution
   to an economic crisis that hadn't happened yet.

   Republicans...think the American standard of living is a fine thing--so
   long as it doesn't spread to all the people. And they admire the
   Government of the United States so much that they would like to buy it.

 Closer...but not quite right. ([300]0+ / 0-)
       Go check the numbers.
       The internet bubble had burst and Bush came in at a time of anemic
       growth -- even negative growth -- and then got slammed with the
       effects of 9/11.
       It was actually a good time to consider a little deficit spending.
       The economy might have performed much more poorly had he been
       unwilling to run up the deficit.
       He probably could have done much better with much less had he
       purposefully set out to do so, but, hey, Keynesian effects are
       Keynesian effects even when you don't like the way they'r done.
       And -- your point is well-taken.  After the big dose of deficit
       spending under Bush, followed by the "stimulus" bill, what creates
       a certainty that more deficit spending will have a significant
       impact now?
       Trick question, actually.
       I believe that it could do a lot of good, but only if it were
       orders of magnitude more thoughtful than the 2009 bill, and I'm
       incredibly skeptical that our leaders are capable of such a thing.

       There are (still) millions of them, although not so many are active
       now. Anyone with an IP address can be an editor. Assigning the
       actions of one to the body as a whole, and in the Times no less,
       shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the process.
       Furthermore, the system as a whole has a self-correcting tendency,
       as many believed at the beginning and many others doubted. (it's a
       tendency only; some of the writing is still awful). I have no doubt
       any retaliation has been reverted.
       As it happens, her complaint has done some good. There's now a
       vigorous, multi-page debate about the inadequacies of the
       categorization system and some of the finer points of its multiple
       layers (do you categorize Dickens as a historical novelist, because
       of Tale of Two Cities, and as a novelist? Do you characterize
       people who are primarily known for science fiction as novelists?
       And how do we handle the splitting of categories consistently? What
       about people who do not identify as a gender? And is it still
       tenable that a category should contain either only articles or only
       subcategories?) And the original editor who led the splitting out
       of American Women Novelists has explained his reasoning and joined
       in the debate.
       The Sunday Times article was misleading, ill-researched, and
       self-serving.

       It's a sorting category. It doesn't imply that women writers are
       inferior to male writers. It is just a listing of novelists who are
       female.

 She was saying that the listing of ([332]0+ / 0-)

       isn't an issue at this moment. The list of American Novelists
       includes both men and women.

 And even that was untrue ([336]0+ / 0-)
       Only some women writers were moved into the new category (it's not
       something that can be done in bulk; the active editor stopped
       short). And now the restoration has at least one Women's
       Studies-oriented editor saying that the separate categorization
       helps with her research. And there are six proposals being actively
       discussed, including status quo and "wymyn only" as options, with
       reasoning and pros and cons being put forward rather than just
       "that was wrong".
       And the whole meta-discussion about categorization mechanics.
       It's like the liberal college faculty meeting from hell. Sometimes
       the minutiae get thrashed so endlessly that you just want to stab

   Ember's 15 years old, and sometimes seems to be a puppy again - she'll

   She'd dodge, bounce, jump and keep her eyes on her invisible "foe" -
   and then, when she's "won," she'd act the way she used to when she was
   signalling that she'd had enough.
