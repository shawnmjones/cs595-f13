Supreme Court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act

   Associated Press

   In a breakthrough legal victory, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this
   morning that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional. In a 5-4
   ruling, the court majority said the anti-gay law is discriminatory:
   "DOMA singles out a class of persons deemed by a State entitled to
   recognition and protection to enhance their own liberty."

   The decision was written by Justice Kennedy, who was joined by Justices
   Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. More soon.

   First Update: The full ruling is online [3]here (pdf); the Scotusblog
   description of the case is [4]here; and previous MaddowBlog coverage is
   [5]here.

   Second Update: From the ruling: DOMA is "unconstitutional as a
   deprivation of the equal liberty of persons that is protected by the
   Fifth Amendment."

   Third Update: Pete Williams' initial read suggests this ruling is
   "[6]broad" enough for marriage-equality proponents "to attack laws in
   other states."

   Fourth Update: Some of the reach of the ruling will depend on a deeper
   analysis of the decision itself, but keep in mind that the end of DOMA
   will have significant consequences. The Defense Department, for
   example, ended DADT, but could not apply equal benefits to gay
   servicemembers because of this law. Now that it's been struck down,
   it's no longer an issue.

   Fifth Update: It's worth clarifying that the DOMA ruling does not
   extend marriage equality to all 50 states, but rather, as Amy Howe
   explained on Scotusblog, that "same-sex couples who are legally married
   will be entitled to equal treatment under federal law-- with regard to,
   for example, income taxes and Social Security benefits."

   Sixth Update: The other major Supreme Court case on gay rights was a
   challenge to California's Prop 8. In this case, Chief Justice John
   Roberts and the court majority punted on procedural grounds, saying the
   defendants lacked the standing needed to defend the case in court. The
   full ruling is online [7]here (pdf).

   Seventh Update: From Scotusblog's summary of this morning's Prop 8
   ruling in Perry:  "After the two same-sex couples filed their challenge
   to Proposition 8 in federal court in California, the California
   government officials who would normally have defended the law in court,
   declined to do so. So the proponents of Proposition 8 stepped in to
   defend the law, and the California Supreme Court (in response to a
   request by the lower court) ruled that they could do so under state
   law. But today the Supreme Court held that the proponents do not have
   the legal right to defend the law in court. As a result, it held, the
   decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the
   intermediate appellate court, has no legal force, and it sent the case
   back to that court with instructions for it to dismiss the case."

   Eighth Update: The Prop 8 ruling was 5-4, but not along traditional
   ideological lines. The majority included Justices Roberts, Scalia,
   Breyer, Ginsburg, and Kagan. An unexpected combination, to be sure.

   YAY!!!

   The SCOTUS strikes down DOMA!

   So, that now mean that gay couples can now get legally married, and/or
   have their marriages, and all rights, recognized in all 50 states?

   But does yesterday's Shelby ruling now allow states to, while
   acknowledging gay marriages, suppress the rights of gays to vote?

   Let's see what happens on Prop 8.

   No, this does not mean gay couples can legally get married. This just
   means that any gay couple that gets married in a state where it is
   legal is entitled to the same federal benefits as a married straight
   couple. This particular ruling does nothing to change the legality of
   gay marriage in the individual states.

   As I understand it, the answer to your first question is NO. The DOMA
   challenge arose when a woman legally married to another woman in their
   state lost her married partner when she died. Under normal, married
   observance, assets would pass to the surviving married partner free of
   tax. With DOMA in place, they were NOT recognized as legally married
   and the surviving married partner was given a tax bill for over $300K.
   She brought suit, and today she won.

   The decision basically said that DOMA is unconstitutional, and that the
   Federal government has to recognize legal marriages, period.

   Where the interesting downstream effect is going to be is this: it's
   legal to get married in 12 states (I believe) right now. So the
   question would be, if a same sex couple is legally married in a state
   that recognizes marriage equality moves to a state where it is NOT
   legal, can they sue the new state on that basis to recognize the
   legality of that marriage? It has certainly opened the door - wide.

   The scuttlebutt is that SCOTUS ruled in the PropH8 case that the
   plaintiff didn't have standing. The plaintiff, a heterosexual marriage
   partner, essentially declared that they were harmed by the existence of
   marriage equality. SCOTUS held that they did not have standing, which
   validates the idea that they were NOT harmed. Bottom line: marriage
   equality doesn't harm so-called "traditionally" married persons. Pretty
   monumental.

   - I'm pretty sure you're wrong about that last part. SCOTUS ruled that
   the Proponents of Prop 8 had no legal standing to appeal the initial
   ruling which struck down Prop 8 in California (since the State of
   California decided not to appeal the ruling, a group of citizens filed
   an appeal instead). Since SCOTUS decided they had no legal standing to
   appeal the case, they remanded the case back to the appeals court with
   instructions to dismiss the appeal. Hence, the original ruling by the
   lower court (that prop 8 was unconstitutional) will stand in
   California. Since SCOTUS didn't rule on the merits of the case, but
   rather on procedure, it doesn't set any sort of nationwide precedent,
   by my understanding anyway.

   The basic gist of the DOMA decision is simple - if your state says you
   are married, the Federal government cannot treat you as though you are
   not.

   This does not make gay marriage legal in all 50 states. But in the
   states where it is legal, it must be recognized by Federal law.

   @[55]ardichoke:

   You and [56]Rena RF are both right. It doesn't strike down laws banning
   same-sex marriage, but it does bluntly state that same-sex marriage
   does not harm opposite-sex marriage in a way that allows legal remedy
   under the constitution. That completely destroys massive sections of
   the arguments that are used to legally deny same-sex couples marriage
   rights. The court still punted the ball hard on the Prop 8 case, but
   the punt will most likely be recovered by liberals.

   In conjunction with the DOMA ruling, it greatly moves the process
   forward of giving full marriage rights to all people.

   Text needed for the dissenting opinion, the political content there of.

   [61]Comment author avatar [62]RichMJones@rcn.com

   Roughly 24,146 words, Ruling 9,516 words, dissenting 14,630 words

   The Congress passed a law for political reasons; the Constitution
   should have a special category for such laws to keep them from harming
   the public.

   This implies that Congress in passing laws is ignorant of the
   Constitution, ignores the Constitution, and misinterprets the
   Constitution.

   This implies that may be Congress should attend classes in law taught
   by the Supreme Court Justices, but that could compound the problem for
   certain.

   In reading the dissenting opinion we see all the failed term papers
   submitted when in law school.

   This implies that any referencing of non-law sources would reduce
   volume of words by 3/5ths, The Bible, German law, well-traveled authors
   opinions, polls, gravity, and reputed laws of nature, personal notes
   should disallowed sticking with the law.

   Had any of these things been done, and done well DOMA law would have
   not wasted time in being passed, its banner disappearing from the
   grandstand after parade.

   But again, someday we will have a case where any one of the 50 States
   cannot pass useful laws for its own State, but that are written to
   affect the other 49 States. When this is the case the States have
   failed in making State laws forfeit the law making power back to the
   federal level. For example one State may deregulate its fire protection
   codes, allowing vehicles licensed in that State to carry dangerous
   products into adjacent State. But just moment, those States are
   represented in the Senate and the House who could see it as their
   responsibility to promote commerce and to standardize regulations. The
   nation grows such that those licensed State vehicles, can reach with
   great frequency other States, and sales of dangerous but cheaper
   products, booms. This essential attacks 49 other State having fire
   protection codes, from competing across the country (commercial
   anarchy).

   The point is that the separation of powers gives a States the
   opportunity to do at the State level what can best be done at the State
   level, while the federal powers do best what needs to be done uniformly
   for all States. This might be called the efficiency clause. No State
   fire department is practical, since the function belongs to the
   community, but having uniform fire hoses for adjacent communities make
   State codes efficient. There is never going to be a federal fire
   department, but more because going 3,000 miles in ten minutes is less
   practical than even Congress can imagine.

   If the Court is going to descent siting separation of powers arguments
   then given the easy of movement between States, then uniform efficient
   laws can reduce the cost whatever it was Congress was making efficient.
   Now just apply that to marriage???? It makes no sense to assume
   otherwise, since has no purpose, yet if the 1,000 marriage laws in each
   State were to be reduced to mere 1,000 for all States some efficiency
   is obtained.

   This (above) is barely interesting, but in who's interest is that a
   federal government, and 50 State governments, and 10,000 city
   governments all pass different (inefficient laws)?????????? Shall we
   mention the full employment act for lawyers?

   So what kind of government do we have? If not 'of the lawyers, by the
   lawyers, and for the lawyers', then one that benefits who need to help
   people in producing prosperity, or one that taxed everyone to support
   lawyers?

   We like to pay lawyers to get things done, but electing them to be
   Congressman, Senators, and Supreme Court Justices, is to pay them for
   not getting things done.

   Everyone is all for using the Constitution to guide the country
   forward, even allowing it to be amended, but would we (today) really
   want the Congress, Senate or States to amend the Constitution just turn
   it over the Supreme Court, to solicit their failed school boy term
   papers?

   Well, one excellent and one meh. Ditching Prop8 on standing was an
   anticipated "there's no way to strike down the lower court's decision,
   because Judge Walker prepared it too well. Therefore, minimize the
   damage by letting it die at the State level" compromise.

   Thomas and the others might have preferred to play havoc with the
   findings of fact, but Kennedy and Roberts (at minimum) would gag on
   that as being too flagrant -- especially after yesterday. The VRA

   Just for clarification's sake, because I haven't been able to find an

   I find that so interesting because to me that is the MOST
   unconstitutional part of DOMA. Unless I'm mistaken I don't know of any
   other contract between two people that happens in one State, where
   another state is allowed to not recognize it...I thought that was one
   of the very fundamental basics of the way out Federal system works is
   that States are compelled to recognize legal contracts entered into in
   other States.

   Joe, I agree.

   Someone please clarify this for Joe and me! What I have read is that
   the entire law is struck down as unconstitutional.

   So if I am legal to drive in Minnesota at age 16, I am legal to drive
   in a different state even if the legal age is 17 or 18. If I get
   married in Nevada, that marriage is recognized in Minnesota. I believe
   this is covered in Amend XIV and the "Full Faith and Credit" parts of
   the Constitution. So, if my same-sex marriage that I get in
   Massachusetts is legal there, then it should be legal in Wisconsin.
   DOMA was the only thing standing in the way.

   But that is dead and gone now. Right?

   Having read the SCOTUS ruling, I got the distinct impression that Prop
   8 was ruled unconstitutional by a lower court and the proponents of
   Prop 8 were trying to appeal that decision to the SCOTUS.

   The ruling by SCOTUS was that the proponents of Prop 8 did not have
   standing to appeal the lower courts decision to the SCOTUS.

   In effect, the ruling by the lower court that Prop 8 is
   unconstitutional stands.

   Of course, I could have read the thing wrong, but that's what I got out
   of it.

   Funny how Roberts, Scalia, Alito and Thomas thought that Congress had
   every right to pass DOMA and they shouldn't touch it, but did not have
   the right to pass the Voting Rights Act and had to strike it down,
   without even mentioning which part of the Constitution it violatted.

   Both sets of decisions make sense if you're Roberts. He's young, and
   long before he leaves the Court (probably feet first) the PoG's "wedge
   issues" of the 90s (gays) and of the 2000s (gay marriage) will have
   become major liabilities to the Party. Getting those into "non-issue"
   territory and down the memory hole as soon as possible will, over the
   career of a Chief Justice, be the best thing for the Party.

   Unlike other Republican politicians, he doesn't have to worry about
   primary challenges and in general the short-term needs of re-election.

   On the other hand, unlimited money in politics (Citizens United) and
   voter suppression (yesterday with the VRA) are going to be essential to
   keeping the Republicans out of the midden for quite a few years --
   especially at the Presidential level, where Obama's successors will be
   appointing the Associate Justices who might make all the difference on
   the Court that he heads for the rest of his life.

   So he's thinking in the long term, and picking his battles carefully to
   maximize the benefit. Not the benefit to the Tony Perkins set, but to
   the Republican Party that is his first allegiance, and not for the next
   election cycle but rather for the next two or three decades.

   What kills me that it was 5 to 4.

   Something that was as obviously unconstitutional as DOMA was, should
   have seen a better number than that.

   The dissenting opinion rambles from not wanting to hear the case at
   all, to what our founders "left out" of the Constitution, and some bit
   about the Line Item Veto.

     The constitution does not gurantee the right to enter into a same
     sex marriage. Indeed, no provision of the Constitution speaks to the
     issue.

   Right. Because the Constitution was not written to regulate marriage.
   Irregardless of what the founders were thinking, the rights of man was
   the primary intent. The belief that we are all equal, and that no one
   should make law creating a distinction in order to deny those rights to
   others.

   I just love how some people like to just run ruff-shod over the Ninth
   Amendment, which actually does directly speak to the fact that The
   Constitution does speak to these things. Because if the Ninth didn't
   speak to these things there would be no Constitutional right to any
   kind of marriage.

   While this is great - awesome, actually - I was expecting a 7-2

   that is going to stop Scalia from being a butt-head and I expect some
   of the Judges to be more "traditional" in their values - but 5-4? This
   was a very slim margin for something that had to be delegated by a fair

   Actually, there's a very dangerous common thread in the two decisions.
   Both rested on SCOTUS's determination to protect the rights of states
   -- not individuals, states -- against the federal government. The
   result in the DOMA case was great -- the decision when you really read
   it may not be. Despite great rhetoric about how wrong it is for
   discrimination to be enshrined in the federal code, at its heart, the
   decision rests on, and is all about protecting state sovereignty and
   the right of states to control marriage in their states without federal
   interference. That state's right bias was also at the heart of
   yesterday's decision effectively putting a knife through the heart of
   federal "interference" with states' "right" to control access to the
   voting booth.

   So let's celebrate, but remember that what was won today is still
   subject to the winds of the political changes in states legislatures,
   not a right enshrined in the Constitution. The work toward that day
   continues.

   No, you dumbass. It's not the same.

   It's about consenting adults deciding that they love each other too
   much to be just boyfriends, girlfriends, or
   non-traditionally-binary-couples, and they want to be husbands, wives,
   or whatever non-traditionally-binary-couples would call each other.

   Polygamy opens a whole legal can of worms so screw that.

   Incest is a whole different bag of cats.

   Bestiality and pedophilia have non-consent as the main aspect of those
   kinds of abusive relationships.

   I'm not a lawyer, but I'm game to take your question seriously, even if
   you are just trolling. The yardstick that is typically used for what
   the government can and can't regulate is "compelling interest." The
   government does not have a compelling interest in preventing same-sex
   marriages between consenting adults. It does, however, have a
   compelling interest in protecting minors and other entities who cannot
   give informed consent (hence rules against marrying a minor, or your
   dog), and it has a compelling interest to prevent genetic defects in
   the population (hence rules against incest). Whether or not there is a
   compelling interest in preventing polygamy will probably be the next
   big marriage debate -- many would argue that the legal problems that
   arise from having multiple spouses (such as inheritance issues) and,
   presumably, having children from one marriage with multiple parents are
   indeed a compelling interest that the government should take steps to
   prevent.

   Most of what you say is logically sustainable, but your conclusions are
   wrong.

   The government does have a legitimate interest in preventing genetic
   issues that arise from incest occurring in large sections of the
   population, however that interest only goes as far as saying that
   incestuous relationships can not produce biological children. However a
   blanket ban on incestuous marriage or relationships because those
   states of being can not produce viable biological children would be a
   rational that we as a society have already dismissed by letting people
   get married after child bearing age, letting male-male marriages exist,
   or surrogacy for any married couple.

   As far as the governments interests in the various problems you
   mentioned, we already attempt to adjudicate them by law in a variety of
   other complex cases (80 year old millionaire's with 26 year wives and
   children for example). It is illegal and unconstitutional to decline to
   answer legitimate problems simply because it's hard. The
   unconstitutionality becomes all the more relevant as we delve into
   these areas for some groups but not others.

   Marring entities that do not have the legal right to consent is of
   course a complete non-starter on it's face until the status of an
   entities right to consent comes under constitutional scrutiny.

   Without an amendment to the Constitution non-human animals are not
   considered to have legal rights that they may invoke themselves and no
   entity has the authority to consent for them. Bluntly a Pet is a pet
   and not a person with the rights of persons under the Constitution.
   There exists in this understanding a lot of potential problems
   concerning possible eventual sentient beings such as AI, Genetically
   Engineered or Heavily Altered humanoid entities, etc.

   The legal rights of minors to consent are currently hodgepodge and
   patch work across the United States. To my knowledge there is a minimum
   floor of 12 years of age for marriage with parental consent and 14
   without parental consent. There are of course states that higher
   standards and many states do not allow a minor to marry until the age
   of 18 with or without parental consent when people in the US attain
   Primary Majority. There are laws however that universally do not
   deliver majority to persons in the U.S. until age 21. The various ages
   change but there is a fundamental principle in play that before a
   certain age even sentient persons can not consent to sex let alone
   marriage. The primary discussion revolves around where that line lays.

   I'm curious to see what happens with yesterday's decision. They
   basically punted it back to our Krazy Kongress. Pretty ludicrous. But
   at the same time - given the optics the Republican Party (the so-called
   "normal" part of it, such as it is) is trying so desperately to change,
   I wonder if the allegedly sane Republicans will band together with
   Democrats and get something done for the sole purpose of political
   expedience. If they don't, watch out in 2014. It could hand Democrats
   an advantage they hadn't otherwise anticipated.
