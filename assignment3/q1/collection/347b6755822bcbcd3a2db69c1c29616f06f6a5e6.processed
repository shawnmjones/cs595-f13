[23]Presenting your 2013 GOP March To Madness Crazy Eight

   After more than 150,000 votes in the 2013 Daily Kos Republican March to
   Madness Tournament--and more wingnuttery than is safe for human
   consumption--we now have a Crazy Eight. And it will be from these eight
   loons that a champion wingnut will be picked.

   Here's a look at the bracket (click on it to enlarge):

   [30]2013 Daily Kos Republican March to Madness Tournament Crazy Eight
   Click to enlarge

   Yet again, what a testament to the incredible depth of this year's
   field: we've got two #1 seeds (Rush Limbaugh and Rick Santorum), but
   we've also got a #15 seed (Ann Coulter) and two #10 seeds (Pat Roberts
   and Wayne LaPierre).

   LaPierre in particular is evidence of the GOP's outstanding depth
   chart: He never would have made it this far just a few months ago, but
   his nutty reaction to the push for sensible gun control has vaulted him
   into an elite field. He was literally just waiting for his moment--and
   he seized it, with reckless disregard for anything but pure nutjobbery.
   That's what it takes to win this thing, and he's got his work cut out
   for him: His opponent will be #4 seed Dick Cheney.

   Rounding out the Crazy Eight are Michele Bachmann and Steve King who
   will face off in an epic battle of teabaggers. The winner of the whole
   tournament easily might come down to that one matchup. It will be
   amazing.

   We'll get things underway this afternoon with Limbaugh vs. Coulter
   followed by Santorum vs. Robertson. Tomorrow will be the Bachmann vs.
   King and Cheney vs. LaPierre matchups. You'll have until Monday morning
   at 8:30 AM ET to vote after which we'll announce our Freakshow Four.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [43]Tagging tips - [44]Search For Tags - [45]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [46]Civil
   Rights, [47]Community, [48]Congress, [49]Culture, [50]Economy,
   [51]Education, [52]Elections, [53]Energy, [54]Environment, [55]Health
   Care, [56]International, [57]Labor, [58]Law, [59]Media, [60]Meta,
   [61]National Security, [62]Science, [63]Transportation, or [64]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([65]California, [66]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       . . .of the mythical creature, Cerberus, who guarded the gates of
       Hades.  He beats all of the other entrants, because he is so close
       to pure evil.  He has stolen reality, democracy, human rights, the
       reputation of the United States, a good portion of the treasury,
       the brain of George Bush,the title most of paranoid American to
       ever live, and the living heart of a real human being.
       The dictionary has Cheney's image next to the word evil. As bad as
       others were, God only knows what would have happened had he been a
       politician in Germany during the thirties.
       Cheney has to be the hands down champion in any competition

   Questionable seeding, but I cannot really complain about the choices,
   except for Ann Coulter.  She's a has-been with almost no media

       On the crazy meter, Ann Coulter is unmatched.  The fact that she
       puts a new book out every now and then - and the media promote the

       she lacks credibility.  Lacking credibility is NOT a handicap for

   Not one of tomorrow's leading whackjobs made the cut: Cruz, Paul,

       On paper, he would appear to be the brightest of the next gen. Not

   all the teabaggers live in that alternate reality and depend on rush

   they need that daily smorgasbord of prechewed talking points to nourish

   instead of ignoring it the teabaggers will disappear back into the used

   Is between those who are totally f*cking whack, and those whose
   inherent whackness has been magnified in our minds by their high
   positions.  Personally, I think Coulter and Robertson are the the most
   purely psychotic,  that Limbaugh and Cheney are just a hair less so,
   being of a more calculatedly evil persuasion, but that the latter two
   should advance simply because they're responsible for more charred

 King v Bachman ([382]0+ / 0-)

   Interesting matchup of Iowa natives.  We don't usually think of this
   much craziness coming from the Hawkeye state, but there you have it.
   Michelle Bachman proved herself on the national stage during the
   presidential primary season.  And she has the added advantage of a
   campaign finance scandal brewing.

   But who can best Steve King?  Standing up for dog fighting, proposing a
   Berlin-style wall and standing on the House floor with a model of how
   it would be built between the USA and Mexico?  Of course the wall/fence
   model was years ago, but memory does not fade.  And other tea-bagger
   pronouncements too numerous to mention.

   If King were to make a senate run, he might have the edge, but for this
   season, I will have to go for Michelle Bachman due to her national
   reputation and recognition.

 King is friendly and pleasant in person ([400]0+ / 0-)
       one-on-one. He doesn't seem hostile. It just that he continually
       says goofy things. He had the extreme Tea party philosophy before
       the Tea party existed. His first years in congress, he was part of
       a small, fringe minority in the minority party in the House. It was
       easy to just laugh him off then. Now he's part of the dominant wing
       of the House Republican caucus, giving John Boehner fits and making
       governing impossible.
       King is anti-science, anti-government, anti-animal rights,
       anti-immigration reform, anti-marriage equality or LGBT rights,
       anti-woman, anti-abortion, anti-Obamacare, anti-CFL bulbs,
       anti-conservation (energy or anything else), anti-environmental

   on their way out the door, with little to no influence on the future of

   house rep now.  Serial loser Santorum? We love to make fun of his
   crazy, but a real threat? As for Robertson and Cheney, aren't they dead
   yet?

   La Pierre vs. Ryan was a tough one.  Really La Pierre shouldn't have
   been an 8th seed.  Should have been much higher.

   As for the vanquished, the really dangerous crazy GOPers were Paul,
   Cruz, and Rubio . . . you know, the future of the GOP.  Jindal is part
   of the future of the GOP, but at least his milquetoast personality
   explains his loss.  Ultimately, they were all usurped by GOPers that
   are comfortable and known commodities, but no longer a real threat
   kinda crazy.
