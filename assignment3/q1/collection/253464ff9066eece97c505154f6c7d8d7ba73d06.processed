   Boston Marathon bomb suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev
   Boston Marathon bomb suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev
   With the successful capture of the second Boston Marathon bombing
   suspect, Dzhokar Tsarnaev, the focus turns to the postmortem of the
   capture, the why and how of the attacks, and, of course, the
   exploitation of the attack by Republicans who want to reignite the
   Bush/Cheney war on terror and war on civil liberties.

   The Boston Globe has a [29]detailed profile of the brothers Tsarnaev,
   suggesting as many reports have that the younger brother was heavily
   influenced by a strong-willed and increasingly extremist brother.

   For the details of the capture, this [30]detailed timeline from the
   Washington Post fits the bill. One jarring note, particularly after the
   failure of new gun safety measures in the Senate this week:

     Finally discovered, the Tsarnaevs led police on a chase through
     residential streets, hurling grenades and makeshift bombs as they
     drove. When cornered, they battled police with guns and more
     homemade explosives, wounding a transit officer and trading more
     than 200 rounds until the officers ran out of ammunition.

   The two had apparently amassed more firepower than the police had at
   hand. But instead of talking about gun regulations now, some
   Republicans (Chuck Grassley is [31]taking the lead) want to use this to
   derail immigration reform. Others, led by the usual suspects Sens.
   Lindsey Graham and John McCain, of course want to strip Tsarnaev of his
   civil liberties and try him as a military detainee and [32]sent to
   Guantanamo. Because you certainly don't want to wait until an
   investigation reveals the motives of the suspect, and whether or not he
   had any ties to any actual terrorist organization. Here are [33]four
   good reasons not to: 1) he might not be an enemy combatant, just a
   killer with a bomb; 2) he is a naturalized U.S. citizen; 3) he was
   captured in the U.S., which poses as many legal challenges as trying a
   citizen as an enemy combatant; and 4) there's no reason to believe a
   military detention would gain any prosecutorial advantage.

   The administration has invoked a public-safety exemption to delay
   reading Tsarnaev his Miranda rights. The public-safety exemption is
   intended to give law enforcement the opportunity to determine if there
   are any imminent threats still posed: unexploded IEDs that might be
   planted around the city, co-conspirators still at large, etc. What the
   exemption means for Tsarnaev is that anything he says to investigators
   during this exemption period [DEL: will :DEL] could nonetheless be
   admissible in court. Which is why the public-safety exemption should
   be, as the ACLU's [34]Anthony Romero told the New York Times' Charlie
   Savage, "a narrow and limited one, and it would be wholly inappropriate
   and unconstitutional to use it to create the case against the suspect."

   A primary concern with any statements he might make in the next days is
   what kind of medical condition he is in, whether statements might be
   made while he's under the influence of sedation and/or painkillers, and
   if those statements end up being used in his prosecution. Marcy Wheeler
   [35]explores those issues, as well as the question of whether the
   administration will follow the intent of the limited public-safety
   exemption, or extend for weeks the period in which Tsarnaev is denied
   counsel.

   [36]11:43 AM PT: And, of course, there's this from a New York state
   senator. Yes, he's a Republican.

   wouldn't use torture on this punk to save more lives?

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Which reflect my mixed feelings about the Miranda denial

   1 - The kid is likely smart enough to know he doesn't need to talk
    2 - how are they going to force him to talk? he's not in Gitmo
    3 - he will be talking to a lawyer, so if they brutalize him, he can
   reveal this
    4 - might they bring in his uncle or some of the victims or the father
   of the child killed to shame him into talking?
    5 - none of this jeopardizes a conviction - they have plenty on him
   without his admitting guilt
    6 - but if his defence is in part he didn't know what he was doing -
   not part of the bomb building, then was in a panic after, afraid for
   his life when his picture shown - this could be ended by his talking
   (this is where having a lawyer could help him, at least in avoiding the
   death penalty)
    7 - couldn't the US att'y pressure him to tell what he knows in
   exchange for no death penalty? (risky in terms of public opinion - but
   remember, Terry Nichols got a life term and the public accepted it for
   a much worse toll)

   On the whole, unless they have strong evidence of no one else involved
   (who now could flee the country) or that no other bombs have been
   planted, I get the imminent threat part. But the whole thing is
   borderline, and I agree that if Obama weren't president, a lot of us
   might look at this differently.

   That said, doing this likely immunizes  Justice Dept in part for going
   ahead with a civil trial and is the political course of least
   resistance.

       Actually, if those were the facts they would almost surely believe
       that liberals did it as a set up to take their guns, just as they
       think happened with Sandy Hook.

 there is one thing ([230]0+ / 0-)
       It seems to me that the Justice Department will be considering
       whether it can, or should, try him in federal court.
       The section that I noted (and I might have missed many others) is
       s. 2332a, the one about weapons of mass destruction. That term is
       defined to include bombs.
       Something federal-level has to be involved, of course, for them to
       have federal jurisdiction. One clause refers to harming interstate
       commerce. Another refers to interstate or foreign travel.
       Tsarnaev's brother did the foreign travel, but it is a criminal
       conspiracy, so it attaches to Tsarnaev, too.
       The maximum penalty: death penalty, if death resulted from the use
       of the weapon of mass destruction.
       I can see how the Justice Department might fit the Boston Marathon
       into interstate commerce, with its tens of thousands of
       runners--many from outside the state--and more tens of thousands of
       out-of-state visitors. The state government will have all the stats
       on how much money the visitors spend.
       Would the right wing be happy if he is tried, convicted, and
       sentenced to death?
       I'm thinking...probably yes, even if he isn't tortured first.

 It's an interesting question, because ([234]0+ / 0-)

   there is a huge difference between a public safety exception that seeks
   at once to locate dangerous this and that, and what a judge will or
   will not allow to be used at a subsequent trial, when whatever  public
   safety risk forms a part of the case against this adolescent or
   thoughts of public safety in the moment have abated.
    As those of us who have sort of followed the truly appalling Jodie
   Arias are only too aware thanks to HLN, a trial judge has huge amounts
   of control in keeping evidence from going before a jury, and most are
   only too prepared to work through whether the police used the public
   safety exception for limited public safety purposes, or went wider and
   are trying to use otherwise inadmissible stuff, assuming the defense
   raises the issue.

   as a lawyer who basically only had one major criminal case and it was
   environmental:

   Nothing will be deemed admissible if the subject is under the influence
   of drugs or otherwise incapacitated.  That's why the question about
   capacity is asked during something less intrusive like a deposition.

   The exception to Miranda is a 48 hour window and the burden is on the
   "prosecution" to demonstrate that there is an fear of imminent harm to
   the public and/or LE.

   He should be tried in the U.S. -- the only question is whether it
   should be in MA state or federal court.  I believe that some kind of
   evidentiary hearing is required under due process to determine the
   motiviation which would trigger whether or not the crimes were
   terrorism (pertaining to a political motive) or just some fucked up
   idea.

   Lindsey Graham should lose his law license.  He's a menace to the

   It's not true that anything he says without being Mirandized under the
   "public safety" exception can be used against him. If a judge later
   determines that the "public safety" exception ceased being applicable
   at some point before he was Mirandized, his answers to questions would
   NOT be admissible. Of course, in this climate, it would be an unusually
   brave judge to hold that the exception didn't apply. Which is why it's
   so dangerous for the Executive to invoke it.

     The Tsarnaev family had been battered by history before--by empire
     and the strife of displacement, by exile and emigration. Asylum in a
     bright new land proved little comfort. When Anzor fell sick, a few
     years ago, he resolved to return to the Caucasus; he could not
     imagine dying in America. He had travelled halfway around the world
     from the harrowed land of his ancestors, but something had drawn him
     back. The American dream wasn't for everyone. What they could not
     anticipate was the abysmal fate of their sons, lives destroyed in a
     terror of their own making. The digital era allows no asylum from
     extremism, let alone from the toxic combination of high-minded
     zealotry and the curdled disappointments of young men. A decade in
     America already, I want out.

   that Republicans cried, "Now is not the time to make an emotional
   decision!" when 20 children were murdered by a long gunman spraying
   bullets in a CT classroom.  "Don't punish law abiding citizens for the
   actions of one nut!"

   But they're planning to make very emotional decisions about millions of
   law abiding (other than the obvious overstaying the immigration visa or
   border jumping violation) immigrants, based on the actions of 2 (or
   possibly a few more) whack job immigrants.

   And I am not saying perhaps better screening of immigrants from, say,
   Chechnya or Syria or Iraq or Yemen is a bad idea. Some people probably
   just want to get out of those hellholes; some probably want to do great
   harm to the USA. But why is it that no Republicans are troubled that
   the cops ran out of ammo long before the bad guys did?  No one is
   troubled that two young men had grenades and assault rifles and enough
   ammunition to wreak some serious havoc, to hold off an army of cops,
   and to paralyze an entire city for a couple of days.  And I'll bet it
   was all bought legally.

       I'm not talking about cops walking a normal beat on a sunny Boston

       And FYI, destructive grenades--frags, incendiaries, white
       phosphorus--are perfectly legal in America.  To get one you need to
       file a form, get approval from the sheriff--all of whom apparently
       oppose gun control so it's hard to imagine they'd be for grenade
       control-- get fingerprinted, go through a background check and pay
       a $200 tax for every grenade you want.

   need for this whole mess to be much worse than it is. They need to
   anticipate how much worse it could have been.

   They will not see (as several diarists have noted) that the situation
   unfolded the way it did because everything worked the way it should and
   ordinary people did extraordinary things to help the process.

   Torturing Dzhokhar Tsarnaev gets us no where. Making him the center of
   evil, the target of all the anger grief doesn't help. That doesn't mean
   he shouldn't pay for his actions.

   Understanding his actions is important to how we address public safety.
   Getting as much information from him as possible moves us further. Fear
   is born out of ignorance; knowledge sets you free.

   The bombers could be two screwed up kids. Or not. The truth will help
   most of us move past the Boston bombing and get on with our lives -
   help us celebrate the acts of being humans at our best.

   But the right wing will never buy any answers that don't lead to the

       However it seems that sometimes police are not very well trained in
       firearm usage. Perhaps the assumption is that police will attempt
       to make good use of every round (to minimize collateral damage if
       nothing else) and they are "stocked" with ammo on an incorrect
       assumption?
       Sometimes, [868]like in Torrance a couple months ago, perhaps the

       I'm still trying to figure out, with NO returning fire, what the
       cops were shooting at in the Torrance case - all of them and their
       supervisors, all the way up the line, should be fired. The rest of
       the officers in the organization should undergo extensive
       retraining.
       Maybe every police officer should only be allowed to carry ten
       rounds until they have met some uniform federal firearm training
       standards.

       I think the owner of the car could be asked to testify to what they
       told him. Whether that is considered hearsay, I am not sure. There
       are a lot of exceptions to hearsay.
       I'm thinking if 3 says he heard from someone else that 1 and 2 said
       they did it, it is different from if 3 says he directly heard from
       1 and 2 that they did it. Since he heard it directly, it may be
       admissible. Also, he could testify that they said it, but not
       necessarily that it is true, because he doesn't know if it is true,
       just that they said it.

       This is how debased our discourse has become. Of course this should
       be a political issue in the real meaning of the phrase - something
       that our elected representatives should debate and study as they
       enact policies, with different sides debating this issue and then
       coming to a consensus.
       Politics, because of the Repubs, now has become tribal - our side
       vs your side, with no openmindedness but rather than being all
       agenda all the time. That's not true politics - it's a perversion
       of politics.
       The Dems after 9/11 failed the country by not politicizing the
       attack - why did Bush ignore the August warnings, why had they back
       away from interest in Bin Ladin despite strong warnings from
       outgoing Clinton officials, why did they assume an Iraqi

       In a responsible democracy, citizens, including the press, have an
       obligation to discuss the impact of major events as to what their
       meaning is and to what potential policy issues this raises.
       Unfortunately, our public dialogue has gone out of control. But
       that doesn't mean discussion should be suppressed.
       Let's go back to 9/11 - Bush/Cheney and their cohorts quickly
       hijacked the discussion, and more importantly were making plans out
       of public view. According to what I understand your POV is, Dems
       were right to be 100% supportive and not raise key issues about the
       government's performance and what actions should be taken because
       it would have politicized things.
       And as to the specific crime and the response - of course it's
       valid to discuss whether the shelter-in-place plan was appropriate,
       whether releasing the pictures (which remember led to the death of
       the policeman) was the right procedure, how the suspect should be
       tried - all these things are reasonable topics for public debate
       and discussion. It's not per se politicizing things, it's part of
       being an open democracy.

   but I think the reason Dems did not 'politicize' 9/11 is that the event
   had acquired quasi-sacred status in the culture, a secular religion if
   you will, complete with iconography, rituals and what-not. (Not a
   cultural anthropologist, more my wife's baliwick.)

   FWIW, the Dems failed the country when they failed to call the working

   If anyone is wondering why the right wing and certain elements on the
   press were so quick to jump on President Obama for not immediately
   labeling what happened in Boston an ACT OF TERROR!!!!!!, the answer is
   simple.

   Calling anything an act of terror automatically strips the accused of
   all rights, allows the Constitution to be disregarded, and eliminates
   any restrictions on what "law enforcement" (now there's an oxymoron in
   the age of FOX NEWS) can do to anyone remotely connected with the ACT
   OF TERROR.

   Authoritarians have got this down to a reflex. It's the perfect excuse

     Federal investigators are hurrying to review a visit that one of the

     Muslim republics in the north Caucasus region of Russia. Both have
     active militant separatist movements. There are concerns in Congress

   If the authorities follow the law, he can't be denied counsel. Not

       Marcy:

     But the big issue, in my opinion, is presentment, whether he is
     brought before a judge within 48 hours. In addition to stretching
     Miranda, the government has also been holding and interrogating
     suspects for periods -- up to two weeks for American citizens and
     far longer for non-citizens -- before they see a judge. Not only
     does this postpone the time when they will be given a lawyer whether
     they ask or not (because judges are going to assign one), but it
     gives the government an uninterrupted period of time to use soft
     coercion to get testimony and other kinds of cooperation.

   a clue who committed the Anthrax attacks. On the other hand, the 3
   major terror acts that occurred during Democratic administrations (WTC
   93, OKC, and the Boston bombings) all saw the planners and perpetrators
   all captured quickly. The planners of all 3 events are dead. One was
   sentenced to death, one died in jail, and the other was killed by
   police. Would they be 'deader' if they had been tried in a military
   court? Oh, and let's not forget the the Obama administration killed
   Osama Bin Laden. If you were keeping score that would actually bring
   the Republican total to minus 1. When a Republican administration
   actually apprehends someone who was involved in a major terror attack,
   they can decide how and where they'll be tried. Until then they should

   the US in the Islamic world with the policy. Having said that, the
   majority of the public is with Obama on his counter-terrorism policies.
   With this credibility I don't think he is vulnerable to attacks from
   the right (he is coddling the suspect, he has let  up on the war on

   If indeed it was Russian - could it be that the older brother had

   authorities had any information/concerns about him before granting it?

   It makes no sense that Russia would grant a six month visa to a Chechen
   they had info on and passed on to the US right after their request,
   unless they just wanted to double check before granting it, or (quite
   unlikely) had some plot to use a double agent to recruit him as a
   Chechen terrorist on US soil in order to do something bad that would
   alientate the US from the Chechens.

   And it is possible that after he returned HS checked with Russia to see
   if they had further info, and they said no.

   If no info initially was passed on, but rather, it was in the context
   of checking for visa approval. the FBI is likely off the hook for this.

 Well my problem with some of this ([1353]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1354]blukat, [1355]Ricochet67, [1356]worldlotus

   is that the dead brother was under an asylum protected status.The live
   brother is a citizen. And so is entitled to a few rights. Trying not to
   sound like a RWConspiracy nut here but:
   1. Presumed Innocence? - Suspects do not = Convicts.
   I have not seen the supposed video of Dhzokar Tsarnaev setting down the
   bag and watching it go boom yet, have you? All we have seen is that
   they were there carrying backpacks like a few thousand other people.
   2. The "Stay Safe" Tweet - is being repeated in the press like they
   don't know how to tell time. I have heard newsguy say it was Tsarnaev
   the Younger crowing about their bombing success. Not sure how he can
   interpret it like that since it was sent about 15 hours BEFORE the
   bombing.
   3. So how is it that we just stood by and watched a massive warrantless
   search into many many homes? What happened to anyone who refused to let
   the cops in? Did we hear about those or is everybody that lives within
   a 15 mile radius of Boston an angel other than these 2 Tsarnaevs?
   4. Why isn't the media saying "Let's see the incriminating video now?"
   - one dead and one may not make it - why not? The people need to see
   that. The state is prosecuting on behalf of the PEOPLE - so let us see
   that! see #1 above.
   5. How much did this all cost - this grand exercise of near-martial law
   without all the legal fuss? I know the drug dealers (name-your-drug
   here) lost money and product. Somebody should check the drainage before
   all the cocaine/pot/etc kills all the fish around there from being
   flushed before the giant house-to-house search.

   6. The Public Safety Exception to the Miranda rights - only is for the
   question " Is there more of you, more bombs, anything else to worry
   about?" - Because all the cops (name-your-agency here) said - that's
   it, nothing more to worry about, yet want to invoke the public safety
   exception. Are we safe or not? Because after those questions are
   answered, then he should be Mirandized, per the rules.

   7. Facts and REAL timelines - Was the 7-11 robbed or not? Apparently
   not. If not, why was Ofc Sean Collier killed? In his car no less. Where
   is the CNN/FOX/NBC interview of the car-jacking victim? They've
   interviewed the rest of Boston but not this guy? I'd like to see that
   video of the ATM withdrawal too.

   8. How is it they were carrying around all that
   ammo/guns/ieds/bombs/etc to have it conveniently show up in the
   Mercedes they "hi-jacked"? The still from the 7-11 video shows a
   smiling, relaxed Dhzokar approaching the counter, not a heavily-laden
   'terrist' robbing the joint.

   9. FSB let FBI know about this older brother in 2009 and FBI admitted
   to talking to the guy in 2011 (around the time Tam's friend was killed
   in an unsolved triple homocide along with 2 other college students in
   Waltham in Sept 2011). Why is that being given a pass?

   10. I personally think that Tsarnaev the Younger -was not part of the
   plot, but duped by his brother. His response after that, was almost,
   almost normal. His actions post-bombing were pretty normal, like maybe
   he didn't know he had carried a bomb to the marathon, and his brother
   just had him pack his stuff with him.
   ---I know my opinion is just that, my opinion.

   When we remember we are all mad, the mysteries disappear and life
   stands explained.-Mark Twain

   There are so many ugly Americans voicing their inner Rambo these past
   few days. Each one trying to one up the last. This is what human beings
   do. Or at least those that forget they are supposed to be civilized.

   What they forget is that what they are doing is exactly what outside
   groups like Al Qaeda have been trying to do all along. Make us become
   scared enough to rewrite our laws, ignore those basic laws we all
   treasure and prove once and for all that we are not civilized to the
   rest of the world. They won when we passed the Patriot Act, the won
   again when they created Guantanamo. And now they appear to be winning
   again as we gang up on a single surviving bomber with threats to
   torture, ignore that he is a naturalized citizen and send him to
   Guantanamo.

   We are doing this to ourselves and we are losing what's most important.

   Nope not the Boston marathon bombing and the follow on murders but the
   near destruction of an entire town in Texas.  It was laissez faire
   terrorism - the one that kills Americans every hour of the day
   throughout the land due to uncontrolled weapons, bad planning
   decisions, lax government oversight and simply greed.

 Easy to convict--secret rendition not required ([1380]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1381]blukat, [1382]pistolSO, [1383]worldlotus

   If you have nothing to charge a person with, or get a conviction with,
   then you might think the only thing you can do is spirit the person
   away, throw him into a secret prison, and torture him just in case he
   screams something you can use to re-assure yourself that you were in
   the right.

   This guy?

   There is a mountain of evidence against Tsarnaev.

   The prosecutors assigned to his case will be first rate--not the newest
   recruits on the block.

   But even the newest recruits could probably get a conviction.

   He and his brother were part of a criminal conspiracy. Everything
   they've got on his brother can be used against him, along with
   everything they've got on him.

   They won't need to enter a single word he says during questioning in
   order to secure a conviction, either.

 That's what upsets the neocons ([1386]0+ / 0-)
       All of this is based on the rather obvious fact that this is
       domestic terrorism.  Most domestic terrorism (and all of the really
       virulent strains) comes from right wing religious fundamentalists.
        They have a lot of support in the law enforcement community (the
       FBI is full of admitted Christian fundamentalists, and is
       hopelessly corrupt).
       There are two different world views at work in the United States,
       folks, and Lindsay Graham and the rest of them are on the
       confederate side.  In the eyes of most conservatives, this isn't a
       matter of criminal law, but a moral statement (they don't like New
       England, they don't really like public sporting events, especially
       the kind for which pretty much anyone can register, and they regard
       the urban liberal population you find in metro Boston as immoral in
       the eyes of God.  Thus, when a couple of terrorist scumbags bomb
       and shoots the place up, it isn't a bunch of criminals who need to
       be taken down and locked up, but a morality tale.

   Maybe this buy will be sent to Guantanamo Bay?  He's part of a

 We've read enough to know ([1393]0+ / 0-)

   that he is an Islamic Jihadist, therefore an enemy combatant.  Miranda
   rights are not warranted.
    I'm afraid there might be hundreds of  individuals here in the US just
   like him and his brother, planning similar attacks.  Dzhokar Tsarnaev
   could provide info that might thwart those attacks.

   by [1394]Jo Bob on [1395]Sat Apr 20, 2013 at 02:50:25 PM PDT



 Wonderful ([1396]0+ / 0-)

   This whole business about not reading him his rights is bullshit.  They
   have enough on him to send him up for life; in the Federal case, they
   have enough to execute him.  And unlike Timothy McVeigh, he won't have
   the full weight of the right wing legal establishment defending him.
   (And if he's part of some broader conspiracy, which is unlikely, that
   death penalty threat can be used to get him to reveal it.)

   The first question is why this isn't treated as domestic terrorism?
   The older brother's rantings could, if you substitute "Jesus" for
   "Allah", be from any group of social conservatives in America.  The
   guns and explosives were procured domestically, even though the older
   brother had an outstanding domestic violence conviction, which should
   have automatically disqualified him from possessing firearms or the
   sorts of gunpowder and smokeless powder that reloaders are allowed to
   buy.  At the end of the day, where's the foreign connection?  How do we
   know this wasn't connected to domestic right wingers?  Other than the
   older brother's social media postings containing "Allah" and "Muslim",
   this whole event follows closely the scenario for domestic terrorism --
   and because the perps are Caucasian, they are likely to receive such
   support.

   In the meantime, Lindsay Graham, whose own loyalty to the United States
   is highly suspect in my mind (his religious fundamentalism, his support
   for Confederate ideology, his support for right wing domestic
   terrorism, his racism) has no business commenting on any of this.
