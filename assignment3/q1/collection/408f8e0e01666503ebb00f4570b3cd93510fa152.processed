The Smart Legislative Strategy for Obama's Second Term

   The Smart Legislative Strategy for Obama's Second Term

   [29]Human Events
   December 5, 2012
   Newt Gingrich

   Instead of being focused on a phony fiscal cliff, Republicans might
   focus on how they will approach Obama's second term.

   What should House Republicans do? They are in a very different world
   than they expected just one month ago. Instead of cooperating with a
   new President-elect Romney, they find themselves baited, taunted, and
   attacked by a newly re-elected and re-energized President Obama.

   What is the right strategy for this new situation?

   The news media are, of course, in full collusion with the president in
   defining the current situation in pro-liberal, anti-Republican terms.

   The House Republican situation is made even more complex by the
   strengthened position of Democrats in the Senate. Majority Leader Harry
   Reid (D-Nev.) has to feel emboldened by the strategic success of
   gaining seats in a year which began with every expectation of
   substantial Republican Senate gains.

   The news media and Washington elite solution is simple: surrender, cave
   in, give up your principles, do what the President demands. Those are
   the daily suggestions and expectations of the elite media and much if
   the national establishment, which takes its talking points from the
   consensus media of the left.

   It would be a triple disaster for House Republicans to follow this
   defeatist advice.

   First, it would be a betrayal of the very principles for which they
   campaigned and the voters who elected them.

   Second, it would deeply and bitterly split the House Republican
   Conference between hard core conservatives and "Obama cooperators."

   Third, it would embolden President Obama and the left to increase their
   demands and push for even more concessions.

   House Republicans are guaranteed majority status through 2014. The odds
   are overwhelming that they will increase rather than decrease their
   numbers in the 2014.

   Election

   House Republicans do not have to worry about day-to-day headlines or
   day-to-day polls.

   They have the opportunity to think and to develop a new strategy in
   response to their new circumstance.

   It was this understanding of time and strategic patterns which enabled
   the first House Republican majority in 40 years to become, in 1996, the
   first re-elected House Republican majority in 68 years.

   The Washington establishment mythology of the Clinton years almost
   completely falsifies what actually happened.

   House Republicans closed the government twice in late 1995 in their
   determination to convince President Clinton and the national
   establishment that we were going to balance the federal budget for the
   first time in a generation.

   The Washington media still believe this was a major mistake.

   Yet closing the government convinced the Republican base and the
   conservative movement that we were serious and had the courage to stand
   and fight for our convictions.

   One year later House Republicans were re-elected despite a resounding
   defeat for Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole. Almost no one
   in the national establishment has ever looked at the GOP's House
   victory and why it occurred.

   Welfare reform and the only four balanced budgets in the modern era
   were a direct result of that strategy. Furthermore, those balanced
   budgets were produced by economic growth brought about by tax cuts, not
   by a socialist austerity program based on tax increases.

   House Republicans should take the next six weeks to meet in private and
   work through a grand strategy for the next four years.

   They have to develop a strategic program that can stop and then reverse
   the efforts of President Obama and the left to fundamentally change
   America.

   This is precisely the type of moment the Founding Fathers designed the
   constitutional balance for.

   The Founding Fathers understood that the executive branch could
   potentially become dictatorial and too powerful. That is why they built
   in checks and balances.

   The House has five great tools for offsetting a President. These tools
   are helped by a cooperative Senate but they are not eliminated by an
   uncooperative Senate.

   The five tools are:

   1. Appropriations

   2. Oversight

   3. Legislation

   4. Communications

   5. Negotiations

   The House Republicans today are over-relying on negotiations, the fifth
   and least useful of the five tools. Our effective negotiations with
   President Clinton only came after the two government shutdowns. We had
   to earn his respect through direct, hard confrontation before we could
   get his attention for practical negotiations.

   The negotiation tool is the weakest because it centralizes
   communications and decision making into a formula which maximizes the
   President's dominance within the national news media.

   Appropriations

   The most powerful House tool is appropriations. This power goes all the
   way back to Runnymede and the signing of the Magna Carta. If the
   people's representatives don't appropriate the money, the President
   can't spend it. House Republicans should be prepared to suspend all
   appropriations except national security and public safety. They should
   selectively zero out the least popular of the President's initiatives
   and agencies. He can attack the House all he wants, but he can't spend
   money without its approval. The conservative movement would be
   galvanized by such a display of firmness.

   Oversight

   There are well over a hundred subcommittees which can be holding
   oversight hearings. Like the Lilliputians tying down Gulliver, these
   subcommittees can gradually educate the country about the waste, the
   cronyism, the corruption, and the radicalism existing throughout the
   Obama executive branch. The daily reports of hearing after hearing and
   scandal after scandal become a Fabian strategy of wearing down the
   Obama juggernaut and exposing its downside.

   There is also a positive side to the hearing and oversight process. The
   House Republicans should ally with the 30 Republican Governors. Many of
   them are doing very smart things which could be applied to Washington.
   All of them can highlight areas in which Washington is forcing waste
   and inefficiency on their state. They give the House Republicans 30
   star witnesses to layoff hearings. Several former Governors (notably
   Indiana's Mitch Daniels and Mississippi's Haley Barbour) would also
   make outstanding witnesses.

   The combination of positive reform ideas and negative coverage of waste
   and scandal could make every subcommittee a star in its own right and
   create more communications than the White House could cope with.

   Legislation

   Legislation is action. It is fact. It is reality.

   House Republicans should start by scouring the bills introduced by
   House and Senate Democrats for every good idea. Every chance House
   Republicans have to pass a bill introduced by a House or Senate
   Democrat, they build an irrefutable record of bipartisanship. Let Harry
   Reid and President Obama explain why they oppose Democratic bills
   passed by the House Republicans.

   In addition, House Republicans should look for specific, narrowly-drawn
   positive ideas and pass a vast series of small bills. Let the
   Democratic Senate either start behaving responsibly or let it become
   known as the graveyard of obstruction. Either a lot of bills will be
   sent to the President or the theme of Constructive Republican House
   versus an obstructionist Democrat Senate will become a major factor in
   the 2014 elections.

   Communications

   House Republicans should study the period 1824-1828. The Jacksonians
   were enraged by the outcome of the election of 1824 and they spent four
   years steadily undermining the administration of President John Quincy
   Adams. Their use of the frank and of Congressional communications is a
   masterpiece.

   In 1996, a concerted, methodical House Republican effort enabled us to
   reform Medicare and win the communications argument. In 2012, the
   National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee did a splendid job
   of defeating Mediscare.

   The House Republican leaders cannot out-communicate the President. It
   is a structural impossibility because of the White House command of
   communications.

   However, 200-plus House Republicans (some will never cooperate) can
   more than overmatch an Executive Branch.

   Negotiations

   Having used appropriations to prove seriousness, oversight to define
   the debate, legislation to build a coalition, and communications to
   define the contest, then House Republicans can then negotiate from
   strength.

   This is a strategy which can set the star for a successful 2014 and
   2016.

   More importantly, this is the right strategy for our values and for
   America.
