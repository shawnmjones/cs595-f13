Obama talks about how Washington changes

   President Obama appeared on Univision today, and Jorge Ramos asked what
   the president considers his greatest failure since taking office.
   Republicans and some political reporters seem pretty excited about the
   answer, but I'm at a loss to explain why they're worked up.

   IFRAME: [3]http://www.youtube.com/embed/kEuDqBFuFK4

   [4]Watch on YouTube

   For those who can't watch clips online, Obama initially mentioned his
   disappointment on not having passed comprehensive immigration reform,
   but then spoke to a larger concern.

     "The most important lesson I've learned is that you can't change
     Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the
     outside."

   Ben Smith argued this might be the biggest "[5]gaffe" of Obama's
   presidency. Zeke Miller [6]said the comment "seemed to undercut a
   central premise of his 2008 election." Indeed, the YouTube clip
   included above was posted by the Republican National Committee's
   rapid-response team, as if the excerpt -- in which Obama clearly talks
   about the importance of Republican obstructionism in explaining what
   ails the political process -- was self-evidently embarrassing for the
   president.

   I can usually understand when some random comment gets Republicans and
   political reporters riled up, but this one's even thinner than most.
   The president, right or wrong, believes that real political change is
   dependent on outside-the-Beltway activism, pressuring policymakers to
   do the right thing -- the whole notion of politics from the grassroots
   up. That's not a "gaffe"; it's not even new -- Obama has said this
   repeatedly, before and after his election.

   One can argue about whether this assessment is accurate, but to
   consider it controversial seems pretty strange, even by the standards
   of the 2012 race.

   It's a strained interpretation, but I suppose the reporter/Republican
   argument would be, "Obama made it sound as if there's no point in
   voting for him, since 'you can't change Washington from the inside.'"
   But that's silly -- Obama believes he can't change Washington, or major
   national policy, or the nation's direction by himself, and he's right.
   It's a cooperative process, dependent on engaged citizens and more than
   one branch of government.

   I guess some are getting tired of the "47 percent" story, but to make a
   fuss over this is to try too hard to change the subject.

   Update: As part of his answer, which the RNC left out of the video,
   Obama talked about doing more in a second term to engaged in "more of a
   conversation with the American people so they can move these issues
   forward." This context makes the so-called "gaffe" even less
   controversial and more mundane.

   Here's a transcript of Obama's next sentences, not shown in the clip:
   "That's how I got elected, and that's how the big accomplishments like
   health care got done, was because we mobilized the American people to
   speak out. That's how we were able to cut taxes for middle class
   families. So something that I'd really like to concentrate on in my
   second term is being in a much more constant conversation with the
   American people so that they can put pressure on Congress to help move
   some of these issues forward." This isn't at odds with the 2008
   message; it's the whole point behind "yes we can."

   Second Update: Romney mentioned Obama's remarks three times at the
   beginning of his rally in Sarasota. It's almost as if our political
   discourse is getting dumber as the election draws closer.

   I hope what Obama says is true. If Democrats could ever accept that the
   GOP doesn't compromise, they could use that too their advantage by
   getting the GOP to engage in the tactics that cost them at the ballot
   box over and over again.

   Because Democrats never give up hope the GOP can change - and GOP
   obstruction only pays if Democrats play into it by reaching across the
   aisle - Democrats will play Lucy to the GOP football over and over
   again. (Obama, yet again, has expressed optimism the GOP will learn.)
   Embracing failed GOP ideas to gain their cooperation will fail, giving
   the GOP the opportunity to come back to power in an anti-incumbent
   election without having learned anything at all as happened this last
   midterm.

   The only thing that will break this cycle is for the Democrats to
   abandon their cyclical belief that this time, the GOP will learn its
   lesson and instead govern under the assumption GOP obstruction is the
   norm and operate in a manner that costs the GOP politically when they
   do obstruct, rather than in a manner meant to woo them over, thus
   enabling the GOP to be rewarded for taking the opening to screw them.

   The GOP won't learn. Eventually they'll lose enough times that the
   obstructionists will all end up working on K-street after their
   electoral defeats, and a new batch will move in. That new breed of
   Republican won't win unless they have a different philosophy from the
   losing one.

   I would hope the comment is a prelude to the President running against
   a do-nothing Congress. This may be the time to make the argument
   because he has tried bipartisanship and that didn't work out. It would
   seem natural because Romney is stumbling badly and Obama may be free to
   begin a campaign against Republican obstruction. This would not be just
   for the benefit of the down ticket races, but the possibility of a
   Republican Congress in one or both chambers. Obama can strengthen his
   hand if voters agree and public opinion continues to run high against
   the Republicans after the election.

   The public can either re-elect obstructionist Republicans and then

   Obama needs to maintain a conciliatory tone for dealing with Congress.
   Once the elections are over, he will be free to go over their heads and
   appeal directly to the people. This may be necessary to get a jobs and

   The polyanna view of a novice grassroots organizer would be to say- if
   only we had tens of thousands of people emailing and calling their GOP
   congressperson, then there would have been a compromise on the deficit
   plan.

   Does Obama believe that? Or does he understand that the Tea Party
   congresspersona had exactly the view that Romney does- that "those
   people" deluging them with calls to compromise don't matter, and no
   number of grassroots complaints or protests would change their view.

   If so, then the way "grassroots" organizing works is mobilizing brutal
   electoral ground campaigns, district by district, and state by state.
   You do it the LBJ way- those who don't bend get annihilated in their
   elections. We take back the house and we take back enough in the state
   legislatures to ratify constitutional electoral reform amendments which
   cripple plutocratic power for the next 100 years.

   The problem is that I am not seeing a huge mobilization of a ground
   campaign, or a recognition of the error of allowing the Obama for
   America organization to radically demobilize after 2008. I see more
   technocratic campaigning techniques that do not work because of
   grassroots volunteers, but works in spite of the "herding cats" problem
   and their fickle, often unreliable natures.

   Obama is not naive to believe that mobilizing people to call and mail
   their congress critter is going to be enough to stop Republicans from
   obstruction. But a large public opinion supporting Obama can make some
   Republicans afraid, particularly the ones who are not in very safe
   districts and are facing reelection in 2014. The possibility of loss of
   control of a chamber will make Republicans bend. These reps are not
   going to be Tea Party people who will remain intractable unless they
   sustain major losses this election.

   I am not optimistic they will bend. Billions of dollars in campaign
   funding tends to insulate the non TP politicians from anxiety. As for
   the TPs- I don't see them getting less ideological. They have to be
   voted out, and moderate GOP candidates aren't going to make that happen
   anytime soon.

   LBJ could make people bend because they feared him and trusted him to
   make good a promise to help when they needed help. Obama has no such
   long term relationships (Matthews thinks he should have developed
   some-- Woodward refers to it as his aloofness) but pick your most savvy
   legislative operator- even if a Pelosi were in the White House, I am
   afraid you would have had the same outcome.

   The GOP needs to be routed in the House before they will change their
   ways. Picking up a slim majority is not good enough. They need a good
   shellacking and the way to do that is a heavily funded national
   organization, with long term strategic goals (eg. development of
   sufficient ratification votes for constitutional amendments).

   Like so many things we often tend to think the idea/goal is to convince
   the other side to cooperate. Often the idea is instead to give our side
   the cover to move or to remind them what we care about when they listen
   too much to certain "advisers". It is also about giving the press
   something more in our favor to do--August 2009 seems a relevant example
   of the other side employing this to great extent. Just look at volumes
   of words written on any subject under the sun by right-wing writers and
   bloggers that always seem to rank higher when doing a Google search.
   You just about have to enter a site name to get any other view. They
   don't do that to convince lefty folks do they?

   The President did not understand that the right viewed his compromises
   as not seeking common ground, but an invasion of their ground. They
   suddenly found that once pleasant ground tainted by something other
   than them. That is, they had zero interest in being under the same big
   American tent, and in fact their self identity is to be anything other
   than what the more progressive half the nation believes.

   The upshot is that there is no point chasing them or seeking a
   Clintonesque third way. These well meaning endeavors take us in the
   opposite direction, and by their definition returns nothing for us to
   show for our mad race to the right.

   Turnabout is fair play. How about this for the game.

   They can chase us, and attempt to slow us down.

   Obama needs to read a good Harry Truman biography: Truman won in 1948
   because he identified the real problem in Washington, CD. C. at that
   time" "the Repoblican "do-nothing Congress".

   Obama seems to think that if he refrains from attacking the "Republican
   Obstructionist do-nothing Congress" this year they might cooperate with
   him if he wins this year. The fact is that they will ooperate with
   Obama only when pigs fly! Now Schumer thinks the same; how dumb can

   This Ben Smith?

   [60]The Audacity of Truth

   [61]http://soupsoup.tumblr.com/post/30683988863/the-audacity-of-truth

   Ben Smith at [62]Buzzfeed has a post called "Pants on Fire Politics"
   which sub headline is "The Democrats' attack on Republican honesty is a
   campaign ploy, not an argument."

   I realize Ben is using "democrats" as his scapegoat here, but
   throughout the article he's either pointing to different journalists or
   blaming them for being duped by the party into bothering to check the
   facts. If these journalists fail to do the same thing with lies the
   Obama campaign tells, I would gladly agree with him.

   He goes on to say, regarding [63]two [64]articles calling out Paul Ryan
   over lies he's told as

     "a casual read could mistake this for evidence about Ryan's
     character. It is, in fact, something approaching the opposite"

   What else is it but evidence about his character? What else are we to
   judge a candidate on other than what they do and what they say, and how
   they distort the facts about themselves and the people they hope to
   defeat on their way to public office?

   Ben continues

     The Democrats are hoping to do to Paul Ryan what Republicans so
     successfully did to Al Gore: To conflate stray real personal
     exaggerations; rhetorical simplifications; and actual policy
     differences into an unfair character attack.

   The personal exaggeration refers to [65]Ryan lying about his marathon
   time, which in isolation would be a forgivable white lie, but given how
   many other documented occurrences now where Ryan has willfully lied
   about easily refutable facts, it seems to fall into a pattern.

   A "rhetorical simplification" is probably a great way to describe the
   explanation journalists like to use to help us poor dear readers
   understand why we shouldn't make such a big deal about what politicians
   say in their speeches. Some journalists will have you believe that
   speeches are also rhetorical simplifications of facts used to drive
   home a larger point.

   Aiding those rhetorical simplifications in Ryan's RNC speech alone are
   clear lies. We can discuss policy difference if we both agree on the
   same set of facts. There are [66]records and [67]data and [68]votes
   that have been cast, [69]legislation that has been blocked and passed,
   actions that any journalist can easily point to. Instead we hear
   journalists, especially on cable news, where I'd generously refer to
   them as "pundits," acting like they're doing us some public service by
   explaining how politics works.

   I wish someone in the media would look into the following more and ask
   Ryan about it:

   1. Paul Ryan's financial disclosure forms for Congress that were made
   public, showed he and his wife own stake in 4 family companies that
   lease land in Texas and Oklahoma to energy companies that benefit from
   the tax subsidies in Ryan's Budget plan. "Ryan's father-in-law, Daniel
   Little, who runs the companies, told Newsweek and The Daily Beast that
   the family companies are currently
   leasing the land for mining and drilling to energy giants such as
   Chesapeake
   Energy, Devon, and XTO Energy, a recently acquired subsidiary of
   ExxonMobil"

   When asked about the blatant conflict of interest, Ryan's spokesperson
   offered up the newly-popular "wife" defense: Ryan's office says the
   congressman wasn't
   thinking about himself or the oil companies that lease his land when he
   drafted
   the budget blueprint that extended the energy tax breaks. "These are
   properties that Congressman Ryan married into," spokesman Kevin Seifert
   said. "It's not something he has a lot of control over."
   [73]http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/06/17/247570/paul-ryan-family
   -beneft-subsidies-for-big-oil-in-his-budget/

   2. Did Paul Ryan benefit from news Congress received about the
   financial crisis in 2008 and would it show on his tax returns. Is there
   any truth to this story: "September 18, 2008 the day Fed Chairman Ben
   Bernanke and then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson broke the news to
   congressional leaders that they would have to approve a bailout to
   avert a complete meltdown of the financial system.
   Checking through Ryan's financial disclosure reports, the Richmonder
   discovered that Ryan had sold the stocks of several major banks that
   day, while
   purchasing - surprise! - stock in Paulson's old firm Goldman Sachs. The
   story
   quickly circulated through the media. The Romney campaign rapidly
   issued denials, based on three separate -- and clearly false -- claims:
   1) the trades were not individual stock trades, but trades made as part
   of an index that trades big blocs of stocks according to preset
   formulas; 2) the meeting took place in the evening, after markets were
   closed, so the meeting could not have played a role in Ryan's trading
   decisions; and 3) the stocks traded within a trust over which Ryan had
   no direct authority."

   They continue to think they can win the election solely by attacking

   understand that strategy is really all they have, since there really is
   no reason to vote for Romney. Still, it hasn't been terribly effective

   We know why the Republicans are jumping on this comment. But what about
   the press?

   Here's my theory based on what I've observed in recent years. The
   mainstream media doesn't seem to like presidential elections where one
   side is pounding the other. It's not good for business. They like close
   races, and as far as I can tell, they will do their part to keep the
   race close. As far as they're concerned, Romney got picked on for
   awhile. Now it's Obama's turn.

   This is the reason that Democratic voters cannot get complacent. Not
   for day...not for a moment.

   One of my bigger disappointments with Obama has been his reluctance to
   appear TOO partisan. IMHO, after the hostile hateful attempts to block
   his stimulus package and the Affordable Care Act - while simultaneously
   calling it all akin to socialism YET NEVER OFFERING ANYTHING ELSE TO
   ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS - Obama was in his rights to start shouting to
   the mountaintops "I can't get anything done with this Congress. They
   are not acting in good faith, they want America to fail rather than see
   a Democratic President help get something done that benefits the
   American people. If this makes you as mad as it makes me, elect me a
   better Congress." Can you imagine how much conceivably better the 2010
   midterms could have been if he simply said that, "Send me a better
   Congress and we'll make a better America?"

   But no, that would have been too partisan. We are soooooo much better
   off where we are.

   You know, no one has brought this up yet.

   It is bad enough that Romney has nothing for the 47% and is not even
   interested in talking to them, but what he is REALLY saying then, is
   that he has contempt for the 53% also, because if that is the only
   group he is actually "talking" to, then he obviously thinks they are
   gullible and stupid and will believe ANYTHING he says!

   It can only be that he has no respect for the intelligence of 53% that
   he won't release his taxes, that he refuses to come up with any real
   plans with real details!

   It can only be that he has no respect for the intelligence of the 53%
   that he says one thing to one group, and then the opposite to another
   group, knowing that both statements will be broadcast and written
   about, and that each group will hear what he is saying to the other.

   If the 53% group is the only ones he is politicking to, he obviously
   disdains them more than he does the 47%!

   You know....can you imagine if Ed, Chris, and Rachel were on the side
   of the GOP instead of the leftie Dems? Think about it.

   All 3 of them would be having a hay day full of material for their
   shows....with all that is going on with Obama and his "administration"

   1. Blaming a terrorist attack on our country on the anniversary of 9/11
   on a video and saying it was not a terrorist attack.

   2. A DOJ with all the fast and furious scandal going on.

   3. Going on Letterman, with Hollywood stars, the View...and saying he
   is too busy to meet with the Russian leader.

   4. Playing golf over 150 times since in office.

   5. The job numbers, the unemployment numbers, the debt he has added,
   ...etc.

   6. GM going down the tubes...even after the bail out. Stock at all time
   low. GM wants to buy the company back from Obama but he won't sell
   because the stock is so low.

   I could go on and on and on.

   All 3 of them would have it made. Imagine for a moment that they were
   attacking Obama and all he has done and what he stands for instead of
   attacking Romney.

   I mean, Ed spends a whole week of shows on the 47% deal. Ignores all of
   the other big things going on in our country. You know Ed, there are no
   words for you..........................other than you are the King of
   the lowest rated show on the lowest rated network in the good ole USA.
   Keep up the good work

   Obama's right, only we outside can change DC, and our statehouses, by
   voting for non-obstructionists, people we can trust to be reasonable
   and govern. At the end of an era, that means a straight Democratic
   ticket.

   Then, if the millenial generation organizes around their concerns --
   creating an equal shot for all, rule of law, transparency, and a strong
   economy benefiting from industrial systems without carbon energy's
   unintended consequences, so we can grow our way out of the deficit --
   that generation will be on the "left", leaving Obama and then Hillary
   on the right. I could be very happy with that.

   I hope this president will ask us to do it.

   The payroll tax extension just in the last year is a perfect example of
   what Obama was talking about. The GOPs initial plan was not to vote for
   it but after they started hearing a lot of blowback from constituents
   -- even those of their own party --- they capitulated. Politicians may
   have some personal convictions and party loyalty, but as you can see
   with the race to see who can distance themselves the fastest from
   Romney's "47%" comments, they usually will do whatever they think will
   help them win elections. That being the case, change with help from the
   outside is a most appropriate strategy.

   The root cause as to why the company Kodak went bankrupt was primarily
   because a few executives put their job security ahead of the company.
   They were so worried
   about being left behind in this digital age, that they sacrificed an
   entire
   company. This selfish act, by a few, impacted the livelihoods of
   thousand of
   people.

   At Kodak, it was extremely hard and damn near impossible for
   the thousands of minions to stop what happened. Though they were in a
   position
   to enact change they could have been silenced by being fired or simply
   ignored.
   In fact I have no clue if they did anything or not. We can learn from
   Kodak's
   example.

   The individuals who attacked the President's comments completely missed
   the point he was making, or they're ignoring it. I'm sure it's the
   latter. I have to believe that or I will go bonkers. The government
   isn't there just to lead the people, it is the people who need to lead
   the government or the agenda of the few will ruin us all!

   I don't mean to sound like a public service announcement, but it needs
   to be said. We should take Howard Beale's advice and let them, the
   "leaders" we elected, know that we are mad as hell and we are not going
   to take it anymore!

   "I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are
   bad. It's a
   depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The
   dollar
   buys a nickel's worth; banks are going bust; shopkeepers keep a gun
   under the
   counter; punks are running wild in the street, and there's nobody
   anywhere who
   seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.

   We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat. And
   we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today
   we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's
   the way it's supposed to be!

   We all know things are bad -- worse than bad -- they're crazy.

   It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out any
   more. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is
   getting smaller, and all we say is, "Please, at least leave us alone in
   our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted
   radials, and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone."

   Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.

   I want you to get mad!

   I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot. I don't want you
   to write to your
   Congressman, because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't
   know
   what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and
   the
   crime in the street.

   All I know is that first, you've got to get mad.

   You've gotta say,
   "I'm a human being, goddammit! My life has value!"'

   ~Paddy Chayefsky through his character Howard Beale from the movie 'The
   Network'

   And apparently Mitt Romney said the EXACT SAME THING in 2007:

   [146]http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2007/12/30/4429528-mitt-on-huck
   -mccain-ann

   change it from the outside."
