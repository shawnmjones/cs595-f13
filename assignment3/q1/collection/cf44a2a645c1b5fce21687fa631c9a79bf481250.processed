     * On the latest #TWiBRadio, we ask [32]Why Can't Negroes Understand
       How Awesome the GOP Is?
       And check out the discussion over at [33]#TWiBRadio, where Elon
       James White and crew break down the nonsense plus more.
     * Hopefully there's a non-bigoted band [34]looking for a guitarist:

     Democrat Mark Smith's support for same-sex marriage got him kicked
     out of the band.

     A Bradford County, Pa. commissioner running for lieutenant governor,
     Smith said band mates in the Christian rock group One Floor Away
     recently told him he would have to quit as lead guitarist unless he
     changed his position on the issue.
     Smith has spoken up for marriage equality on the campaign trail and
     on Facebook. He refused to renounce his support, and lost the
     opportunity to play music he loves for a band that is recording its
     first album and seems to be going places in the Christian rock
     scene.
     * If you're interested, the [35]tax returns of President and Michelle
       Obama, and Vice President Joe and Dr. Jill Biden.
     * The possible reason for this [36]decline is pretty funny:

     Uh oh. Teens are growing tired of Facebook (FB) and YouTube (GOOG),
     new research (pdf) shows, a falling-out that has the potential to
     trigger a wide-ranging effect on retail, fashion, gaming, and other
     youth-oriented industries.

     According to Piper Jaffray (PJC), while Facebook and YouTube are
     still considered the most important social media destination for
     teens, their popularity among this fickle demographic has fallen
     precipitously since this time last year, as the chart below
     indicates. (The cold-shoulder treatment may be because so many
     parents and grannies seem, creepily, to be all over Facebook these
     days.)
     * This day in history:
       [37][Tapper__normal.jpg] At 4:30am on this day in 1861, General
       Pierre Beauregard told troops to fire upon Fort Sumter and the
       Civil War began [38]http://t.co/...
       -- [39]@jaketapper via [40]TweetDeck
     * Really? [41]This was the first thing she thought of?

     The first words of a 79-year-old Michigan woman as she emerged from
     a five-year semi-coma were, "I want to go to a Bob Seger concert."
     And now her wish has come true.
     * [42]Quack:

     Security screeners at a Honolulu courthouse noticed something moving
     inside a defendant's bag as it passed through an X-ray machine
     earlier this week.

     After initially refusing to open it, the bag's owner reluctantly
     revealed that his pet was inside. When he opened the bag, screeners
     found a live duck and a bottle of beer, Department of Public Safety
     spokeswoman Toni Schwartz said.
     * The NRA should be all over this ... [43]proof that it's not just
       guns killing people!

     A fisherman in Belarus was bitten to death by a beaver, and all he
     was doing was trying to take its picture, Sky News reports. The man
     spotted the beaver while fishing with friends at Lake Shestakov, but
     as he approached to take a photograph, the beaver bit him on the
     thigh. The animal managed to sever an artery, and his friends
     couldn't stop the blood flow.
     * Okay, the [44]story is about ultra-Orthodox passengers being upset
       about a movie being shown on a flight, but this is the really weird
       part:

     This is not the first time that El Al is faced with problems with
     ultra-Orthodox people on board flights to religious sites. In 2002,
     a flight crew had to prevent an ultra-Orthodox passenger, flying
     from Israel to Britain, from wrapping himself in plastic bags. The
     pilot was forced to return to Ben Gurion International airport in
     order to remove the passenger from the plane. The passenger, a
     Cohen, wrapped himself in plastic bags for fear that the plane's
     route would pass through the air above the Holon cemetery and he
     would consequently become impure.
     * [45]Ouch:

     The third most popular song in Britain is 74 years old and was
     originally sung by Munchkins.

     "Ding Dong the Witch is Dead" has not been re-released, nor has it
     been covered by a popular artist. The original Judy Garland version
     of the Wizard of Oz classic that celebrates the death of the wicked
     witch has reached #1 in UK iTunes and has sold almost 30,000 copies
     thanks to an online campaign by people who are celebrating the death
     of Britain's only female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [59]Tagging tips - [60]Search For Tags - [61]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [62]Civil
   Rights, [63]Community, [64]Congress, [65]Culture, [66]Economy,
   [67]Education, [68]Elections, [69]Energy, [70]Environment, [71]Health
   Care, [72]International, [73]Labor, [74]Law, [75]Media, [76]Meta,
   [77]National Security, [78]Science, [79]Transportation, or [80]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([81]California, [82]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

       Episodes are all on History Channel's website.  Great writing,
       great cinematography, great cast and acting. The protagonist is
       Ragnar Lothbrok, an actual historical figure in Viking/Norse
       history.  They have room to take dramatic liberties with some
       things, because most of what is known about him is from the English
       and French writings of the people whom he and his Vikings raided,
       but they also delve into the Norse mythology.

   smacks neo-nazis around and saves abused little girls, and in a show
   that's always brilliantly written and paced and studded with amazing
   acting talent, had me hooked from the pilot on - ain't missed one yet
   in the first 4 seasons.

   For those unfamiliar, it's about a deputy US Marshall from Harlan (coal
   country) KY. Season 1 pits him against his boyhood chum's (dug coal
   together) crime family and his skinhead pals.

   Season 2 he faces off against a local matriarch, played brililiantly by
   Margo Martindale, and her criminal sons.

   Season 3 it's the Detroit mob looking to control the heroin trade in
   Harlan and its chief enforcer dude looking to stay in .

   Season 4 has a human as the Maguffin being sought. A great, slowly
   unwinding mystery with a great finish.

       of the show was when Dewey robbed the people who robbed the oxy

       arrest Dewey to save him, followed by Boyd dragging the guy from
       the car who wanted to enlist him in the mine robbery (where Boyd

       I had a friend while we were in the Navy who had been a PoliSci
       student at John Hopkins U. When Reagan was elected, he went up the
       chain of command telling them he could no longer uphold his
       enlistment oath to protect the president since Reagan, as governor
       of California, had enacted loop holes allowing discrimination
       against blacks in real estate dealings.
       They questioned him thoroughly and ended up giving him an honorable
       discharge.

   the Sex Pistols' "God Save The Queen" - which was officially barred

       on the part of the article's writer, unless s/he actually didn't
       know what that was about.
       "Cohen" here doesn't refer to the surname but to the hereditary
       priestly caste (more commonly spelled "Kohen," plural "Kohanim"),
       members of which are subject to certain religious laws that don't
       apply to non-Kohanim.
       One of these laws has to do with ritual purity.  Coming into the
       presence of a corpse conveys a level of ritual impurity; under most
       circumstances, a Kohen is only permitted to do this for the burial
       of members of his immediate family.  Walking over ground where a
       corpse is buried counts as being in its presence, as does being in
       an enclosed area where a corpse is, such as a cemetery.  (This can
       complicate, although not necessarily forbid outright, things like
       visiting a relative in a hospital ... or going to a museum with
       exhibits that include, for instance, mummified or fossilized human
       remains.)
       Prior to this article I had never heard anyone suggest that being
       in an airplane flying over a cemetery would count as walking over a
       grave, but ... apparently there is some rabbinic authority saying
       so.  Oh, my people.

     Republicans Mangle Facts To Attack Obama's Missile Defense Budget

     Republicans in Congress came out swinging against what they label as
     the Obama administration's cuts to military spending in its new
     budget, specifically citing the threat North Korea's missiles pose
     as a reason to preserve missile defense spending. A close read of
     the Pentagon's weapon procurement plans, however, show an increase
     in spending to the missile defense programs most closely related to
     countering North Korea.

     Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-CO) made headlines on Thursday when he
     inadvertently revealed a still secret Defense Intelligence Agency
     asessment of North Korea's nuclear weapons program. In one segment
     of the DIA's assessment, which was mistakenly labeled as
     unclassified in the copy provided to Congress, the Pentagon spy
     agency determined North Korea "has nuclear weapons capable of
     delivery by ballistic missiles; however, the reliability will be
     low."

     Lamborn defended the disclosure after the meeting, as he was worried
     that the Obama administration isn't doing enough to fund missile
     defense:

        "My whole goal in bringing this to light was to make sure we
     don't cut missile defense spending," the congressman said. "At the
     worst possible time, the President's budget does exactly that."

     Republicans like Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon (R-CA), Chairman of the
     House Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Randy Forbes (R-VA) also
     seized on the North Korean crisis to attack the Obama
     administration's proposed Fiscal Year 2014 budget on Friday --
     despite the fact that baseline spending is actually up by $1
     billion. And while missile defense spending is cut $550 million in
     the President's proposal, those cuts are primarily due to cancelling
     the Medium Extended Air Defense System, which the Pentagon has said
     it doesn't want. In fact, Lamborn's specific worry so far as it
     relates to North Korea is concerned is demonstrably false.

   I kept hearing this refrain all week and it caught in my ear every
   time.

   Until Britain is finished, how do we know she's the only female PM?
   I'd describe her as "first", or the "only one so far", but "only"?
   That just doesn't sound right to me.

   Oh yeah, and good riddance to both her and St. Reagan.  I was but a lad

 @#$^%@$%^ IRS and turbotax. ([611]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [612]Gentle Giant

   So, reluctantly, I coughed up the cash for turbotax to make sure I
   didn't screw up filling out my tax returns.  Want to be legit with the
   gov't, so I dutifully entered in the measly $330 of income I got last
   year, along with the money I took out of my IRAs to pay for school.

   Got everything filled out, went to use my 'free federal e-file!' and
   found out I can't file electronically, because that $330 meant I get a
   $25 refund from the feds, and because my earnings were so puny, I never
   got any documentation from the guy I did the work for.  Without the
   documentation, you have to physically mail the forms in.

   And, of course, turbotax doesn't offer any sort of option to waive the
   refund, so you can just lose the $25 and e-file.  The only way it would
   let me ditch the $25 refund is to lie and claim I had no income at all
   last year.

   And I can't transfer the 'free federal e-file' to state, since I can't
   use the free e-file at federal.  And they want to charge me $20 to file
   state.

   So it looks like I'll be paying to mail my returns in for state and
   federal on paper this year.

 I think back when I had set up an LLC ([620]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [621]JeffW

       that ended up doing absolutely nothing but sit there, I was paying
       $130 a year to have taxes done for it, and the accountant was
       always screwing me over by filing extensions, which meant I had to
       file extensions on my personal taxes as well, until she could be
       bothered to do the LLC taxes.Needless to say, after a couple of
       years, I simply let it fold and quit wasting the money for the
       accountant.
       Way I figure it, though, I've only got one more year I'll want to
       use turbotax, because I'll have finished draining absolutely every
       IRA, piece of stock, and other such asset I've ever owned this
       year, and any future tax filings will consist of a W-2, if any, and
       the EZ form.
       And I'll be damned if I'm going to create any more IRAs or do any
       'investing' ever again.  Pointless way to simply hand over money to
       finance people and create tax headaches for myself.  It's back to
       cash on the barrelhead and no work that doesn't generate enough
       money for whoever wants to hire me to actually fill out a W-2.
