   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [44]Tagging tips - [45]Search For Tags - [46]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   Are you sure you want to remove this diary from your hotlist?

   I fixed it. Sorry everyone. Youtube changed video embedding on us. Here
   is the takeaway:

   YouTube thoughtfully changed their embed code Thursday in such a way
   that embeds are breaking on our site.

   We have a fix in place that will go up monday. In the meantime, if you
   use video, you'll have to follow this extra step for your video to
   show:

   Copy the embed code, for example:

   <div class="dkimg-c"><iframe width="550" height="309"
   src="//www.youtube.com/embed/fsszNpUAb-U" frameborder="0"
   allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

   Change it to

   <div class="dkimg-c"><iframe width="550" height="309"
   src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fsszNpUAb-U" frameborder="0"
   allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

   did you catch that?

   after the src=

   change

   src="//
   src="http://

   IE: when you preview your story, or your comment, and you see a big
   blank spot where you thought a video would be, that is real, not your
   browser f'ing up. No video will be shown.

   Thanks all, and sorry for the inconvenience.

   Fry, don't be a hero! It's not covered by our health plan!

   You've got to manually type the "http:" into the YouTube embed code...

   about her 2011 filibuster?

     Texas Democrats never had much hope in this Legislature, where
     Republicans have a huge majority and an unshakeable drive to slash
     spending without raising taxes or dipping into the state's giant
     savings account.

     Don't tell that to State Senator Wendy Davis. The Democrat of Fort
     Worth effectively torpedoed the 82nd legislative session by refusing
     to settle for a school finance plan that would leave public schools
     $4 billion short.

     Ms. Davis's Senate filibuster last Sunday night -- which prompted
     Gov. Rick Perry to send exhausted lawmakers, poised to adjourn
     Monday after a grueling budget battle, back into an immediate
     special session -- has quickly become legend.

   who love to restrict vaginas think Rick Perry went too far with the
   attack on Sen. Davis:

     "Disagreements over policy are important and they're healthy, but
     when he crosses the line into the personal, then he damages himself
     and he damages the Republican Party," Straus told The Texas Tribune.

     Colorado Parade Canceled After Tea Party Group Threatens Armed March

     A group of Tea Party members caused fear that a Colorado town's 4th
     of July parade won't be safe to attend because they'll be carrying
     weapons.

     The town of Westcliffe normally has a lively 4th of July parade
     every year and is described as the busiest day for businesses. This
     year, however, citizens were afraid of what will happen with as many
     as 300 people marching with guns slung on their shoulders.

     The Southern Colorado Patriots' Club sent a out a flier advertising
     the parade and instructing members to bring unloaded rifles,
     "especially the evil black ones."

     The Custer County Chamber of Commerce, the event's sponsor,
     cancelled the parade after fearful citizens circulated a petition to
     stop the club. Donna Hood, president of the chamber, abstained from
     the vote to cancel the parade but told the Denver Post that the
     controversy has "polarized this community in a week."

     Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) continued to lambaste state Sen. Wendy
     Davis (D) in an interview with right-wing radio host Laura Ingraham
     on Friday, under the guise of praising her accomplishments.

     According to Burnt Orange Report, Perry attempted to explain remarks
     he made on Thursday about Davis being a young mother by telling
     Ingraham, "I said I was proud of what Wendy had accomplished in her
     life. I'm sad that she does not understand that every life is
     precious, and certainly her own."

   This man just executed his 260th-something prisoner, and he has the
   gall to say something like this to Senator Davis?
