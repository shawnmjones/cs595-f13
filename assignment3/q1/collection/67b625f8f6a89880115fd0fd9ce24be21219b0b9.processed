     * "I won't stand for someone mocking the tragic deaths," Perry says
     * Cartoonist says he stands by his work
     * The cartoon was published the same day as the memorial for victims

   (CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry is demanding an apology from a
   California newspaper that published a cartoon that seemed to link his
   push for less regulations to the recent [41]fertilizer plant explosion
   that killed 14.

   "The Sacramento Bee published a disgusting 'cartoon' mocking the deadly
   explosion in West. While I will always welcome healthy policy debate, I
   won't stand for someone mocking the tragic deaths of my fellow Texans
   and our fellow Americans. I have written the editor and asked that they
   apologize to the citizens of West," Perry wrote on his official
   Facebook page.

   [42]An editor at the paper defended the cartoon.

   "Jack Ohman's cartoon of April 25 made a strong statement about Gov.
   Rick Perry's disregard for worker safety, and his attempts to market
   Texas as a place where industries can thrive with few regulations,"
   said Stuart Leavenworth, the paper's editorial page editor. "It is
   unfortunate that Gov. Perry, and some on the blogosphere, have
   attempted to interpret the cartoon as being disrespectful of the
   victims of this tragedy."

   Editorial Cartoonist Jack Ohman also responded to some reader criticism
   of his cartoon in a column Thursday.

   [43]Ohman said he stood by the cartoon and listed many reasons he
   believes Perry's policies deserve scrutiny.

   "The Texas governor's campaigning notwithstanding, should I have used
   the explosion as a vehicle to illustrate my point? I did. I stand by
   it," Ohman wrote.

   The cartoon, published Thursday, shows Perry standing at a podium in
   front of signs about lower taxes and lower regulations proclaiming
   "Business is booming in Texas."

   The next frame of the cartoon shows a huge explosion alluding to the
   April 17 fertilizer plant tragedy in West, Texas, that killed 14
   people, injured up to 200 and destroyed more than 100 homes.

   Days after the cartoon was published, it was still drawing mostly
   negative responses on the Sacramento Bee website.

   The explosion created a crater nearly 100 feet wide and 10 feet deep,
   and devastated the small town. Officials are still trying to determine
   what caused the fire that lead to the explosion.

   Perry said he was offended the cartoon was published Thursday, the same
   day the governor, President Barack Obama and many others gathered for a
   memorial for the victims.

   "Publishing this on the very day our state and nation paused to honor
   and mourn those who died only compounds the pain and suffering of the
   many Texans," Perry wrote.
