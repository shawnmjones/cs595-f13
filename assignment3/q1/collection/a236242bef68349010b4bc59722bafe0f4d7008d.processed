court opinions

   Electronic surveillance
   A bipartisan group of eight senators introduced new legislation Tuesday
   that would require the Attorney General to reveal how the
   administration interprets the laws governing the massive surveillance
   programs conducted by the NSA. It would require the declassification of
   the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's opinions, a press release
   from Sen. Jeff Merkley [30]states, "allowing Americans to know how
   broad of a legal authority the government is claiming to spy on
   Americans under the PATRIOT Act and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
   Act."

     "Americans deserve to know how much information about their private
     communications the government believes it's allowed to take under
     the law," Merkley said. "There is plenty of room to have this debate
     without compromising our surveillance sources or methods or tipping
     our hand to our enemies.  We can't have a serious debate about how
     much surveillance of Americans' communications should be permitted
     without ending secret law."

   He's joined by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who along with Sen. Mark Udall
   (C-CO), has been [31]trying for two years to have these secret
   interpretations aired. Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT),
   Dean Heller (R-NV), Mark Begich (D-AK), Al Franken (D-MN) and Jon
   Tester (D-MT) have signed on.

   This effort might actually help in the long stymied efforts to get
   these decisions declassified. The Electronic Frontiers Foundation has
   been involved in a [32]byzantine effort under the Freedom of
   Information Act to see one particular opinion and has been ping-ponged
   between a district court, the FISC and the Justice Department, as all
   three play hot potato with the request. The ACLU has also [33]just sued
   the government to compel the declassification of its interpretation of
   section 215, the so-called "business records" provision of the Patriot
   Act. A key, though perhaps reluctant ally [34]for this effort is the
   chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

     In February, the chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee,
     Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif), and four other senators, including
     Merkley, wrote the Fisa Court asking to "declassify opinions of this
     court that are assessed to contain a significant interpretation of
     the law." They continued: "We believe that decisions of this court
     contain important rulings of the law that, if declassified, would
     inform public debate over Fisa [the Foreign Intelligence
     Surveillance Act] that are subject to sunset in 2015 and 2017."

   Feinstein is now on the record demanding this declassification. Her
   counterpart on Judiciary, Patrick Leahy, is now on board with this
   legislative effort. Which is bipartisan! Both sides want it! Red state
   senators and blue state senators and purple state senators all agree:
   The people have a right to know if the government is actually following
   the law.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [57]Tagging tips - [58]Search For Tags - [59]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [60]Civil
   Rights, [61]Community, [62]Congress, [63]Culture, [64]Economy,
   [65]Education, [66]Elections, [67]Energy, [68]Environment, [69]Health
   Care, [70]International, [71]Labor, [72]Law, [73]Media, [74]Meta,
   [75]National Security, [76]Science, [77]Transportation, or [78]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([79]California, [80]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       which is described by Wikipedia  . ..

     The law reduces air pollution controls, including those
     environmental protections of the Clean Air Act, including caps on
     toxins in the air and budget cuts for enforcement. The Act is
     opposed by conservationist groups such as the Sierra Club with Henry
     A. Waxman, a Democratic congressman of California, describing its
     title as "clear propaganda."

     Among other things, the Clear Skies Act:

     Weakens the current cap on nitrogen oxide pollution levels from 1.25

 Do It ([435]0+ / 0-)

   Yes, we should legitimize and normalize the programme. There is an
   important role for signals intelligence, including in the US. That role
   is vastly smaller and more subject to actual oversight than anything
   we're doing.

   But dismissing any effort to limit the spying as approving it is
   counterproductive. The way any in-progress programme is controlled is
   to start with some limits, which tend to legitimize and normalize it.
   We will never, say, jail a criminal spymaster. So this action deserves
   aggressive support. "Aggressive" as in "just getting started".

 I think that it is already normalized ([440]0+ / 0-)
       in the sense that you are talking about it.  That ship sailed in
       2006.
       What is not yet normalized conceptually is a limitless and
       unchecked secret domestic spying.  That is where I believe they are
       going to go with any efforts to address the Snowden revelations in
       this Congress.
       The state secrets circle jerk is going to continue.
       Americans will get used to the occasional person being victimized
       as a result of abuses that they won't ever be privy to.  A
       contingent of people will become more radicalized and obsessed with
       threats they perceive the government to be to them personally, but
       they'll be either off the grid in some cabin or sorted out one way
       or another by the spying apparatus.
       At some point, it won't be clear and people really won't care
       whether things that happen to them in their lives are an act of god
       or an act of the secret spying apparatus.  They will go on with
       their daily lives and feel safe because that's what they want to
       do.
       On top of all of that, it is a growth industry.  More and more

       they will into the future.

   I'm conflicted on this issue and have been a little put off by the
   absolute positions this issue brings out.  Clearly, the government
   should not be able to have access to all communications metadata or be
   able to use it without probable cause.  Clearly, the process which
   determines probable cause cannot be walled off from society and be
   without public oversight.  The sheer volume and nature of metadata
   means that businesses and governments already can get this information,
   so we'd better have systems in place to regulate its use and punish its
   abuse.  Simply banning government access to metadata is not going to
   work. The information is collected, it's out there, and it's simply
   part of the environment. There needs to be independent and transparent
   oversight on how its used.  This seems like an obvious first step.

   The FISA Court is generally not being presented with cases or
   controversies. Instead it is being presented with applications for
   surveillance authorizations under the Patriot Act. Thus, there are no
   court decisions to publish, just investigative applications that are
   never made public until after charges are filed. It is an investigative
   tool that is being used. If the applying agencies find out something
   about you that will lead to charges being filed, they will find a way
   to "discover" your activity without implicating their surveillance.

   It's like Churchill did not evacuate Coventry when he knew the Germans
   were going to bomb that city, as doing so would have revealed to the
   Germans that the enigma ciphers had been broken.

   "We are afraid. Please authorize a warrant so we can track all of the
   daily activities of every citizen!" simply fails the test of "probable
   cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and partiularly describing the
   place to be searched, and the persons or thing to be seized," as
   required by the Fourth Amendment.

   The Fourth Amendment requires the government to be able to state that
   it believes something is afoot, not to assert that if it can track
   everyone it is sure it can find foul play at work. Simply stated, the
   Fourth Amendment requires the horse to be in front of the cart, not
   behind it.

     The poll is a reminder that many Americans do not hold especially
     firm views on some issues and instead may adapt them depending on
     which party controls the executive branch. When it comes to domestic
     surveillance, a considerable number of Democrats seem willing to
     support actions under President Obama that they deemed unacceptable
     under George W. Bush, while some Republicans have shifted in the
     opposite direction.
       Indeed, most of what we are hearing everywhere is just partisan
       patter.
       The reality is that both parties are enthusiastic supporters of the
       national security state, and the entire neocon agenda is now

     In the case of the Patriot Act vote, the establishment-outsider axis

   [715]today's hits today.

     3m ago

     David Axelrod, the president's former top political strategist, said
     on television Monday that Edward Snowden is "a whistleblower who
     then blew the country."

     Axelrod was speaking on Lawrence O'Donnell's show on MSNBC. Mediate
     caught his remarks:

         "My question is of Mr. Snowden, is he could have gone to the
     Congress," Axelrod [said]. "He could have gone to the Inspector
     General. This is a peculiar route he took.

         "I mean, he's a whistleblower who then blew the country."

     It is unclear whether Snowden considered Axelrod's solution here of
     going to Congress with his concerns. Snowden may have had reason to
     doubt that Congress would fly into action to fix what he saw as
     broken. The flat denial of James Clapper, the director of national
     intelligence, in March that the NSA collects "any type of data at
     all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans" was allowed to
     pass into the public record unchecked by Senator Dianne Feinstein
     (DiFi), who knew better. Moments like that on Capitol Hill may have
     contributed to Snowden's skepticism.

     So I guess now that DiFi is calling Snowden a traitor for exposing
     that she lets Clapper lie under oath, that means she won't cite
     Clapper?

 Charge Clapper with Perjury ([750]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [751]wavpeac, [752]YucatanMan

   National Intelligence Director Clapper should be charged with perjury.
   He repeatedly told Congress, in public hearings and reportedly (by
   congressmembers) in private conferences, that the NSA wasn't collecting
   this vast, unlimited data on Americans. He simply lied. That is a
   serious crime.

   Lying to Congress about violating the Constitution at Internet scales
   is a more serious crime than, say, Bradley Manning's leaking thousands
   of US government cables, many of which contain evidence of other
   crimes. But Manning has been tortured in prison for years, while
   Clapper continues to spy on every American.

   Clapper should be tried and jailed. No justice, no peace.

       Obamas biggest and most telling mistake is his refusal to use the
       laws of our country to hold folks accountable, to allow due
       process. All this controlling the outcomes is a refusal of reality
       and when we fight the truth, we are bound, gagged and controlled by
       the lie. Obama took on the criminal bushco like a big bumbling
       enabling co dependent. Co dependency kills because it over throws

 Today, a couple Congress people explained how ([777]0+ / 0-)
       these briefings work:  You go into a room. No cell phones allowed.
        You may bring in pencil and paper, but you cannot take it out. You
       may take notes, but you cannot take them out.
       You are allowed to review certain documents.  The language is heavy
       with bureaucratese and difficult to follow for any person, let
       alone someone in this odd security room with only very limited time
       to review the documents.  A time frame is set before you enter and
       adhered to strictly.
       No one can remember all that stuff.  The best they can do is as
       Wyden has been doing: get the general gist, dig into what you can,
       then make veiled references to the secrets you've seen which you
       object to, but without revealing anything at all.  And you've only
       absorbed very little.
       One statement was made by the White House today which was
       hilarious:  "Any Congressmember may request a briefing at any time
       and we will provide that briefing."
       The Congressmembers speaking about this said how ridiculous that
       statement was.  Sure, they can request a briefing, but you have to
       specify exactly what about.  How can you specify what you want to
       be briefed upon without knowing the programs under way or their
       contents?
       It was a classic Catch 22.
       The Obama White House has never been as dishonest as they are being
       now. Never.

   I think the paranoia over government access to this data is excessive,
   but I think that paranoia is bred by the excessive levels of secrecy we
   have around these programs. When U.S. Senators could be arrested for
   merely mentioning that they exist then you know we have gone to far.

   If Wyden and others could actually talk about these programs in general
   without getting into the specifics then maybe some of the ignorance
   about just what these programs do would be lifted and the paranoia
   would be decreased.
