   Birmingham, Alabama (CNN) -- The pilot and co-pilot of a UPS cargo
   plane did not issue a distress call prior to crashing while on approach
   Wednesday to Birmingham's airport, a National Transportation Safety
   Board official said.

   While UPS said the status of its crew remained unconfirmed, Birmingham
   Airport Authority Chairwoman Gaynell Hendricks and the city's mayor
   confirmed the pilot and co-pilot died in the crash.

   "It's a grim scene," Hendricks told [41]CNN affiliate WBRC.

   The plane, an Airbus A300-600F, broke into pieces, spreading the
   majority of the debris over an area of about 300 yards, said Robert
   Sumwalt of the NTSB. A photograph provided by city officials shows the
   crumpled front portion of the plane resting in a debris-strewn field.

   The plane, which took off from Louisville, Kentucky, went down around
   4:45 a.m. on a street that runs parallel to the
   Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, Mayor William Bell
   said.

   The location is about a half-mile north of the runway, FAA spokeswoman
   Kathleen Bergen told CNN.

   NTSB investigators have yet to retrieve the cockpit and voice recorders
   of the plane because the wreckage is still smoldering, Sumwalt said.
   Once the fire is out, authorities will retrieve the recorders, he said.

   Even so, investigators have begun working to piece together what led to
   the crash.

   The crew did not issue a distress call, Sumwalt said, confirming what
   the mayor said earlier.

   The crew did not report any trouble, Bell said, citing conversations
   with control tower officials. Light showers and a visibility of 10
   miles were reported in the area of the airport at the time of the
   crash, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen.

   A spokesman for Bell, the mayor, confirmed late Wednesday morning that
   no buildings were hit and no one on the ground was injured.

   [42]Five facts to calm plane crash fears

   Alabama Power cut electricity to about 140 buildings near the crash
   site as a precaution, utility spokesman Michael Sznajderman told CNN.

   Witness Peter Torres, a Civil Air Patrol member who said he is a former
   airline mechanic, said he thought he heard what sounded like a backfire
   from the jet's engines as the plane passed overhead. He rushed to his
   window.

   "I saw the flash," of an apparent explosion, he said, followed by a
   "boom" that shook his home.

   Airport neighbor Sharon Wilson told WBRC the plane seemed lower than
   usual for flights into the airport and sounded like it was sputtering
   as it flew overhead.

   "We heard this loud boom, like, jump up out of your bed," she told the
   station.

   The plane was one of two flights UPS sends to Birmingham each day,
   [43]company spokesman Mike Mangeot told CNN affiliate WBRC.

   "This incident is very unfortunate, and our thoughts and prayers are
   with those involved," UPS Airlines President Mitch Nichols said in a
   statement.

   The plane that crashed Wednesday was built in 2003 and had 11,000 hours
   in the air spread over 6,800 flights, Airbus said in a news release.

   Only UPS and FedEx fly the A300 in the United States, according to its
   manufacturer, Airbus. While it was once used for commercial passenger
   flights in the United States, the plane is now used only for cargo
   flights. UPS has 53 of the planes, according to Airbus.

   Wednesday's crash is the second involving an A300 in the United States.
   In 2001, an American Airlines A300 crashed in the Belle Harbor
   neighborhood of Queens, in New York City, shortly after takeoff from
   John F. Kennedy International Airport.

   All 260 people on board the plane, as well as five people on the
   ground, were killed.

   The cause was ultimately attributed to pilot error, according to the
   NTSB, which said the first officer put excessive pressure on the rudder
   pedal, causing the separation of the vertical stabilizer.

   The Birmingham crash is the second fatal accident involving a large jet
   in the United States since early July, when an [44]Asiana Airlines
   Boeing 777 crashed on landing at San Francisco International Airport.
   Three people died.

   Wednesday's crash comes nearly three years after UPS's last major
   incident, the crash of a Boeing 747 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates,
   that killed two crew members.

   Investigators traced the crash to a large fire in the cargo hold, which
   included a number of flammable lithium batteries, according to the
   country's General Civil Aviation Authority.

   In 2006, a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 flown by UPS caught fire after
   landing at Philadelphia International Airport. Three crew members on
   the plane evacuated with minor injuries, according to NTSB records.
   Most of the cargo was destroyed.

   CNN's David Mattingly reported from Birmingham, with Michael Pearson
   and Chelsea J. Carter writing in Atlanta. CNN's Marlena Baldacci, Aaron
   Cooper, Mike Ahlers and Stephanie Gallman also contributed to this
   report.
