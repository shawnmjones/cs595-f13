   Tonight, we're liveblogging the results of the special Democratic
   primary in Illinois's 2nd Congressional District, which is currently
   vacant due to ex-Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr.'s resignation last year. The
   [30]16-candidate field is led by ex-state Rep. Robin Kelly. Other
   notable candidates include ex-Rep. Debbie Halvorson, Chicago Alderman
   Anthony Beale, health care administrator Joyce Washington, and ex-Rep.
   Mel Reynolds. [31]Click here for our preview of tonight's action.

   District Results: [32]AP (summary) o [33]AP (by county)

   County Results: [34]Cook (Chicago) o [35]Cook (Suburbs) o [36]Kankakee
   o [37]Will
     __________________________________________________________________

   [38]5:24 PM PT (jeffmd): The city of Chicago's now 24 percent
   reporting, and Robin Kelly has a huge lead with 56%. 9th Ward Alderman
   Anthony Beale is in 2nd with 18, and Debbie Halvorson's in 3rd with 14.

   [39]5:29 PM PT (jeffmd): Suburban Cook County is also reporting now
   some votes now, about 10% reporting. Kelly is also doing well there, at
   57%. Halvorson's in second there at 23 and Beale in 3rd at 8. This
   one's over, folks.

   [40]5:35 PM PT (jeffmd): Well, there's one Will County precinct
   reporting, where Halvorson is commanding with 84% to Kelly's 14%. (The
   raw margin itself, though is only 80 votes. Kelly's margin from the
   city itself is 1,640.)

   [41]5:37 PM PT (jeffmd): And for every one of Debbie's precincts, Kelly
   responds with more precincts from the city. The latest add (14% of
   precincts) boosts Kelly to 58% in the city (and a 2,994-vote margin
   over Halvorson).

   [42]5:39 PM PT (jeffmd): Suburban Cook is rolling in now too, with 38%
   reporting there. Kelly's holding steady at 57% there, good for a
   4,054-vote margin. More precincts in Will County have reported too,
   where Halvorson's margin has closed to a more reasonable 62-29.

   [43]5:43 PM PT (jeffmd): More precincts from suburban Cook, bringing
   the district to 51.5% reporting. Kelly's holding on to her commanding
   lead at 58%. (Halvorson's at 18%, Beale at 10%). Nothing yet from
   Kankakee, but it won't matter; Debbie's trailing by 11,000 votes at
   this point.

   [44]5:47 PM PT (jeffmd): Another update from the city of Chicago and
   Will County, bringing the district to 58% reporting. Same story - Kelly
   57, Halvorson 18, Beale 10. Notably, the more recent Will precincts
   have been better for Kelly than the early ones; she's up to 34% there
   now.

   [45]5:56 PM PT (jeffmd): Kankakee has started to report now. While
   Halvorson's commanding a solid 84-13 margin there, the votes cast there
   are also minimal. Kelly's lead stands at a solid 13,538 votes.

   [46]6:01 PM PT (jeffmd): 61% reporting now, with almost all of Will
   County reporting. That claws Halvorson up to 22, but Kelly's still in
   commanding position at 55. (Beale at 10.)

   [47]6:07 PM PT (jeffmd): And this is the remix to ignition: [48]the
   AP's put a checkmark next to "R. Kelly". With good reason too -- a
   simple projection would have Kelly finishing with 53%.

   [49]6:15 PM PT (jeffmd): The precincts keep rolling in, with 67%
   reporting now. Kelly's at 54, with Halvorson at 23 and Beale at 10.
   This doesn't look like it'll change much...we're projecting that this
   will end up 53-23-10 or so.

   [50]6:23 PM PT (jeffmd): 72% reporting now, and it's still 53 Kelly-23
   Halvorson-10 Beale.

   This [51]map of Will County is really telling. Outside of Monee
   township (which has a large Black population), Debbie is walking away
   with the county, racking up upwards of 80-85% in the more rural
   townships (and her home base of Crete).

   [52]6:36 PM PT (jeffmd): A few more notes: did Halvorson's crossover
   voting strategy have some effect? Possibly! It's looking like Will and
   Kankakee County will each make up 8% of the vote tonight, up from 5-6%
   in the 2012 primary. Of course, the 2012 primary had a competitive
   Presidential race on the Republican side, so this may be more of the
   natural balance in the district.

   Also, while turnout was low, when all is said in done, it won't be that
   low -- there'll be about 58,000 votes cast district-wide. In the 2009
   special primary won by now IL-05 Rep. Mike Quigley to replace Rahm
   Emanuel, about 60,000 votes were cast. The old IL-05 was about 10% less
   Democratic than this incarnation of IL-02, though.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [68]Civil
   Rights, [69]Community, [70]Congress, [71]Culture, [72]Economy,
   [73]Education, [74]Elections, [75]Energy, [76]Environment, [77]Health
   Care, [78]International, [79]Labor, [80]Law, [81]Media, [82]Meta,
   [83]National Security, [84]Science, [85]Transportation, or [86]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([87]California, [88]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       On Election night 2010, Cook reported so quickly that Pat Quinn
       jumped out to a massive lead early in the night. No one thought it
       would hold...but then, it did, amazingly.
       ...which is how we got civil unions (and possibly full marriage
       equality soon) and a very Dem-friendly congressional map.

   one thing that may boost turnout in the Cook section of the district
   are elections in Calumet City. So i'd imagine there'd be some "get
   people to vote" activity there independent of the Congressional race.
   And i'd imagine it'd probably go for Kelly

       legitimately just one option on the ballot for one race and I don't
       like it is an abdication of my Democratic responsibility. I think
       it's important to show dissent even when there isn't an actual
       option to do so on the ballot, and I might as well have fun while
       doing it.

       BeloitDem is well aware of the privilege and responsibility that
       voting is, and the seriousness of the democratic process.  Protest
       voting, when used in the right circumstances, is entirely
       compatible with that viewpoint.

     Poll Shows Debbie Halvorson Leading in 2nd District

     According to a poll conducted for WCKG radio, in the poll of 500
     voters, Halvorson had 21 percent while former state Rep. Robin Kelly
     had 17 percent -- within the margin of error.

     "The results of this latest poll confirms what other polls --
     outside the Robin Kelly campaign -- have indicated," Halvorson said
     in a statement, that she's in the lead.

     Pollster Rod McCulloch told The Daily Journal that negative ads paid
     for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's Independence USA PAC "may
     have backfired."

     ...conservative, pro-gun voters in Will and Kankakee counties may
     have taken the ads as an endorsement of Halvorson, and may be
     willing to cross over to the Democratic primary

       4. Got caught on tape by police talking to his teenage girlfriend
       about a (made-up) fifteen year old girl that she invented to entrap
       him. His comments included his response to her offer of a three-way
       ("Did I win the lotto?") and the subject of the fifteen-year old's
       age ("You may not want to tell her that, that age thing. That would
       screw me.").
       5. Also convicted a year after the rape conviction of lying to
       defraud banks and diverting campaign funds into his personal
       account. Got threatened with further prosecution when he mouthed
       "you son of a bitch" at one of the witnesses.

       In [1004]silver spring's Maryland redistricting diary, one of many
       that were made in 2011.  Like others, it puts right-wing Carroll
       County into the Baltimore City district of Elijah Cummings, though
       numerically the latter outnumbers the former in population and
       influence, and the district remains safely blue.
       It starts pretty quickly as the third comment below the tip jar, as
       ConcernedCitizenYouBet claims that Carroll County will:

     They will outspend the black areas of your proposed district seven
     five to one to avoid being represented by a black man or women.
     Plus, they all vote.  Trust me, I live in this area of the state.
       andgarden, twohundertseventy, silver spring, and okiedem offer
       various responses touching on how even 80% McCain voters are
       outmatched by 95% Obama voters, how the district is still quite
       African-American, how some conservative areas are already in the
       district, and other well-reasoned responses.
       ConcernedCitizenYouBet responds with:

     I think that you are missing the big picture.  The white Marylanders
     who live in Southern Carroll County and Western Howard refer to
     Baltimore as "N-----ville".  There is extreme prejudice in this area
     of Central Maryland.  African Americans do not loiter in Southern
     Carroll or Western Howard, as they are not welcome.  Folding
     Southern Carroll into Cummings District is going to cause a tipping
     point to occur in Maryland politics, and the result is not going to
     be pretty.  We are talking about serious white backlash.  These
     people are not above joining the Democratic Party in order to change
     the power structure from within.
       To which NMLib replies:

     These must be some very dedicated racists if they'd really, en mass,
     join the Democratic Party just to vote out the black dude, I mean
     really, that's almost comical.

     Of course, let's assume that these guys are really that dedicated,
     so what? They'll still be outnumbered (by quite a bit) in a
     Democratic primary, so even then it doesn't matter what the hell the
     comically dedicated racists of southern Carroll county and western
     Howard actually do.

       I did some reading, and [1205]apparently Illinois has strict
       recount procedures.
       If the losing candidate gets 95% the votes of the winner (which
       will probably happen here...the two of them at 462 and 444 votes
       respectively at the moment), they can request a partial recount to
       "review voting operations", and if they find evidence of
       impropriety, they can bring it before the IL Supreme Court (the
       only body capable of ordering a full recount).
       So yeah, I doubt the 2nd place dude even bothers.

       He's a creature of Wall Street. Just because you're a single-issue

       a vehement supporter of the Iraq War until it became politically

       (and the ad campaign) favored Kelly.  But (a) it was a low-turnout
       special election where a good ground game could make a big
       difference, and (b) Robin is winning this by 30 points where the
       two polls I saw had Kelly by 10 in one, and Halvorson by 4 in the
       other.
       I think getting an outright majority in an eighteen-candidate race,
       and the margin-of-victory is an encouraging takeaway from this
       result.

 Recount rules ([1569]0+ / 0-)
       [1570]are very tough in Illinois.
       Basically, anyone who gets within 5% or so of winning can request a
       partial review of election operations, and if they find something
       wrong, they can submit that as evidence in a case to the IL Supreme
       Court.  The IL SC then decides whether to authorize a full recount
       or not.  Sounds like it takes a lot of time, effort, and money, and
       there's no guarantee the court will even grant a recount unless
       there is evidence of serious irregularities.
       I doubt the GOP loser will bother, even if it ends up being a 1
       vote difference.  Not really any point to it, Kelly would crush
       them by fifty points afterwards.

 So something to consider... ([1722]0+ / 0-)

   Halvorson ended up only getting 24% of the vote, that actually means
   that even if Hutchinson had stayed in the race, she still would have
   ended up losing, even if Hutchinson and Kelly had split there votes
   50/50 and Halvorson had kept all of her support.

   Halvorson's problem always was that her base was in a place that has
   very little influence in the district, and the more she kept trying to
   appeal to them (and maybe try to get some Republicans to crossover to
   vote for her) the more she alienated the Democratic core in Cook
   County, which lowered her ceiling.
