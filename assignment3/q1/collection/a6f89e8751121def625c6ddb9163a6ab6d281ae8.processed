   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [45]Tagging tips - [46]Search For Tags - [47]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   The Rs will obstruct everything but appointments in the House--what a
   stupid time to change the rules in the Senate.  There will come a time
   when the sane ones will be in the minority in the House and Senate--and
   will need to filibuster.  If timing is everything, we missed the boat.

   Apres Bush, le deluge.

   majority control of the senate we could kill the filibuster!

     But at least it helped the dems stop bush's right wing SC nominees,
     eh?

     At least it stopped the odious Patriot Act eh?

     At least it stopped the Iraqi debacle, eh?

     At least it stopped retroactive immunity for telecomms, eh?

     At least it stopped Free Trade Job Outsourcing, eh?

   Oh wait.  It did none of those things, did it?

   But it sure as hell stopped the Public Option, didn't it?

   If I didn't know better, I'd think this were a Kabuki Play.

   The excuses for Obama's behavior have long since passed the point of
   predictability neccessary to qualify as an absurd production of Kabuki
   Theater.

 Milquetoast Harry doesn't want effective reform ([129]1+ / 0-)

       Then inaction would be laid at his feet.
       The "painless" filibuster is anything but.  With Republicans'
       majority in the House, it gives them control of both the house and
       Senate.  Imagine if they carry through to change the way electoral
       votes are allocated in swing states and a Republican is elected in
       2016.  Total control of the Federal government from a minority of
       votes.
       Even Democrats can be asses. Look at Rahm Emanuel.

 Filibuster (d. 1975); Cloture Vote (1975-) ([134]0+ / 0-)

   I'll tip the jar, though I humbly beg to differ on the message.

   In truth, the filibuster has not existed since the Senate changed its
   rules in 1975, giving birth to the lazier & politically-cheaper cloture
   vote in its place -- & eventually setting the stage for the modern era
   in which Democrats have to whip 60 votes to go to the lavatory.

   The problem with the Senate lies more in the ease of obstruction rather
   than obstruction in itself. Many of us at Daily Kos & elsewhere can
   remember numerous bills -- many backed by "bipartisan coalitions", in
   fact -- which absolutely deserved to be publically blocked because they
   contained horrid, un-American give-aways to 1%er lobbyists at our
   expense (SOPA/PIPA, anyone?) -- & would have sailed right through on a
   simple majority vote. After all, we're human beings, not hamsters; we
   can see clearly that DC is not necessarily making forward progress just
   because its wheels keep turning.

   I argue, then, that we need the filibuster back -- specifically, the
   pre-1975 requirement that a Senator hold the floor, bar the door, &
   stop all business until he either yields the podium or gets voted back
   into his seat by 60 of his colleagues (or collapses onto the floor from
   exhaustion -- shouts of "Hallelujah" being entirely optional).

   Remember Savita Halappanavar!
