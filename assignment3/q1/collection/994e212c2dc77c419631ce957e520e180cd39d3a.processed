Texas first responder to plead not guilty to pipe bomb charge

   From David Mattingly, CNN
   updated 12:24 PM EDT, Sun May 12, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Lawyer denies "speculation" that Bryce Reed was involved in
       the explosion
     * Authorities announced Friday the launch of a criminal investigation
       into the blast
     * They have not said whether Reed's arrest is connected
     * Reed will enter his plea on Wednesday

   (CNN) -- An emergency responder to last month's deadly Texas fertilizer
   plant explosion will plead not guilty to the charge of having possessed
   materials for a pipe bomb, his lawyer said Saturday.

   Bryce Reed will enter that plea on Wednesday at a federal court
   hearing, lawyer Jonathan Sibley said.

   "We have not been able to obtain specific information about the extent
   of the allegations, but Mr. Reed anxiously awaits his day in court and
   his opportunity to address these allegations," Sibley said in a
   statement.

   Authorities said Friday they were launching a criminal investigation
   into last month's blast in the town of West, but have not said whether
   Reed's arrest is connected.

   Local sheriff's deputies were called on Tuesday to a residence where
   they found components for a pipe bomb, according to a criminal
   complaint affidavit.

   The officers determined that Reed had given the materials to the
   resident of that home last month, the complaint says.

   Among the materials found were a galvanized metal pipe, a fuse, coils
   of metal ribbon and several bags of chemical powders, it adds.

   Reed, who was arrested early Friday, is charged with possession of a
   destructive device.

   "At this time authorities will not speculate whether the possession of
   the unregistered destructive device has any connection to the West
   fertilizer plant explosion," the U.S. attorney's office for the Western
   District of Texas said in a release.

   But Sibley addressed "speculation" that the allegation was related to
   the April 17 incident, which killed 14 in the town of West. "Let me be
   very clear," the defense lawyer said in the statement. "Mr. Reed had no
   involvement whatsoever in the explosion at the West, Texas fertilizer
   plant."

   Reed himself lost friends and family in the disaster "and remains
   resolute in his desire to assist in the rebuilding of his community,"
   Sibley said, cautioning against any rush to judgment.

   If convicted, Reed would face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000
   fine.

   Reed spoke last month at a memorial for the victims at Baylor
   University.

   The arrest details came as authorities said they were conducting a
   criminal investigation into the fire and explosion.

   "This disaster has severely impacted the community of West, and we want
   to ensure that no stone goes unturned and that all the facts related to
   this incident are uncovered," DPS Director Steven McCraw said.

   On Monday, the state fire marshal's office said it had ruled out
   weather, other natural causes, anhydrous ammonium and ammonium nitrate
   in a rail car as possible causes.

   The fire began in the fertilizer and seed building; the blast happened
   about 20 minutes after the first report of a fire at the fertilizer
   facility. It registered on seismographs as a magnitude-2.1 earthquake
   and could be felt 50 miles away.

   The explosion damaged numerous homes, a nursing home and the town's
   high school and middle school, all of which had been built within a few
   hundred feet of the plant. West is about 70 miles south-southwest of
   Dallas.

   At least 60 investigators have been on site each day and have conducted
   411 interviews in trying to determine how the fire started and what
   caused the explosion.

   West Fertilizer Co., which operated the facility, had been cited by
   federal regulators twice since 2006.

   In 2012, the Transportation Department's Pipeline and Hazardous
   Materials Safety Administration fined West Fertilizer $5,250 for
   storing anhydrous ammonia in tanks that lacked the proper warning
   labels. The agency had originally recommended a $10,000 penalty, but
   reduced it after the company took corrective action.

   In 2006, the EPA fined the company $2,300 and told the owners to
   correct problems that included a failure to file a risk management
   program plan on time.

   That same year, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
   investigated a complaint that the area around the plant smelled of
   ammonia.
