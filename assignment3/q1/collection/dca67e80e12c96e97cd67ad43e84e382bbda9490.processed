Kittens risk all nine lives in subway caper

   New York (CNN) -- Lions may be kings of the jungle, but for nearly two
   hours, two kittens ruled the concrete jungle as officials halted New
   York subway service Thursday.

   The fearless felines risked all nine lives meandering the subway
   Thursday, causing part of it to be shut down for 90 minutes as
   personnel cut the power to begin their search.

   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority suspended subway service on
   the B and Q lines between the Kings Highway and DeKalb Avenue stops in
   Brooklyn -- about 6 miles of track -- to search for two cats that were
   reported seen at about 11 a.m., MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said.
   And the Golden Kitty goes to ...

   MTA had to cut the power to the third rail, which carries 600 volts of
   electricity.

   "If you touch that third rail, you're not going to make it -- people
   and especially cats, anything that moves," Ortiz said.

   New Yorkers are accustomed to seeing critters, but it's usually rats
   and mice scampering around the underground tunnels, leaving the alley
   cats above ground.

   Even though the search was for a couple of friendly felines, some
   riders were not happy with the inconvenient suspension.

   "It's a waste of money. They could have been doing something else. It's
   a waste of money. But that's the MTA for you," subway rider and former
   MTA employee Wilson Burton told [41]CNN affiliate WABC.

   The New York Police Department was brought to the scene later in the
   day for crowd control.

   "As the trains backed up, the crowds build up and people are late in
   their travels. We have to make sure everyone gets to their place
   safely," Lt. Paul Ng of the NYPD said.

   Though the sneaky cats were at large on the tracks for more than seven
   hours, they reappeared around 6 p.m. and were corralled and captured
   within the half hour, MTA spokeswoman Judie Glave said. They were taken
   to a nearby shelter, police said.

   It is MTA protocol for conductors to stop and call in anytime something
   is on or traveling on the tracks, so it is in the best interest of
   customers and MTA to clear the track as soon as possible, Glave said.

   The pair was found in the same spot where they were first sighted
   earlier in the day, despite the running trains and the re-electrified
   deadly third rail.

   It was a close call -- but, luckily, curiosity didn't kill these cats.
