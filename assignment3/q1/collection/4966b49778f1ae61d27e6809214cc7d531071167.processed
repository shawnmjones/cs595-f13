Top U.S. intel official challenges reports that spy agencies mined Internet
data

   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Director of national intelligence says the reports have
       "numerous inaccuracies"
     * NEW: He stresses that, per the law, U.S. citizens and people in
       U.S. can't be targeted

   (CNN) -- America's top intelligence official on Thursday night
   challenged news reports claiming Facebook posts, Gmail messages and
   more have been intercepted for years in a vast data-mining operation,
   saying the reports "contain numerous inaccuracies."

   The [41]Guardian, a British newspaper, and the[42] Washington Post
   reported Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies had access to the
   central servers of nine of the country's biggest technology firms
   including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook.

   The Post reported the program -- called PRISM -- underwent "exponential
   growth" since its founding in 2007. In fact, the newspaper said the
   program has become the leading source of raw material for the National
   Security Agency, the secretive U.S. intelligence operation that
   monitors electronic communications.
   U.S. intelligence agencies operated a broad data-mining program that
   extracted e-mail, photos and other private communications from some of
   the biggest Internet companies, The Guardian and The Washington Post

   Yet several tech giants whose servers were reportedly ensnared in the
   program denied any knowledge of it Thursday.

   And James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, questioned
   the Guardian and Post articles in a statement Thursday night.

   He referred to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
   Act, which he noted was recently reauthorized by Congress -- one of the
   bodies, along with the executive branch and Foreign Intelligence
   Surveillance Court, with oversight over aspects of intelligence
   gathering.

   Section 702, Clapper added, "is designed to facilitate the acquisition
   of foreign intelligence information concerning non-U.S. persons located
   outside the United States."

   "It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other
   U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States," he said in
   his statement.

   While he made no mention of data mining, Clapper did defend the
   American intelligence effort generally, saying, "Information collected
   under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign
   intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation
   from a wide variety of threats."

   Clapper also called out the person or people behind "the unauthorized
   disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal
   program," saying such apparent leaks are "reprehensible and risks
   important protections for the security of Americans."

   The Post reported that its reporters had been provided a detailed
   briefing presentation document on the PRISM program.

   The program has been running since 2007 and has undergone "exponential
   growth" since then, the Post reported. It is now the leading source of
   raw material for the National Security Agency, the secretive U.S.
   intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications.

   According to a briefing slide published by the Guardian, PRISM began
   with data from Microsoft in 2007. The program began collecting data
   from Yahoo in 2008 and from Google, Facebook and the message system
   PalTalk in 2009. YouTube became a source in 2010, Skype and AOL in 2011
   and Apple in late 2012, the slide claims.

   The NSA declined to comment, but several companies -- many of them
   using similar language -- denied Thursday any knowledge of such a
   program.

   Microsoft, for instance, said in a statement it only provides user data
   when legally required and for specific accounts -- adding that "if the
   government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather
   customer data we don't participate in it."

   Jodi Seth, a spokeswoman for Facebook, said the social media giant
   works to "carefully scrutinize any ... request for compliance" and does
   not give government agencies "direct access" to its servers.

   Apple spokesman Steve Dowling offered a similar response -- saying
   Apple hands over information only when a government agency gets a court
   order. Dowling added that his company has never heard of PRISM.

   "We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we
   review all such requests carefully," a Google spokesman said in
   response to the stories. "From time to time, people allege that we have
   created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not
   have a 'back door' for the government to access private user data."

   Even with these denials and Clapper's defense, President Barack Obama's
   administration has come under growing scrutiny in recent days over his
   record on balancing citizens' right to privacy and the government's
   efforts to combat terrorism.

   [43]Patriot Act at center of Verizon phone log controversy

   That includes news, first reported on Wednesday by the Guardian and
   commented on by U.S. politicians, that the FBI and National Security
   Agency have been [44]collecting the phone records of millions of
   Americans -- specifically Verizon customers and perhaps others -- over
   a several year period.

   Days after taking office [45]in 2009, Obama vowed, "Transparency and
   the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency." But on
   Thursday, the left-leaning Huffington Post conflated Obama with his
   predecessor George W. Bush while a New York Times editorial said "the
   administration has now lost all credibility" when it comes to
   overreaching in the name of fighting terrorism.

   "Mr. Obama is proving the truism that the executive branch will use any
   power it is given and very likely abuse it," the Times' editorial said.

   [46]What does the Verizon order mean for me?
