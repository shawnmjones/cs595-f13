If Huckabee is the RNC's model spokesperson...

   It was briefly encouraging a week ago when RNC Chairman Reince Priebus
   was offered a chance to condemn Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) over marriage
   equality, but passed. Referencing his party's possible appeal to LGBT
   voters, Priebus said, "I think Sen. Portman made some pretty big
   inroads.... I think it's about being decent. I think it's about dignity
   and respect, that nobody deserves to have their dignity diminished, or
   people don't deserve to be disrespected."

   It wasn't exactly a progressive position, but for an RNC chair, it
   wasn't bad, either.

   The relief [3]did not last.

     ...Priebus says his support of Portman doesn't signal a policy shift
     within the party's platform. "Yes, we're still a pro-life party.
     Yes, we still defend our platform on marriage," he said. He
     emphasized, however, that Republicans must also sound "reasonable"
     to voters who disagree.

     Priebus cited former governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas as an
     example of someone who could be "a model for a lot of people in our
     party" in terms of discussing issues like marriage and abortion. "I
     always tell people: Listen to Governor Mike Huckabee," he said. "I
     don't know anyone that talks about them any better."

   Is that so.

   OK, let's take Reince Priebus' advice and "listen to" Mike Huckabee on
   culture-war issues. We might hear, for example, the former Arkansas
   governor suggest a [4]national quarantine for those who are HIV
   positive. Huckabee has also [5]equated homosexuality with '"pedophilia,
   sadomasochism, and necrophilia," and compared gay marriage [6]to drug
   addiction.

   Huckabee has also compared legal abortion to [7]slavery and the [8]Nazi
   holocaust.

   The chairman of the RNC doesn't know "anyone" who talks about these
   social issues "better" than Huckabee? Either Priebus needs to get out
   more or his party's rebranding campaign is very likely to struggle.

   Huckabee is a radio jock now, trying to steal Limpballs audience.
   Perhaps a better example of a "reasonable" Republican exists...

   This is as good a time as any to remind people that Mike Huckabee is
   also an ordained, Southern Baptist Minister.

   So this guy is a man of God? Kind of makes your head spin, doesn't it?

   One of the main problems of religion these days is that nearly all
   religions, Christian, Muslim at least, have become so hung up on rules
   and doctrine that they have lost the central drama of salvation through
   grace and love. And of course they do not recognize what science is
   revealing about the true nature of things, i.e. that existance is a
   form of community. They assume that "survival of the fitest" means that
   the toughest, meanest, biggest jock on the block is the one that will
   survive. If that were the case, why is it that all the major preditors
   on the earth are on the engangered species list and Mankind, the
   ultimate social animal is the dominate species. If we end up destroying
   ourselves it will not be because we did too much community service; it
   will be because we failed to be human and civil enough -- we failed to
   work together and to include everyone.

   It is a misnomer to call it "the survival of the fittest". It should
   read, "the survival of the "most adaptable'.

   If we keep abusing our planet, that might be cockroaches and Wayne La

   "Reasonable Republican" is a logical contradiction that asks matter and
   anti-matter to co-exist without an explosion. It violates the basic
   laws of the universe.

   And "Mankind, the ultimate social animal" has been from the minute it
   dropped from the trees, the major predator on the planet. Look at the
   number of species that got wiped out when we were still armed with
   stone axes and clubs - mammoth, sabre-tooth tiger, etc., etc. And now
   we're just a cancer on the planet as a species.

   TC: I grant that Mankind has done a lot of damage to the planet and is
   likely to do more, but it is not because we were the best predators; we
   did not start becoming dominant until we became first herders and then
   farmers. If we fail, it will be because we fail to live by the basic
   rules of life: know thy self, thy place in the scheme of things which
   means recognizing that not only are we dependent on one another but on
   the entire fabric of life for our survival.

   We are going to have to see the true hero as a type of Christ, the
   suffering servant and the anti-hero/ the anti-Christ as the selfish,
   greedy, bastard who wants to possess all for himself. That is what make
   Huckabee such a dangerous hypocrite: he is in the tradition of Satan
   even though he is an ordained minister in a Christian church.

   I thought bees and ants were the ultimate social animals.

   And predators are always endangered and "rare" because there must be a
   lot more prey than predator.

   Repugs are predators....out to kill just about anything. The prey
   however are adapting fast and the predators are becoming endangered.

   This shifting weather patterns by the affects of Global Warming should
   be interesting, when you think about the growing season and crop
   failures that could happen. How much is this going to affect our food
   supply, especially if we get any droughts this year a long with these
   extended winter conditions. The earth travels around the sun the same
   as it always has done and an overall shift in weather patterns that
   drastically affects our growing season could have major implications in
   the world. And than on top of it, some major severe weather that will
   be occurring that is not a good-looking scenario. The rich bastards can
   squawk all they want on trying to make it look like they are really
   doing something, but it is always the little guy who has to fix the
   crap rich bastards, Republicans, and false Pharisees created that had
   no concern for others.

   Huck also wanted to add extra lines to I 95 as a non-outsource-able
   jobs program. And while the born again baptist stuff gets in the way of
   seeing him as anything but a holy roller Grinch, he had something
   there. It would have been a modern CCC.

   It's probably true. Huckabee generally comes across as a nice, likable
   guy- your grand-father or uncle who's fun to hang out with as long as
   you don't bring up politics. When politics comes up, though, you just
   nod your head and grin to get through it without starting a fight. The
   truth is it doesn't matter how nice you are- if you're supporting such
   unpopular ideas, you're going to flounder. The RNC can't get past the
   idea of rebranding, because they can't admit their problems are
   fundamental- people don't support their ideas.

   Exactly. The rebranding is a sideshow, because it's based on the
   ongoing Republican delusion that their policy positions aren't
   unpopular, they're just talking about them wrong.

   It is pretty funny, though.

   The Histroy Channel should have made their Satan look a little more
   like Huckabee, because Huckabee bears a much closer resemblence to
   Satan than Obama. Satan is the enemy of God, who is love and truth.
   Look at all the great literary depictions of Satan and evil and you
   will see a character consumed with envy, hatred, low self-esteem, and

   huckabee has a history or shooting off his mouth a lot more times than
   mentioned. he once said that environmentalists were crypto-abortionists
   (wrap your head around that one), and opined that insurance companies
   had an inalienable right to discriminate against those with
   pre-existing conditions. huck has no sense of justice or equity, but he
   damn sure understands a dollar. after a mass shooting incident in
   arkansas by two teenagers, he collected up a wad of his old sermons and
   peddled them in a book called, 'when kids kill'.

   Yes, a lovely guy in the upper Florida Keys. When we progressives look
   at evangelical Christians we are confronted with a baby and bath water
   situation which ought to give us more pause than it tends to do. We
   tend to only comment on the latter, on the institutions and leaders who
   are hate-mongering hypocrites, and don't mention that, very often,
   perhaps most often, evangelical parishioners are lovely people who care
   about each other and their community and from what I've seen in the
   cases of things I don't think of as anything to do with sin (but they
   do), able to distinguish between the sin and the sinner and behave in
   quite a loving fashion toward the latter.

   Head Priest Priebus of the New Order of the False God has confused the
   verb tenses. Not surprising as the language has evolved since the

   conditional "could be" he should have used the simple declarative "is"
   as in "Huckabee's faux religious fervor IS a model of everything that

   pro-choice, because you can't make that decision for anyone else. You

   The Republican Party, seen as a single entity, has a crucial
   contradiction in it's quasi-totalitarian ideology Progressives and
   Liberals should take full advantage of in a move to completely divide
   it: One wing has politicized religion to the point that some will vote
   for a "Christian", no matter how corrupt, simply because he claims that
   mantle. The other wing could properly be called the uber-Capitalist
   wing that has managed to conflate Capitalism with Democracy. They're
   not the same and have been very uneasy bedfellows for over 100 years.
   The contradiction is personified by Paul Ryan, a dippy Representative
   who believes it's possible to be both Catholic and an Ayn Rand groupie.

   Pit the selflessness-as-a-value against the selfishness-as-a-value and
   you've got a civil war the Republican Party won't ever reunite.
