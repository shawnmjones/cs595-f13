Democratic Lawmakers Seek To Repeal N.H. Voter ID Law

   A group of Democratic lawmakers want to repeal the voter ID
   requirements implemented under Republican leadership.

   Current law requires that voters be asked for photo identification at
   the polls, but does not require they have one to cast a ballot.

   In elections this year, people who wanted to vote but did not have ID
   had to sign an affidavit.

   Proponents argue the measure helps to prevent voter fraud, but Tim
   Horrigan, a Durham Democrat, says there is no evidence that a problem
   exists.

   "There's this whole theory about voter impersonation. I understand why
   it'd be bad if people were going around impersonating voters, but it's
   simply not happening."

   The bill stands a good chance of making it through the new Democratic
   majority in the House.

   And a spokesman for Governor-elect Maggie Hassan says she believes the
   voter ID requirements were quote-misguided.

   The biggest hurdle will likely be in the Republican-led Senate, but
   Horrigan says he is confident he can get the votes needed to repeal the
   law.
