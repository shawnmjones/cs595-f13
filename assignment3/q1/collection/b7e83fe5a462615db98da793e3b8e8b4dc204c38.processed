   Our vision for education is that all students have access to what they
   need, when they need it. For some this will mean accelerating beyond
   the fixed pace of today‚s classroom. For others it will mean being
   given opportunities for extended practice of skills or content they
   have yet to master. For all students, it will mean learning experiences
   that are tailored specifically to their progress against a clear set of
   academic standards; receiving constant, actionable information on their
   progress; and experiencing the deep, one-on-one engagement with their
   teacher and other students that is often missing from today‚s
   classrooms. We and many others call this vision personalized learning.

   We believe that adaptive digital learning tools, or ‚courseware,‚ can
   extend the reach of teachers to make personalized learning possible,
   particularly for students who are underserved by the current education
   system. Leading mathematics courseware products have already produced
   strong evidence that this is possible.

   We also believe that mastery of literacy skills is critical to
   students‚ long-term success. However, despite growing acknowledgement
   of the importance of literacy and decades of reform efforts, U.S.
   students‚ literacy skills have barely improved over the past forty
   years and are failing to keep up with the growth of other nations.
   Currently, a third of U.S. 8th graders are proficient in reading and
   writing. This has to change for our students to be prepared for 21st
   century college and careers.

   The goal of this Challenge is to stimulate development of courseware
   supporting literacy instruction.

   The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is investing $6 million in
   web-based courseware to support students in mastering the Common Core
   State Standards for literacy at the 4th-8th grade levels. Our approach
   aims to entice publishers, developers, and entrepreneurs to propose the
   most innovative digital solutions for engaging, personalized software
   that helps students with reading and writing. Through an RFP process,
   we awarded 29 grants in amounts of $25,000-$500,000.

   Recipients of awards in the amount of $100,000-$500,000 will have the
   opportunity to pilot their products in order to participate in an
   independent evaluation of their product's impact on student learning
   and receive feedback they can use to refine their solutions.

   We invite you to explore the Challenge through the background
   information detailed in the [125]Literacy Courseware Challenge Request
   for Proposal (RFP).

   About the Foundation

   Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill and
   Melinda Gates Foundation aspires to help all people lead healthy,
   productive lives. We are dedicated to discovering and disseminating
   innovative approaches to addressing extreme poverty and poor health in
   developing countries and improving the U.S. education system. Because
   our financial resources, while siginificant, represent a small fraction
   of what‚s needed to address these challenges, we work in partnership
   with governments, the private sector, and other donors and
   organizations to achieve the greatest possible impact.
