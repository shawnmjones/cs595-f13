[68]Lawmakers demand more details about Benghazi from State

   Posted by
   [69]CNN's Paul Courson

   Washington (CNN) - House Republicans continued to demand answers
   Wednesday on the Benghazi attack, one day the House Oversight and
   Government Reform Committee issued a congressional [70]subpoena to
   current and former State Department officials over the issue.

   In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, 15 members of the
   House Foreign Affairs Committee demanded to know what actions were
   taken against four people Kerry had testified would face consequences
   for failing to protect Chris Stevens, the ambassador to Libya, and
   others at the U.S. mission in Benghazi,
   Stevens was among four Americans killed on September 11, 2012, in an
   attack later characterized as an organized assault by terrorists.

   Kerry, who testified before the House panel in April, had promised to
   weigh in on actions taken against those who were documented as allowing
   what lawmakers called "the grossly inadequate security at the
   diplomatic facility in Benghazi last year."

   "Now that over one month has passed since your testimony," the House
   lawmakers wrote, "we expect an immediate update on this process." The
   letter was signed by Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, the chairman of the
   committee, and 14 other Republicans.

   A State Department official said Kerry is "closely reviewing the status
   of the four individuals on administrative leave."

   "As someone who for 29 years in the Senate was regarded as a top
   investigator and champion of oversight, he believes deeply in
   Congress's role in foreign policy," the official continued. "He also
   believes he needs to understand the facts on these specific cases and
   he will be making a decision on these cases soon."

   Kerry this week has also been subpoenaed by another congressional panel
   in the Republican-led House. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, chairman
   of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is demanding
   additional documents as part of his investigation into the Obama
   administration's response to the Benghazi attack.

   Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Jennifer Psaki said Kerry had
   not responded to the subpoena, which carries a deadline of June 7. "We
   are taking stock of this recent subpoena and determining the next
   appropriate steps," she said at a briefing for reporters.

       here go these no governing repubs trying to get out of doing their
       jobs with this fake outrage over Benghazi again. where was this
       outrage when 12 embassies were blown up, and hundred of folks died
       under the bush administration. we've got only 1 embassy blown up
       under the Obama administration, and the repubs and their fake
       outraged start coming out the wood work. i will take one instead of
       12 any day since nothing on this planet is perfect, and all we can
       do is strive for the best out of the worst. these repubs have come
       up with every excuse in the book not to do the people's work, our
       country is falling apart at the seems and all these good for
       nothing repubs do is chase ghost all over the white house.

       Can somebody please set up hearings as to why a known car
       thief.illegal gun owner who used said gun to intimidate is not only
       a member of congress from CA but the head of an oversight
       committee.
       Is it because the repugs think he knows how to catch a thief or
       two? Not that there's anything else to be said about Benghazi but
       these thugs just can't help themselves. No JOBS but let's continue
       to waste taxpayers' money.

    8. Larry in Houston
       I hope the republicans will continue this all the way up to
       election day - we'll see how this "pans out" for them. It's sort of
       going to be like "rove math" They will finally figure out where
       they went wrong, and why -

       The midterm elections can't get hear fast enough. Issa continues to
       go on his witch hunt at the taxpayers expense. Mark my words we
       will not forget this come November 2014.

       We will never have the truth and in Clinton's own words what
       difference does it make.
       Tell that to the four families who murdered their loved ones that's
       who cares.
