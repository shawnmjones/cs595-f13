   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi
   have pledged $100 million to deliver vaccines to children in
   Afghanistan and Pakistan.

   Each are donating $50 million to help treat children with five deadly
   diseases, as well as pneumonia. A third of the funds will be used to
   get the polio vaccine to as many as 35 million children. Jon Snow
   interviewed Bill and Melinda Gates, who are at the World Economic Forum
   in Davos, live earlier today. Follow the blog reaction and watch the
   video above.

Jon Snow writes on interviewing Bill and Melinda Gates:
Either the richest or second richest man in the world, you don't easily turn dow
n an interview with Bill Gates.
When you manage to secure an interview with both Bill, and Melinda gates, it's c
learly quite a moment. Whatever your feelings about wealth and riches, Earth has
 never seen the scale of philanthropy that the Microsoft founder has amassed and
 secured for good causes in the developing world.
The interview airs tonight on Channel 4 News and viewers have been tweeting ques
tions for it all day. Bill's reputation is as technology man, and much of his mo
ney has been spent on the search for technological answers to disease.
Some have argued he's favoured vaccines over the human factors - more nurses, do
ctors and community development. But his wife Melinda has compensated to some ex
tent by channelling more recent gates funding into these areas. The Gates Founda
tion has also been behind a huge GM crop programme in India, which is locally co
ntroversial.
