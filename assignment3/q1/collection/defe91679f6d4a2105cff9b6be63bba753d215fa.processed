Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks Mississippi From Shutting Down Only Abortion
Clinic

   By The Associated Press [67]Monday, April 15, 2013 11:54 p.m. CDT
   (1) Upvote 0

   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked
   Mississippi from revoking the license of the state's only abortion
   clinic.

   U.S. District Judge Daniel P. Jordan III extended an injunction he
   issued several months ago, which blocks the state from closing the
   clinic while it tries to fulfill a 2012 state law.

   The law requires all OB-GYNs who do abortions at Jackson Women's Health
   Organization to have privileges to admit patients to a local hospital.

   Jordan's ruling comes three days before the state Department of Health
   was scheduled to hold a license revocation hearing for the clinic over
   its acknowledged inability to get the admitting privileges. Now the
   administrative hearing won't be held, said health department
   spokeswoman Liz Sharlot.

   Jordan's ruling says the state cannot close the clinic while it still
   has a federal lawsuit pending to challenge the 2012 law. A trial date
   has not been set.

   The Department of Health notified Jackson Women's Health Organization
   in late January that it intended to revoke the clinic's license. The
   clinic was allowed to stay open as it awaited this week's hearing.

   Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights,
   praised the judge's decision.

   "While the women of Mississippi may be able to breathe a collective
   sigh of relief today, this fight is far from over," Northup said in a
   news release Monday. "We will continue our work to see this underhanded
   attempt to ban abortions in Mississippi struck down as a violation of
   women's constitutional reproductive rights."

   Admitting privileges can be difficult to obtain. Some hospitals won't
   issue them to out-of-state physicians, while hospitals that are
   affiliated with religious groups might not want to associate with
   anyone who does elective abortions. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley last
   week signed a similar requirement into law for physicians who work at
   abortion clinics in his state.

   Clinic owner Diane Derzis told The Associated Press on Monday that
   Jackson Women's Health Organization has been unable to get the
   privileges at any of the Jackson-area hospitals where it applied. She
   said she believes that's in large part because hospital administrators
   don't want anti-abortion protesters outside their facilities.

   Even if physicians don't have admitting privileges, a patient can be
   transferred from the clinic to a hospital emergency room, if needed.
   The clinic has said the customary practice is for a hospital to remain
   in contact with the physician who transferred the patient to the
   emergency room, regardless of whether that doctor has admitting
   privileges at the hospital.

   The clinic is about two miles north of the state Capitol building, in a
   trendy neighborhood with restaurants, art galleries and clothing
   stores. The clinic was painted cherry pink earlier this year, a much
   more noticeable color than its previous faded mauve paint job. The
   clinic is separated from a street by an iron fence woven with the type
   of heavy black vinyl that's used for easy-clean restaurant tablecloths.

   Outside the clinic Monday, abortion opponents prayed, sang hymns and
   used a microphone to call out to women who headed inside for
   state-mandated counseling. A longstanding state law requires women to
   be told certain information at least 24 hours before an abortion can be
   done. Among other things, a physician is required to tell women that
   abortion can increase the risk of breast cancer, a claim disputed by
   many medical professionals.

   Mill, pro-life and misogyny aren't synonyms; especially if the fetus is
   female. Wouldn't that be the opposite of misogyny?
