[24]Mark Sanford to Appalachia: Take a hike!

   South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford wipes his eyes as he speaks to the
   media about his trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina and admits to an
   extramarital affair at the State House in Columbia, South Carolina,
   June 24, 2009. Governor Sanford said on Wednesday
   Mark Sanford shortly after returning from his "hike along the
   Appalachian Trail"
   The GOP's war on the poor [30]takes a comedic [DEL: detour :DEL] hike:

     On Wednesday night, [Rep. Steve] Chabot went on the House floor and
     argued that the Appalachian Regional Commission and a handful of
     other similar commissions are wasteful and duplicative.

   Obviously, there's nothing funny about the fact that Chabot wants to
   defund [31]a commission whose entire purpose is to pursue economic
   development in one of the poorest regions of the country. But this was:

     But even before he made his case, Chabot thanked [Rep. Mark]
     Sanford, the politician who is perhaps most associated with the
     Appalachian region.

     "I want to thank the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Sanford, for
     his leadership in co-sponsoring this particular amendment with me,"
     said Chabot.

   Obviously, Sanford is just doing this to spare his family the pain and
   horror of ever needing to think about the Appalachian Trail again.
   Because nothing is more important to him than his values.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [44]Tagging tips - [45]Search For Tags - [46]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
