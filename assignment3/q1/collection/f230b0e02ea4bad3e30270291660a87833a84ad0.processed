       happen to me...

     * [32]BP effort to stop settlement payments fails:

     The Louisiana federal judge overseeing the multi-district litigation
     and the BP settlement refused the oil company's request to suspend
     claim payments for damages from the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

     BP wanted payments suspended because of allegations of misconduct by
     an employee at an Alabama claims center, but an internal probe by an
     investigator working for Patrick Juneau, the claims administrator,
     found no evidence of fraud.
     * [33]Democratic group rewriting George W. Bush Presidential Library
       and Museum version of his legacy: Staff at the Democratic nonprofit
       group Bridge Project, with a focus "exposing the conservative
       movement's dishonest tactics," has decided the library's history of
       Bush's time in office doesn't quite tell the 43rd president's story
       accurately. So it has launched a website, BushRewrite.org, to
       "rectify the falsehoods and omissions of the Bush library."

     The Bush library contents are "American fiction," Eddie Vale, vice
     president of Bridge Project, told HuffPost. "The inaccuracies and
     omissions are a disservice to the annals of history, but ignoring
     the lessons of the Bush administration poses a threat to our
     nation's future. The failure to recognize the consequences of Bush's
     policy decisions is why today's congressional Republicans are even
     more ambitious than Bush ever was in pursuing the policies that
     served as the catalyst for the crises from which we are still
     recovering."
     * [34]GDP growth in 2nd quarter adjusted upward to 2.5 percent: Gross
       domestic product for the second quarter was reported last month at
       1.7 percent compared with 1.1 percent for the first quarter.

     The upward revision to the percent change in real GDP primarily
     reflected an upward revision to exports, a downward revision to
     imports, and an upward revision to private inventory investment that
     were partly offset by a downward revision to state and local
     government spending.
     * [35]"Dirtiest hotel" owner can't sue for defamation:

     The owner of a Tennessee hotel dubbed "America's dirtiest" in a 2011
     list on the website of TripAdvisor Inc. has been told by another
     judge, this time in an appeals court, that he can't sue the online
     travel site for defamation. [...]

     Even though the hotel has reportedly closed, a listing for it
     remains on TripAdvisor's website with 226 out of 321 reviewers
     rating it as "terrible." Four other hotels in Pigeon Forge, however,
     are ranked worse.
     * [36]Mother Jones cites "nine wildest complaints" about Trump
       University. The rip-off operation spurred New York Attorney General
       Eric Schneiderman to announce a lawsuit against it. No. 1 complaint
       from MoJo's Thomas Stackpole:

     Trump U's "handpicked" instructors didn't know anything about real
     estate: Trump University, the filing alleges, "repeatedly claimed
     that prospective students would be taught by successful real estate
     'experts' who were 'handpicked' by Donald Trump. In fact,
     respondents lacked substantiation for the claims that their
     instructors and mentors were successful real estate entrepreneurs.
     Not a single one was 'handpicked' by Donald Trump. Many came to
     Trump University from jobs having little to do with real estate
     investments, and some came to Trump University shortly after their
     real estate investing caused them to go into bankruptcy."
     * [37]Legislator who wants to arm teachers shoots teacher with rubber
       bullet during training exercise:

     A state senator who is advocating for arming teachers in the
     aftermath of the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut,
     accidentally shot a teacher with a rubber bullet during a training
     course, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports.

     Arkansas Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson (R) recently participated in "active
     shooter" training and mistakenly shot a teacher who was confronting
     a so-called bad guy. The experience gave Hutchinson "some pause" but
     failed to shake his confidence in the plan.
     * [38]Americans are driving less in nearly every state. A [39]new
       report from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group concludes that
       over the past eight years, miles traveled have steadily dropped.
       Only in North Dakota, Nevada, Louisiana and Alabama were driving
       miles per capita in 2011 above their 2004 or 2005 peaks:

     Young people everywhere are driving far less than prior generations
     -- while 97 percent of 19 year olds had drivers licenses in 1983,
     only 69 percent did in 2011. The average driving miles for people
     between the ages of 16 and 34 also dropped dramatically between 2001
     and 2009.

       It was an "encore performance" of the [41]Kagro in the Morning show
       today, with another look back at where we were a year ago:
       Recapping the craziness of the Republican National Convention's
       first night, both on the podium and on the floor. Rick Santorum's
       grandfather's (secretly socialist) hands. Kelly Ayotte's lemonade
       stand. Nikki Haley's Sudafed. Chris Christie's... Chris Christie.
       And more. Plus Greg Dworkin's daily polling and issues analysis,
       and Armando's take on the shouting down of Zoraida Fonalledas.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [52]Tagging tips - [53]Search For Tags - [54]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     Arkansas Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson (R) recently participated in "active

       OK live ammo exercises are routine if you are in the military but a
       bunch of would be Rambos armed with rubber bullets shooting at each
       other?  Rubber bullets can be as deadly as lead bullets and even
       blanks, at close range can kill.
       Wonder if Jeremy is OK, if an intruder appears in the doorway, with
       the teacher shooting over the class to hit the intruder?  After
       all, in dealing with confrontational situations, getting a clear or
       clean shot is often the problem in firing or returning fire

   I won't name names for fear of being sued for slander but there are a
   couple big name travel review sites with the same owner and I have
   found that the sites delete any comments that referernce bedbug issues
   in particular hotels. These hotels just happen to also be featured on a
   site associated with the travel review sites.

   If you go to a popular hotel site and see a great deal on a hotel, make
   sure that you double check with bedbugregistry.com.

   You'll thank me for it when you don't get the bugs.

 It ain't slander if its true... ([219]0+ / 0-)
       That said, bedbugs happen everywhere, even in 5-star hotels.
       Perhaps they've found that one report of a bed bug issue is so
       damaging to a hotel's rep that they have to delete them. For me, I
       wouldn't immediately disqualify a hotel for having bedbugs. I'd
       disqualify them for not resolving the situation immediately by
       moving the people, comping them something of significance, and

       By the way, I think that dude in Pigeon Forge has a point. Nothing
       in Tennessee can remotely come close to the disaster that is some
       hotels in Manhattan. In my younger days, I stayed in "hotels" there
       that looked and smelled like a meth lab run by diseased rats. I'm
       talking condoms and needles in the trash can, rusty springs popping
       through mattresses, and the Chinese restaurant venting its kitchen
       through my room stuff. I had a Scarlett O'hara moment leaving that
       pit - as God is my witness, I will never stay in a hotel where
       rooms have police tape over them again.

   In the San Jose Mercury today, as it's pretty close to my opinion:

     Military threats wrong approach in Syria

     Instead of threatening military action against Syria, the United
     States should attend the upcoming international meeting about the
     conflict there. The Assad government is willing to attend, but the
     Syrian rebels say they won't unless Assad resigns. Making the
     opposition's capitulation a prerequisite precludes negotiation. The
     goal of the meeting should be a cease-fire, which would stop the
     killing and facilitate aid delivery.

     Every military action precipitates far-reaching consequences,
     intended and unintended. The United States' illegal attack on the
     Gaddafi government in Libya devastated that nation. Today militias
     terrorize the civilians and the infrastructure needed by the
     population no longer exists. The overthrow of the Gaddafi government
     precipitated a migration that led to war in Mali. Though neither
     Gaddafi nor his opponents were jihadi extremists, a further chain of
     consequences from that intervention led to the encouragement of
     activity by such in the region. It is likely the Libyan intervention
     led the Syrian armed rebels (not the original peaceful protesters)
     to believe they could bring about a similar intervention. The United
     States must not encourage such ideas by military interventions, but
     rather use its influence to support negotiations.

     Though neither Gaddafi nor his opponents were jihadi extremists, a
     further chain of consequences from that intervention led to the
     encouragement of activity by such in the region.
       Opposition to Gaddafi in the far eastern part of Libya had long
       been led by jihadis although not all of them had any connection
       with Al Qaeda. There were several assassination attempts by such
       groups in the late '80s and the '90s.
       One reason Gaddafi was so eager to help the U.S. after 9/11 was
       that he saw a means of crushing this opposition (along with other
       opposition that had considerably different and secular goals). The
       U.S. sent some Libyans captured in the early Afghan war to be
       tortured by Gaddafi as part of the cooperative deal they struck.
       That deal, by the way, included high-level meetings between the CIA
       and Musa Kusa, the former security chief many believe to have been
       the mastermind behind the Pan Am 103 bombing.

 I'll add, I think the Iraq comparison is ([273]0+ / 0-)
       just really, incredibly wrong. There is PLENTY of reason to oppose

       But to equate limited airstrikes in Syria with going into Iraq with
       100K+ troops on a regime change mission is just inaccurate.
       I can understand a dumb, lazy media making the comparison. For
       them, it's military action against two countries in the Middle
       East, so what's the difference?
       But I would expect better from many on the left.

 A note on food carts ([301]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [302]Eric Nelson, [303]LinSea, [304]Miggles

   I was both saddened (for selfish reasons) and gladdened (for
   magnanimous reasons) to learn that a local El Salvadoran food cart in
   downtown Portland, OR was closing tomorrow.

   The owner, an industrious woman who one sees only in silhouette in the
   cart interior preparing delicious pupusas, curtido, empanadas, and
   tamales, is closing the cart and opening a restaurant east of the
   Cascades in Madras, OR.

   Another example of a new business owner taking advantage of the
   (relatively) low startup cost of a food cart to grow a business until a
   brick-and-mortar restaurant can be established. This is a well-worn
   path taken by others, such as Andy Ricker of Portland's (and now New
   York's) famous [305]Pok Pok/Whiskey Soda Lounge and the spinoff of a
   former Pok Pok cook, Narumol Poonsukwattana (commonly known as Nong)
   and her well regarded [306]Nong's Khao Man Gai food carts and take-out
   location.

   Say what you will about food carts in urban areas, but they can provide
   opportunity for entrepreneurs, at relatively low cost, to establish a
   business that, if you hit the right formula and can run a business,
   provides a pathway to grow into a larger enterprise (if that's your
   goal).  While they arguably pose challenges to traditional restaurants
   and take-out windows (lower overhead, no requirement to provide seating
   or restrooms), they can significantly enhance the diversity of cuisines
   being offered within their relatively modest sphere of influence. More
   cities should revise their ordinances to encourage such
   entrepreneurship.

   Some criticize food cart lines and "pods" (clusters of food carts,
   often on vacant lots) as visual blight, but I think they're examples of
   initiative and hard work. They also offer customers the chance to try
   foods from around the world they may never have encountered before.

   Good luck to Fatima in Madras!

 Rachel Maddow talks w/ Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson. ([309]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [310]LinSea

   ..former Chief of Staff to SoS Colin Powell on GWB/Cheney lead up to
   Iraq and how what we're hearing from the GOP is like a replay video

   AT 6:00 minutes into the video  Rachel asks Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson
   whether  republicans  recent Syria/Iran war-talk and GWB Library Iraq
   whitewashing  ( see below) has any effect on today's debates about
   Syria and how it compares to the selling of the Iraq war:

     "I see us walking down the same road with the same characters
     singing in the choir, the same people off the same sheet of music
     with a few changes, trying to get us into a war with Iran.
     The new momentum with respect to Syria is not just because of a
     brutal civil war there, it's also because people like Lindsey Graham
     and John McCain from my party and Bob Menedez from the Democratic
     party would like to use Syria as a back door to get us into Iran.
     This is another catastrophe brewing and if people don't wake up and
     start saying something about it, they're going to find themselves in
     another trillion dollar ten year war that's going to produce the
     results not unlike those in Iraq today..and let me just say Iraq is
     a mess today.."

   Colonel Wilkerson then reminds us of Iraq today
   (short commercial - sorry) [EMBED]

   So GWB has an interactive game that admonishes you if you choosee not
   to invade or as Bush puts it "lead" us into war - It's hysterical - not
   in a funny way at all

   Transcript @ link: [311]http://www.nbcnews.com/...

   Also interactive whitewashing at the new GWB library-  this clip
   showing an interactive game justifying Iraq war.  Rachel's crew filmed
   while playing the "decider" game at the GWB library

   [EMBED]

   Transcript @ link: :  [312]http://www.nbcnews.com/...

   So major Kudos to:

     Bridge Project, with a focus "exposing the conservative movement's
     dishonest tactics," has decided the library's history of Bush's time
     in office doesn't quite tell the 43rd president's story accurately.
     So it has launched a website, BushRewrite.org, to "rectify the
     falsehoods and omissions of the Bush library."
