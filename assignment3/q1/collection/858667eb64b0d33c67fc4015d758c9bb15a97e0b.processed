[22]Open thread for night owls: Was the global oil market rigged?

   Yet another major market scandal [29]may be in the works:

     The London offices of BP and Shell have been raided by European
     regulators investigating allegations they have "colluded" to rig oil
     prices for more than a decade. [...]

     Lord Oakeshott, former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the
     alleged rigging of oil prices was "as serious as rigging Libor" -
     which led to banks being fined hundreds of millions of pounds.

   At issue is the LIBOR-like method of voluntary reporting of oil prices:

     "The suspected violations are related to the Platts' Market-On-Close
     (MOC) price assessment process, used to report prices in particular
     for crude oil, refined oil products and biofuels, and may have been
     ongoing since 2002." [...]

     The EC said the big oil companies may have "prevented others from
     participating in the price assessment process, with a view to
     distorting published prices".

   The ongoing lesson here seems to be that in every financial market that
   relies on "voluntary" price reporting, the market can and will be
   manipulated by the largest players--and as it turns out, that consists
   of nearly every financial market, period, full stop. As Matt Taibbi
   says, [30]everything is rigged.

   The entire world's financial market suffers from a single, fatal flaw:
   The largest companies within it, the companies that therefore manage
   and govern it, either implicitly or explicitly, can make very, very
   large amounts of money at no perceptible risk simply by being crooked.

   In market after market, such behaviors appear to be not merely
   commonplace, but woven into the very design of those marketplaces
   themselves. The reason the one percent have gained so much, so fast in
   these last few decades is simply because they rewrote the rules until
   they could. They've got their thumb on every scale.

   [31]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2007--Stepping up
   Pressure on Iraq:

   The Feingold-Reid amendment, expected to come up tomorrow morning, will
   be for the Senate what the McGovern amendment was in last week's House
     vote on the Iraq supplemental--the baseline vote for how committed
    Democratic senators are to ending this war before the next election.

                 What's more, as noted in this AP story it:

     has the makings of a turning point in the Democratic presidential
     campaign, obliging Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama to
     take a fresh look at calls for cutting off war funds.

    The vote will show the willingness of Clinton and Obama, and all the
     Democratic Senators, to exercise their most important Congressional
           power--the power of the purse--to check the executive.

   Obama announced today that he will support Feingold-Reid, though in his
       statement he doesn't address the concept of ending the funding.

   Debt & deficit hawkery. Is it the "scandal" feeding frenzy? Or is the

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [55]Tagging tips - [56]Search For Tags - [57]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       was: is that phrase actually some quirky southern, Texan turn of
       phrase? or is Gohmie-bear just that much of a 'tard?
       i searched the net and couldn't find any reference to that idiom
       being used, so I must assume he's just an idiot.
       if anyone else has any insight into whether "cast asperisons on my
       asparagus" is some kind of hardy-har-har Texas saying, or local
       quirk, please do correct me!

                [267]aguadito, [268]417els, [269]JeffW, [270]antirove

       (perhaps originally a malapropism), is "casting asparagus" in place
       of "casting aspersions".
       What Gohmert actually thought he was saying is beyond me, unless he
       was trying to say 'casting asparagus on my assertions', which would
       actually have fit what he seemed to be trying to say. Double
       malaprop to Gohmert.
       At least half the future I've been expecting hasn't gotten here
       yet. Sigh.... (Yes, there's gender bias in my name; no, I wasn't

       Gohmie-bear was just trying to turn the "anchor baby" (their
       offensive term used for the birth tourism) issue into an emotional
       terror national security issue to make it more politically popular
       to refuse the rights of babies born within our borders to get
       American citizenship.
       it's shows just how shameless and racist some of these southern
       republicans are. to try and use terrorism as a way to hurt working
       class Latinos from getting a better life in America.
       what the GOP needs to do is change their shitty policies, that way
       they wouldn't see the birth of a working class Latino in the US, a
       brand new American, as an existential threat!!
       i don't get why we (as Americans) never learn our lesson. first we
       hated the germans and irishmen, then we focused hate on the blacks,
       and chinese immigrants who stayed after the railroad, and then
       blacks again, and now hispanics.  and now the very irishmen and
       central europeans who are descendants of immigrants who were
       persecuted are now part of groups persecuting the next generation
       because they look different! why can't we just embrace the future
       generations and win them over with our ideas that we can pass
       along.
       birthright citizenship within our borders is something we should
       cherish and never end!

   if it was in the US, Holder's DoJ would probably issue a fine

       the details of these fake scandals are so absolutely boring.
       whenever real issues are being ignored, or real data isn't coming
       out showing what policies would be good and needed, i get so bored
       with "politics as usual".
       I have no patience really for trying to figure out just how stupid
       the GOP hysteria over Benghazi is, or the 1000th stupid action by
       Republicans in DC.
       It's actually exciting when there's a real policy debate going on
       where things will actually happen.
       But the House seems intent on preventing any spending increases, so
       austerity is here to stay.
       And the President is intent on playing the victim and throwing his
       hands up in the air and negotiating with himself.
       And of course Reid doesn't give a single fuck about filibuster
       reform (not that it matters, since the House is packed with
       obstructionist radical teahadists).
       So what is there to really get excited about? The only stuff
       passing congress right now is [744]secret, weekend-long unanimous
       voice votes to kill provisions in pro-transparency bills and
       [745]efforts to ease the sequester's impact on the wealthy, while
       maintaining regressive cuts to the poor and elderly. Immigration
       reform seems both promising and problematic, and may lead to some
       fun 2014 primaries -- but until then, meh.
       The only thing left to do is to yawn at the faux scandals, wait for
       newsworthy shock events to happen that may force action, and watch
       the bad economic news tumble in (this stock market bubble is bound
       to pop, corporations can only cut their way to profits for so long
       while demand is sluggish...)
       Deficits don't matter, jobs do.

   ..2012. This is not the Global story that the Guardian and this diary
   is covering but WTF
   [824]6 West Coast Senators Urge DOJ to Investigate Western Gas Price
   Spikes - Nov 27 2012

   Senator Cantell and these senators wrote to AJ Holder

     Today, the six senators from Washington, Oregon, and California
     demanded that the Department of Justice (DOJ) conduct a
     refinery-by-refinery investigation into the cause of spikes that
     drove gas prices to more than $4 a gallon in Western states during
     May and October.

     In a letter sent today to Attorney General Eric Holder, the Senators
     called on the Department of Justice's Oil and Gas Price Fraud
     Working Group to investigate whether market manipulation or false
     reporting by oil refineries contributed to near-record gas prices on
     the West Coast earlier this year.

     The letter was sent by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA,) Ron Wyden
     (D-OR), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Barbara Boxer
     (D-CA), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).

     "We are requesting a Department of Justice investigation of possible
     market manipulation and false reporting by oil refineries which may
     have created a perception of a supply shortage, when in fact
     refineries were still producing," the six Senators wrote. "A
     McCullough Research report released Nov. 15th in conjunction with a
     California State Senate hearing on California gas prices revealed
     information that showed that the price spikes in May and October
     occurred while crude oil prices were declining, inventories were
     increasing, and possibly in conjunction with misleading
     market-making information.  We hope the Justice Department and
     members of the Oil and Gas Price Fraud Working Group will launch a
     refinery-by-refinery level probe."

     The letter comes on the heels of a report from McCullough Research
     indicating that some West Coast oil refineries may have been
     producing oil last May despite public reports that they were
     shuttered for maintenance.

   Rachel Maddow covered this story, but then..crickets from the MSM

     An extensive analysis of emissions monitoring data by McCullough
     found that the Chevron refinery in Richmond, Calif., emitted
     byproducts of petroleum production throughout May. Yet public
     reports claim the refinery shut down production from May 12 to May
     26.

     According to the McCullough report, the October price spike added up
     to a 66 cent-per-gallon windfall profit for oil companies - or about
     $25 million a day. The difference between what drivers actually paid
     and what they should have paid exceeded $1 billion.
      - emphasis added


     The reason the one percent have gained so much, so fast in these
     last few decades is simply because they rewrote the rules until they
     could. They've got their thumb on every scale. - Hunter

   That scale must include the MSM, because when a working person monthly
   fuel bill skyrockets that story should be huge. Somehow it never is, at
   least not for more than brief moment that is.

   Hmmm. Let's see.

   We've got one major organization, OPEC, that is very forthrightly all
   about manipulating the price of oil.
   We've got a major share of the global market in the hands of a few
   major international players who must certainly chit-chat about, ummm,
   everything else in the world EXCEPT for oil when they get together at
   the club wink-wink.

   But even if we didn't know that,  it seems so damned obvious from
   watching prices over the last few years.  How often can you correlate a
   price spike with something that ought to spike the price?  How often
   does the price spike when there is international news -- regardless of
   whether it affects supply?

   The real question:

   Will anybody take away the right lesson?

   WAS it rigged? Umm... remember when the price of oil topped out at over
   $150 a barrel? And the "reason" was the war in Iraq. There was no
   interruption of supply, there was no danger to shipping. there was just
   Mr. Big saying "let's crank it UP, boys! WOO HA HA HA..."

   And when enough people got testy, and a few congressmen actually made
   noise about an excess profit tax - not a cut in price, just a tax -
   they brought it back down. But now that we know oil can be "worth" $150
   bbl, they brought it back down to $!5 higher per barrel. Don't bend

   Do they rig oil prices? Not worth the electrons to type the question.

   But the DoJ faux "scandal" isn't, either. I can't understand why
   everyone is crying foul here when there is a huge difference between a
   Grand Jury subpoena and random data mining.

   Data mining is done (under the Patriot Act) before--and often
   without--any court authorization. Huge amounts of it have occurred
   since Bush. Try to sell used cars to X-o-stan, and you are probably on
   a list.

   This targeted examination was done with prior Grand Jury authorization.
   We may do our OMGs because it was reporters, but it's not a reporter
   they are after. They are after the source of a leak. In the past we've
   seen egregious leaks, including a GOP Congresscritter who revealed the
   location of the CIA office in Benghazi. In this case it appears to have
   hampered the investigation of a terrorist plot, and may very well be a
   GOP target.

   If every attempt to get data from phone or internet records had to have
   prior Grand Jury authorization, we wouldn't be so close to Big Brother
   in this country.

 I know I'm a little late getting on this bus ([876]0+ / 0-)

   but when I read the following: "The entire world's financial market
   suffers from a single, fatal flaw: The largest companies within it, the
   companies that therefore manage and govern it, either implicitly or
   explicitly, can make very, very large amounts of money at no
   perceptible risk simply by being crooked.

   In market after market, such behaviors appear to be not merely
   commonplace, but woven into the very design of those marketplaces
   themselves. The reason the one percent have gained so much, so fast in
   these last few decades is simply because they rewrote the rules until
   they could. They've got their thumb on every scale."

   -I thought of how this is exactly the kind of quote I used to post at
   Facebook.  Now I can't even sign on to my own page.  It's as if I'm
   being prevented from signing on to my own page at Facebook.  Maybe my
   paranoia, but maybe because I've been pretty persistently
   progressive/anti corporate in my postings???

   "Gun violence places a tremendous burden on America's health care
   system. Direct medical costs for gunshot wounds total more than six
   million dollars a day." - The Violence Policy Center
