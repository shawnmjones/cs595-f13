   Republican candidate for president U.S. Representative Michelle
   Bachmann (R-MN) (C) holds a news conference with Representative Louie
   Gohmert (R-TX) (L) and Representative Steve King (R-IA) (R) to discuss
   the debt ceiling and military benefits, at the U.S
   Behind every crazy teabagger are two more crazy teabaggers

   The Bachmanns celebrate victory
   Break out the corn dogs, because we have a winner in the 2013 Daily Kos
   Republican March to Madness Tournament, and her name is Michele
   Bachmann.

   Bachmann, who made the final round as winner of the Teabaggers Region,
   fought her way [29]through a field that included luminaries of lunacy
   from Dick Cheney to Donald Trump, from W. Mitt Romney to George W.
   Bush, from Rush Limbaugh to Ann Coulter, and from Pat Robertson to Rand
   Paul. On her path to victory she took down giants of the GOP Insanity
   Machine, including Allen West, Ted Cruz, Steve King, and Rush Limbaugh.
   And in her final matchup, she absolutely destroyed Rick Santorum,
   getting more than three-quarters of the vote.

   So here she stands: Michele Bachmann, the 2013 GOP March to Madness
   Champion. And let's wish her all the luck in the world over the next
   year as she continues to make her name synonymous with the wackiest
   ideas of the extreme right, because if we have any luck at all,
   Minnesotans will have the wisdom to make 2014 her last year as an
   elected official.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [41]Tagging tips - [42]Search For Tags - [43]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [44]Civil
   Rights, [45]Community, [46]Congress, [47]Culture, [48]Economy,
   [49]Education, [50]Elections, [51]Energy, [52]Environment, [53]Health
   Care, [54]International, [55]Labor, [56]Law, [57]Media, [58]Meta,
   [59]National Security, [60]Science, [61]Transportation, or [62]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([63]California, [64]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   It takes a special kind of crazy to beat Cheney and limbaugh. Break out
   the Thorazine and straight jacket tonight Michele, you earned it.

   You're just a bully who found it easier and easier and decided that
   everybody else wasn't really a person, not like you, and when you know
   that, there's no crime too big, is there? No crime you won't do.'

       Cheney and Limbaugh are pure evil. Michelle Bachmann, on the other
       hand, is pure Crazy, along the lines of Glenn Beck, but cuter.

       I was thinking about the top "crazy" repug and yup, Bachmann is
       pretty much 51/50.  Beck isn't crazy, neither is
       Cheney/Limbaugh/GWB/et al. Mostly they're greedy MF's that would
       sell their souls to the highest bidder.
       Gotta say though - it is bugging me that the most crazy ends up
       being a female.  I wouldn't want to be in her home when PMS
       strikes.

   My ducats were on a Cheney/Coulter contest. Bachmann is an entertaining
   kinda nutz. Coulter, hell no. Whenever she opens her mouth, I hear the
   cries of tortured souls in the pits of Hell, where Cheneysatan is
   stabbing them with a manure-crusted red-hot pitchfork.

   Bachmann, you could almost see fixing her up with your ne'er do well
   cousin as a lark.

   I am of the opinion that using a winner-take-all approach is not the
   best way to celebrate the craziness that is today's modern consevatism.

   May I suggest instead we should be employing an Oscar-style
   celebration, where each brand of crazy can be recognized for their
   uniques gifts?

   I mean, c'mon: Michelle Bachmann is crazy as a long-tailed cat in a
   room full of rocking chairs, but how can we possibly belittle the
   craziness of Limbaugh, or Trump, or Pat Robertson.  All of them deserve
   full recognition for their special crazy stylings.

   So I'm suggesting we select some categories to better represent the
   full range of crazy, and award winners in each category.  We can have
   "Craziest Use of the Media", "Best supporting actor for the financial
   industry", "Best hair", "Best sex scandal", etc.  We could even have a
   few life-time acheivement awards for those conservatives who continue
   to amaze and astound us year after year.

   That said, congrats to M. Bachmann for her outstanding achievement.
   Tho' I am sure Trump is back at his hotel saying "wait 'til next year"!

   is to the left what a monkey photoshop of Obama is to the right.

   It's pandering to a known conformity of bias to elicit a cheap easily
   earned nod, or wink.

   A chuckle, sure but then what echoes in the mind for the rest of the
   day?

   I guess I haven't found a home, really.

   I thought Kos was an idea community with things like the notion of arts
   and letters leading the way. But there's no filtration this week, every
   headline looks ad hominen, every voice is yelling, and the only
   difference between the tea party and what I see here today are the
   labels used for the prejudice and righteous mob gathering.

   Big Sign on top: No moderate P.O.V. accepted.

   It might look like salad forks and sparklers, but the political
   pendulum swings a mighty arc bent by a savage gravity, and when this
   stuff grows up it becomes torches and pitchforks.

   I guess I am just floored by the popularity of a headline right here
   --> making satire of a kid accidentally killing a person with a gun. I
   take some of Get incensed when Limbaugh makes a joke of lessor things,
   then make this a joke? No difference on the sophistication meter.

   The world needs more editors to keep cranky old guys like me
   interested, I guess. Or I am just grumpy, but I know how it works - no
   dissent allowed, move it along...

 Upon Receiving Her Award, ([660]1+ / 0-)

   Representative Bachmann, with tears of joy streaming down her rosy
   rouged cheeks declared:  "You hate me. You really hate me!"

 Uhhhh...big mistake making her the winner ([667]1+ / 0-)

   Though I must admit I voted for her. She'll use this award as a badge
   of honor to raise millions from the deranged America-hating suckers who
   support her and think she's a victim. Just watch...

 Don't blame Minnesota... ([671]0+ / 0-)

     Minnesotans will have the wisdom to make 2014 her last year as an
     elected official.

   From your keyboard to God's ears...
   Unfortunately, most voters in her district are batshit crazy and it was
   recently gerrymandered to make it more conservative. But hope springs
   eternal...

   Look, Santorum can pull this thing out, especially in places where
   there's lots of people who, um, will vote for Santorum so you shouldnt
   be so eager to blah blah yadda yadda and on and on and on.

 I am just happy ([680]0+ / 0-)

   that she has found her niche.

   I hope she crawls into it, and never sees the light of day again.

   Bachmann said, in dealing with Iran, diplomacy "is our option", but
   that other options, including a nuclear strike, shouldn't be taken off
   the table.

 Worthy finalists! ([689]0+ / 0-)

   Here it is, a day later, and the 2013 March to Madness was uncannily
   accurate.
   Bachmann was back home, talking to a local town hall with another
   Congressman, and ran off the stage, surrounded by staffers who shielded
   her when questions about her campaign finance irregularities started
   being shouted out by the audience.

   The Teabag Queen can dish it out, but she sure as hell can't take it!

   Meanwhile, Santorum was denied use of a school auditorium for planned
   rally. Mr. Mean would not submit a copy of his speech to the school
   district, who was rightfully nervous about what he would say, so they
   pulled his permit.

   As usual, Santorum got all mad and snarly. Just like he always does
   when he loses. And he loses, over and over and over.

   Both worthy finalists, for sure!

   Right many are called, and damn few are chosen.

 Where are the quotes from the winner? ([696]0+ / 0-)

   Can't D-Kos ask CNN's Dana Bash to chase down Bachman and get her
   response to this honour.  It was a much cleaner win than her last
   congressional race!
