[24]Sorry, Republicans. #Obamaquester didn't do the trick. You're still
losing sequester blame game

   House Speaker John Boehner and other House Republicans hold press
   conference aimed at blaming President Obama for the sequester with a
   sign reading
   For the past few weeks, House Speaker John Boehner and his Republican
   colleagues have been relentlessly attacking President Obama for the
   sequester, accusing him of being entirely responsible for what they
   said would be severely damaging cuts. They even [30]rolled out a
   Twitter hash tag, #Obamaquester.

   Tragically, the GOP's efforts have been a complete bust. For example,
   the [31]latest Washington Post-Pew Research survey shows that more
   Americans will blame Republicans if (make that when) the sequester goes
   into effect, mirroring a survey released [32]earlier this month by USA
   Today, also conducted by Pew.

   As you can see, the new poll shows that 45 percent of adults say they
   would blame Republicans compared with 32 percent who say they would
   blame Obama:
   Washington Post and Pew Survey data conducted Feb 21-24, 2013 among
   American adults
   Republicans seem to be aware of their [33]total messaging failure.
   They've been simultaneously insisting on the sequester and trying to
   say it's the world's worst thing and Obama is entirely to blame. So now
   they're starting to try a new message, [34]voiced yesterday by House
   Speaker John Boehner. The sequester, they now say, will save "tens of
   millions of jobs" that will be created at some point in the future.

   In other words, Republicans are now saying the sequester is a good
   thing. Which I guess means they will soon start demanding credit, just
   as soon as those tens of millions of jobs start getting created. Alas,
   on this too it turns out they've got a problem: according to the
   Post-Pew survey, 62 percent of adults think the sequester will have a
   negative effect on the economy and 55 percent say they think the
   sequester a major effect (presumably negative) on the U.S. military. So
   even though Republicans are doing a bang-up job at receiving credit for
   the sequester, they might want to rethink their political strategy all
   over again.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       the poll ratings for Republicans go before they bottom out.
       Standing up to Republican extortion is giving Ameircans a chance to
       feel the effects of Republican policies.  It's unfortunate, but all
       other options offered by Republicans are worse than the sequester.

       Even a gerrymandered House can be voted out in 2014.  It will take
       until then to ened government by crisis and extortion.

       They don't care.  They see it as a badge of honor.  In particular,
       the TeaBag wing of the party thinks that having the majority of
       citizens against it is a good thing, since most of those citizens
       are freeloading parasites who need to be taught a thing or three.

 That's true. Most House Repubs are in "safe ([195]0+ / 0-)

   seats."

   So, this would logically not be a great concern of theirs.  Coupled
   with the fact that even the Dem politicians and talking heads admitted
   on the Feb 24th Sunday Talk Shows that nothing 'drastic' will happen
   this Friday if a deal's not reached, I wouldn't expect them to be that
   concerned, really.

   (BTW, the Dems I'm referring to were conceding that it wouldn't be
   particularly harmful to the economy to go past March 1, IF a deal was
   worked out soon after that date.  Just wanted to clarify.)

       MIGHT invoke that response, although I seriously doubt it, unless
       at least two of the three cuts that Bowles-Simpson recommend, are

       mostly very ill-informed and apathetic folks (if we're honest), I
       wouldn't count on it.
       There seems to be almost no feeling of "civic responsibility" in
       the US, anymore.
       And US citizen apathy has reached such a stratospheric level, that
       few of our politicians worry a whole lot about public opinion.
       It's really quite sad, and tragic.  :-(

   If the GOP (moderate few) could see how the extremist Tea are the cause

   In my estimation, it is a mistake to measure this matter by supposed
   "wins" and "losses" electorally. At the end of the day, people will
   still lose their jobs/benefits...and this nation's economy will take a
   huge step backward. I wish for once we could focus on that instead of
   engaging in the blame game.

       The Republcians will only compromise if you fuck people more.  In

 What exactly would you have them do? ([280]0+ / 0-)
       Force a vote on legislation in the Senate, despite the obvious
       filibuster?  Force Boehner to pass legislation in the House?   If

       anyone.
       I've commented extensively on my view of the "sequester," if you
       need details, you're welcome to check my comment section.
       My 'ditto' of SueDe's comment was regarding her comments below:

     I'm sure it will comfort those losing their jobs.. (5+ / 0-)

     ...to know that the GOP is blamed for the sequester more than
     Democrat leaders.
     In my estimation, it is a mistake to measure this matter by supposed
     "wins" and "losses" electorally. At the end of the day, people will
     still lose their jobs/benefits...and this nation's economy will take
     a huge step backward. I wish for once we could focus on that instead
     of engaging in the blame game.
       I would guess that there have been literally 'scores of diaries' on
       the topic of "who is to blame for the sequester."
       Which puzzles me, since the Administration has acknowledged that it
       was the idea of Jack Lew and Rob Nabors.
       Why don't progressives just acknowledge this, and move on?

     As SueDe puts it:  At the end of the day, people will still lose
     their jobs/benefits...and this nation's economy will take a huge
     step backward. I wish for once we could focus on that instead of
     engaging in the blame game.
       If the progressive community is a caring community, why are we not
       more concerned about what will happen to folks, and fighting for
       policies to ameliorate the sequester (if it happens), instead of
       'beating the dead horse' about "who is to blame?"
       Wouldn't it be wiser to 'let sleeping dogs lie?"
       All that we're doing is repeatedly bringing up the idea that the
       Administration negotiated a bad deal, when they negotiated "the
       sequester."
       Why not put our energy into something constructive?
       That's all I was trying to say.
       And, IMHO, I consider this topic merely a distraction, from what
       really matters.
       And for me, that's stopping draconian cuts to the social insurance
       programs. :-)
       Namaste.

     Even a gerrymandered House can be voted out in 2014.

   The House Republicans nationwide were whipped by the Democrats in 2012
   and still hold a relatively large 30 seat majority. Midterm elections
   are very rarely favorable to the party holding the White House and
   usually just marginally so (a few House seats or a Senator or two).

   To take the House in 2014 with these House districts, the Democrats
   will need a "wave" election coupled with severe infighting on the
   Republican side (as in, third party candidates leeching support from
   the Republican primary winners). It's totally possible just highly
   unlikely.

   And it's not just because of the gerrymandering by Republicans, you
   realize. Geographically, the country is becoming polarized and,
   ironically, it will take even more extreme gerrymandering to make seats
   more competitive.

   Take California... before 2010, its redistricting process was a
   partisan hot mess. So the voters gave responsibility to a nonpartisan
   commission... which barely budged the makeup of the Assembly, State
   Senate and California's House delegations (2 or 3 seat difference in
   each). While a similar nonpartisan process for all districts in the
   country may have made the House Democratic this year, that's not
   necessarily a given.

   House Dems [334]split evenly (95-95) on it, and Senate Dems supported
   it by a landslide vote of 45-6.  It was a bad idea then and a worse
   idea now, but, betweeen the 2 houses, a total of 202 Goopers and 140
   Dems voted for it.

   In signing the bill, [335]the president stated:

       The sequester was a great idea, and I'm hopeful that it will lead
       to some useful back-and-forth between parties who seem to have
       turned their backs on the forth.
       I have a certain sympathy for Boehner -- he's got some real
       whackadoodles to herd.  He's reached a couple of deals, then been
       unable to deliver his own caucus.
       I think we need the political theatre now to make  some people
       sweat in their cushy little congress chairs.
       The issue, you see, is not whether people will or will not suffer.
        People suffer now.  A lot of them.  Have been for the last several
       years, and many of them are losing hope of ever working again.
       The sequester may have been designed to get the attention of
       legislators, but now it's managed to get the attention of the
       population.  Let's see how much give-and-take our leaders are
       willing to do with people watching and tapping their feet.

 I'd say it's a great idea because it IS a great ([352]0+ / 0-)
       idea.
       Nothing was working.
       The GOP has felt no need to recognize that they lost the last
       election.
       So...
       Let the sequester happen -- it will be far less painful than all
       the Chicken Littles pretend, but it will make real cuts in defense
       spending.
       It also provides a basis for our dearly despised legilators to come
       up with things that people might actually like.
       Once the sequester has happened, the trigger has been pulled. The
       negotiations will be about putting things back on the table, and
       plenty of opportunity for smart politics.
       If you have no faith in the Democrats, that is a very scary place
       to be.
       Unless, of course, you're one of the forgotten millions of
       long-term unemployed people.  You're already in a scary place.

       never would've been an issue.  The following exchange took place at
       the [371]12/7/10 press conference:

     Marc Ambinder.

           Q    Mr. President, thank you.  How do these negotiations
     affect negotiations or talks with Republicans about raising the debt
     limit?  Because it would seem that they have a significant amount of
     leverage over the White House now, going in.  Was there ever any
     attempt by the White House to include raising the debt limit as a
     part of this package?
           THE PRESIDENT:  When you say it would seem they'll have a
     significant amount of leverage over the White House, what do you
     mean?
           Q    Just in the sense that they'll say essentially we're not
     going to raise the -- we're not going to agree to it unless the
     White House is able to or willing to agree to significant spending
     cuts across the board that probably go deeper and further than what
     you're willing to do.  I mean, what leverage would you have --
           THE PRESIDENT:  Look, here's my expectation -- and I'll take
     John Boehner at his word -- that nobody, Democrat or Republican, is
     willing to see the full faith and credit of the United States
     government collapse, that that would not be a good thing to happen.
      And so I think that there will be significant discussions about the
     debt limit vote.  That's something that nobody ever likes to vote
     on.  But once John Boehner is sworn in as Speaker, then he's going
     to have responsibilities to govern.  You can't just stand on the
     sidelines and be a bomb thrower.
           And so my expectation is, is that we will have tough
     negotiations around the budget, but that ultimately we can arrive at
     a position that is keeping the government open, keeping Social
     Security checks going out, keeping veterans services being provided,
     but at the same time is prudent when it comes to taxpayer dollars.
       The hostage-taking that took place 7 months later was both
       predictable and preventable.

   is the Democratic shills, the good 'ol boys whos's time has come.

   There are no longer two diametrically opposed opinions on most of the
   subjects (problems) facing the US. The deficit needs to be reduced yes,
   but in a balanced and job nurturing manner. Immigration reform needs to
   be done there is no "CONSERVATIVE " alternative. Global warming
   (climate change) exists and needs to be addressed immediately. Sorry
   once again there is no counter arguement.

   It's finished Republicans, when a party is in need of a platform to
   continue to exist there is no longer a need for the party. After all
   the two parties were formed based on two opposing ideologies. This no
   longer exists. Pragmatic and intelligent versus ignorant and stupid.
   Sorry that's not two opposing ideologies.

   Let's hurry uop and rid Congress off the dead weight; the kind of

       too many still are sheeple and are still being fooled. For some,
       it's the difficulty of admitting they've been so wrong for so long.
       For some, it's the idea that adopting those rightwing beliefs makes
       them patriots or continuing to espouse those beliefs out of some
       weird sense of loyalty to the cause.
       And others are batshit crazy, but we knew that.
       Not enough have given up on the dark side yet.

   Everyone knows who the President is and most believe he is completely
   in charge of everything.

    I would assume a low  amount of voters could name Boehner or Reid and
   even less could even tell you their job title.  Most voters can not
   tell you how any process in Congress works, or even keep up with
   various happenings.  I know this because I see it in my classes.  It is
   a sad commentary that I have freshman and sophomore college students
   that are POLS majors who are generally without knowledge of the above
   until taught correctly.... much less the general population.  This
   should be taught extensively in high school.

   Voters blame whatever happens to their pay check on "the guy in
   charge".....regardless of how or why it happened.

   Boehner a pass on his intransigence.  Every time I see a Democrat on TV
   bemoaning the fact that poor John Boehner can't do anything because of
   his Tea Party caucus, I am infuriated.  Why is he allowed to hide

   Sure, he may lose his speakership as a consequence but really?  Who
   would want the job besides him?

   It is all a smoke screen.  He gets to be the "reasonable" Republican
   when we all know there is no such creature in the House.  Boehner
   himself has declared he will no longer negotiate face-to-face with the
   President, yet he continues his bluster about a lack of leadership from
   the President!

   Democrats need to call him out and stop giving him cover.

   The Republicans are trying to simultaneously insist 1)that the

   really hurt.

   Apparently they learned their argument style from the story of the

       We need to keep in mind what's at stake and that it has very real,
       tangible consequences.
       Being in the lower economic class, I've suffered enough.
       I'm glad I found a job after losing my job of 15 years 2 years ago.
       I'm making .40/hr. less than my last position. So I'm better off
       than many who've lost their jobs in this economy. But I haven't
       made enough money to maintain my rather meager existence (by
       American standards) and be able to afford the odd financial
       emergency i.e.- car repairs.
       I'm 5 to 8 years away from when I'm "supposed" to retire. That's
       never going to happen now. I'll have to work until I drop or am too
       broken to do anything anymore.
       And I'd like to say to all those who have worked to create a
       scenario in which only our money has upward mobility, to those who
       strive and have striven to weaken or destroy the social safety net
       and to every rightwing punk that espouses and supports these
       measures, most to their own detriment:

   is that western democracies have been having this debate for literally
   over 2 centuries, and it never seem to get resolved politically or in
   the public mind even though the economic data overwhelmingly proves,
   beyond any serious doubt, that active government engagement in the
   economy, via monetary, fiscal, tax and economic policy, regulation,
   oversight, social welfare programs, infrastructure, etc., not only
   works, but is absolutely essential to the economic well-being of a
   country, and that high deficit spending during a downturn is
   unavoidable. One can debate the specifics but to dispute this core
   truth is to broker in idiocy, ignorance, dishonesty or delusion.

     Opinions about the Democratic Party are mixed, but the party is

     Party has strong principles (63% vs. 57%).

   Dems can't take any comfort in those numbers. If they stopped caving

   The House Republicans are voted into office essentially by their base
   and are free to ignore everybody else. Their base doesn't believe that
   they receive any kind of services from the federal government and, as
   such, don't care about the sequestration. They're convinced they're
   "independent" "up by their bootstraps" businesspeople and that the feds
   only get in their way.

   It'll take a lesson like losing essential federal services due to
   sequestration -- like "your small business loan application will now
   take 18 months" or "the program helping your child at school has been
   defunded" or "that bridge that was supposed to be repaired this year
   has been put off until 2019" or "your Defense Department customers no

 The best representation of Republicans... ([788]0+ / 0-)

   From Wkipedia:

   In each episode, instead of animal senses and cunning, Wile E. Coyote
   uses absurdly complex contraptions and elaborate plans to pursue his
   quarry.

   Wile E. Coyote often obtains complex and ludicrous devices from a
   mail-order company, the fictitious Acme Corporation, which he hopes
   will help him catch the Road Runner. The devices invariably fail in
   improbable and spectacular ways. Whether this is result of operator
   error or faulty merchandise is debatable. The coyote usually ends up
   burnt to a crisp, squashed flat, or at the bottom of a canyon.
   Occasionally Acme products do work quite well. In this case their
   success often works against the coyote.

   How the coyote acquires these products without money is not explained
   until the 2003 movie Looney Tunes: Back in Action, in which he is shown
   to be...an employee of Acme!!!

   Replace Wile E. Coyote by Republicans, Road Runner by Obama, and Acme
   by Corporate America, and you have the exact current situation in

   ...sure says "action" to me.  Glad to see the party leadership has its
   priorities straight.  Perhaps an Obamaquester golf outing would help
   further drive the point (whatever it is, exactly) home.

 Meh, Obama still gets a huge amount of blame ([809]0+ / 0-)

   The public blames the GOP a bit more, but opinion doesn't even remotely
   reflect reality.

 Isn't it amusing ([812]0+ / 0-)

   that Lynn, the CPA, Jenkins is always among Boner's background in these
   photos. She is supposedly my Representative and only lives three blocks
   or so from me. When first elected, her husband waited until the day
   after the election to file for divorce. She was sleeping with her
   campaign manager. Not that I'm judging here, but it makes me wonder who
   she's doing these days.

   he that dares not reason is a slave." -- William Drummond of
   Hawthornedenne (13 December 1585 - 4 December 1649), Scottish poet.

 Well, ([815]0+ / 0-)

   it IS, after all, the Orange Man's baby. Maybe he is having postpartum
   depression these days!

   Being "pro-life" means believing that every child born has a right to
   food, education, and access to health care.
