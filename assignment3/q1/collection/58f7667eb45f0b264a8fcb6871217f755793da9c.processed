[23]Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest: Say what? Scott Brown might run for
Senate in New Hampshire?!

   Leading Off:

   o NH-Sen: This sounds like something that was supposed to come out on
   April Fool's Day but got stuck in the pipeline. Scott Brown, the former
   half-term Republican senator from Massachusetts, is floating his name
   for a new Senate race... [32]in New Hampshire. It's not entirely clear
   whether he brought up the idea himself, or if someone else prompted the
   question after he stated at a New Hampshire appearance on Thursday that
   he was "likely not done with politics," but in either case, he said
   he's "not going to rule out anything right now."

   My assumption based on his most recent moves--such as [33]filling in
   for Bill O'Reilly on Fox News the other day--was that he wasn't going
   to run for anything in 2014, including the most obvious choice of
   MA-Gov (the one slot where Bay Staters have shown some willingness to
   vote Republican).

   But Brown may well truly want to find a way back into the Senate,
   whatever the method. With that in mind, New Hampshire does have a 2014
   race for a Dem-held seat; the swingy Granite State is more receptive to
   moderate Republicanism than Massachusetts; and most of New Hampshire
   shares a media market with Boston, so name rec shouldn't be a problem.
   (In fact, a good number of people who work in Boston and would actually
   like to vote for Brown probably already live one state to the north:
   ex-Massholes who have fled the state for the lure of lower taxes.)
   However, that would put him on a collision course with Jeanne Shaheen,
   who's no pushover. She's one of New Hampshire's most popular
   politicians and is favored for re-election--though a Brown candidacy
   would certainly scramble the calculus.

   So the next logical question is: "If the stars align in such a bizarre
   way to elect Scott Brown again, would that make him the first-ever
   senator to represent two different states?" The answer, in fact, is no,
   not by a long shot. Several senators have already done that--perhaps
   most famously Daniel Webster, who represented the exact same two states
   in question (though he served New Hampshire in the House). Indeed, one
   senator, [34]James Shields, represented three different states
   (Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri) in the Senate between 1849 and
   1879. But this practice has become increasingly rare (in the House, for
   instance, it was only accomplished [35]three times in the 20th
   century), so Brown would find himself in extremely unusual territory if
   he went ahead with such a move.

   Senate:

   o IA-Sen: With each passing week, it seems like Republican Rep. Steve
   King's feet get a little colder regarding the open Iowa Senate seat,
   which would at least potentially be winnable for a skilled moderate
   Republican but would be a kamikaze mission for a nutter like him. King
   even acknowledged his own difficulties in recent comments on Iowa
   public TV, saying it would be a "[36]slightly uphill battle" for him
   since Iowa's "turned a little to the left." [37]He added that "I need
   to get a decision made pretty quickly" out of respect for other
   potential GOP candidates Kim Reynolds and Bill Northey. Cumulatively,
   those quotes don't make him sound very candidate-ish.

   o MA-Sen: This may be too little too late for Stephen Lynch, who staked
   out the right flank in the Democratic primary for the Massachusetts
   Senate special election and is now finding out that there just aren't
   enough votes there for a path to victory. Lynch is now toying with
   [38]flip-flopping on his support for the Keystone XL pipeline, which is
   one of the key differences he has with Ed Markey and also one of the
   main reasons why major enviro groups are backing Markey instead. Maybe
   most significantly, environmental issues are what's driven billionaire
   Tom Steyer to spend over $200,000 so far on defeating Lynch.

   At this point, Lynch has only opened the door to dropping support for
   the pipeline and hasn't formally reversed course, but even if he did,
   the special primary is coming up soon (April 30), and his die is
   already cast as the less-eco-friendly candidate. It also might diminish
   enthusiasm for him from the hard-hat unions, many of which support the
   pipeline construction from a jobs-and-infrastructure angle. It's really
   a no-win situation for Lynch... but then, it's been one ever since he
   inexplicably got in the race in the first place.

   o MI-Sen: Debbie Dingell is reportedly taking "[39]concrete steps"
   toward a Senate run to replace the retiring Carl Levin, according to
   Politico. While Dingell--the wife of Rep. John Dingell, who hasn't held
   political office but is a Dem insider in her own right and a former
   General Motors exec--says that she's still "genuinely undecided," she
   is doing her due diligence. That means putting together a consulting
   team featuring a couple of big names and meeting with labor groups and
   EMILY's List (the latter of whom would probably be key to her winning a
   primary against Rep. Gary Peters). (Also, check out the picture of her
   at the link... she also seems to be working on her [40]Carl Levin-style
   look, at least in terms of her eyeglasses and facial expression.)

   o NJ-Sen: Don't start coronating Cory Booker for the open New Jersey
   Senate seat just yet: Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone just popped up
   again to remind us that he's "[41]very interested" in the race. We
   haven't heard much from Pallone since his name first got floated in the
   wake of Frank Lautenberg's retirement, but this is probably his
   strongest statement of interest so far, saying he's "pursuing that and
   working on it on a daily basis." Booker's star power will be difficult
   to overcome, but it seems like Pallone's gauging whether there's enough
   space on Booker's left to carve out a viable path to the nomination.

   Gubernatorial:

   o IL-Gov: Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn doesn't seem to grok that his
   approvals have him down in dead-candidate-walking territory, such that
   he might actually be at risk of losing to a Republican in this blue
   state (not that it really matters since he'd probably be just a speed
   bump for AG Lisa Madigan in a Democratic primary). Yet Quinn's actions
   indicate that he's still fully intending to run for re-election, since
   he's going [42]full speed ahead on the fundraising front. After ending
   2012 with only about $1 million in campaign funds, he raised $550,000
   in the first quarter of the year, with much of that coming from
   organized labor.

   House:

   o CA-20: Nothing says pure excitement more than "Leon Panetta." But now
   that he seems to have retired for good after holding every single
   possible job in the Beltway at various points, it's time for...
   [43]another Panetta. Leon's son James, a Monterey County assistant DA
   and a former Naval Intelligence officer, is floating his name for the
   House seat held long ago by his dad, once Sam Farr (who took over in
   1993 after Panetta left to head OMB) retires. One slight catch: Farr
   hasn't expressed any interest in actually, you know, retiring, though
   he is 71 years old.

   Other Races:

   o Charlotte Mayor: When I saw "Foxx" and "North Carolina" in one place,
   my first instinct was that Virginia Foxx was retiring! Unfortunately,
   we aren't so lucky. Instead, Anthony Foxx, the up-and-coming mayor of
   Charlotte, announced that he [44]won't be running for re-election this
   year. Foxx, who is African-American and 41 years old, was first elected
   in 2009. He's gotten mostly good notices as mayor, so it's not a
   question of being endangered. Rather, recent scuttlebutt has him on the
   short list to become Transportation secretary in Barack Obama's second
   term, so an announcement on that may be forthcoming soon.

   [45]Possible Democratic candidates here include Jennifer Roberts, the
   Mecklenburg County Commissioner who acquitted herself well in the open
   seat NC-09 race last year; City Councilor and Mayor-pro-tem Patrick
   Cannon; City Councilor David Howard; and state Sen. Dan Clodfelter. On
   the Republican side, ex-City Councilor and 2009 loser John Lassiter may
   try again, and City Councilor Edwin Peacock could also run.

   Grab Bag:

   o House: Maybe it was last week's Quinnipiac poll (which had a generic
   ballot of D+8) that suddenly got everyone to realize that polls are
   showing the Democrats hovering around the point where, if the numbers
   hold up, they might retake control of the House in 2014. (Rasmussen,
   weirdly, has been putting up those kinds of numbers routinely for
   months now, though I certainly won't fault you for not wanting to hang
   your hat entirely on Scotty's predictions.)

   Think Progress's Ian Millhiser concludes, based on 2012 margins in
   individual House races, that Democrats would win a [46]five-seat
   majority if this D+8 margin held, while other pundits have looked
   instead at [47]Alan Abramowitz's model, which would require an ungodly
   D+13 on the generic ballot to flip the House.

   The New Republic's Nate Cohn came out with a [48]characteristically
   judicious piece on Friday, skeptical of whether the outlier-ish
   Quinnipiac poll of registered voters is that reliable, but also
   supposing that it would take significantly less than D+8 to flip the
   House. That's based on the role of open seats but also more generally
   on the lack of a uniform swing (as seen in the general trend that seats
   on the cusp mostly tend to fall in the same direction amidst a wave
   year).

   However, as a final splash of cold water, there's also the wee matter,
   of course, of whether the Dems can actually sustain a D+8 for the next
   year and a half. Kyle Kondik [49]points out that at this point in 2009,
   the generic ballot was running at D+4! (And we know how that movie
   turned out.)

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [82]Civil
   Rights, [83]Community, [84]Congress, [85]Culture, [86]Economy,
   [87]Education, [88]Elections, [89]Energy, [90]Environment, [91]Health
   Care, [92]International, [93]Labor, [94]Law, [95]Media, [96]Meta,
   [97]National Security, [98]Science, [99]Transportation, or [100]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([101]California, [102]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there
   are many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   I live on the North Shore of Mass. Why? My wife and I originally
   looked in NH and came to the conclusion that the no income tax status
   would cause us to pay more in taxes.

   Ten years ago, homes that were around $300K had property taxes in
   excess of $10K. The home we bought in Mass. for $450K had taxes around
   $5K.

       if you have no income or sales tax in NH, but want a functioning
       school system and local government, as most border towns do.
       Propaganda to the contrary, the basic rule that public services
       have to be paid for continues to apply, even within the sainted
       boundaries of New Hampshire.
       About 2 years ago I was stuck with a guy from Wakefield at a party.
       He kept telling me how Obama was a socialist and he was moving to
       NH to get away from taxes in Mass. I asked if he was planning to
       give up his job two blocks from North Station as part of this plan.
       "No," he says, "I have a great job in Boston. Why would I do that?"
       Because, dumbass, if you continue to work in Mass. you'll pay Mass.
       income tax ANYWAY, plus double the property tax, and you'll triple
       your commute. But otherwise, good plan.

 One Way or Another You Pay Taxes ([184]2+ / 0-)

       In CA we  have just about the lowest property taxes in the US with
       most homeowners paying just 1% on the purchase price, plus a tiny
       raise each year if the house appreciates. We also have among the
       highest sales and personal income taxes in the nation. Ideally
       there should be balance, because as it is low incomes are way over
       paying in sales and income taxes while the rich and businesses
       shield their valuable property from taxes.

   more effective and experienced Dems. And it would really help their

 Kevin Strouse Not Ready. ([249]2+ / 0-)

   OK...so we learned last week Kevin Strouse is a candidate for PA-08.
   And today we learn he is still doing research to form [252]opinions on
   the issues.

   First of all if he was not ready to formulate opinions in the issues,
   maybe he could have waited 6 months before announcing his candidacy and
   giving an embarrassing interview to the Washington Post. Of course WaPo
   is in love with the centrist gobbledygook; apparently Democrats' new
   branding strategy is "polite problem-solvers" (gag!), so this is all
   framed as a positive for Strouse.

   As I have said repeatedly here, moderates are fine and centrists are
   shysters. It is legitimate for congresscritters to genuinely hold
   moderate beliefs (moderates),  but it is not OK for congresscritters to
   compromise for the sake of compromising whatever the policy
   consequences (centrists).

   NH republicans are some far right crazies but luckily independents and

 about my state's primaries ([278]0+ / 0-)
       My home state of New Hampshire has a semi-open primary:
       independents (whom we Granite Staters call "Undeclareds") can vote
       in either primary.  An undeclared has the right to join one party
       or the other for at least the few minutes it takes to fill out the
       ballot. Sometimes they forget to change back to Undeclared (which
       they can do after they hand in their ballots) and end up being
       stuck for two years in a party they only wanted to join for those
       few minutes.  In 2014, we will probably have more accidental
       Republicans than accidental Democrats, thanks to the 2012
       Presidential Primary (although the Democratic state primary did
       feature a lively governor's race.)
       NH is famous for the First in the Nation Presidential Primary, but
       it has one of the latest state primaries.  Unless the legislature
       changes the election laws (unlikely though not inconceivable) the
       primary date is the second Tuesday of each even-numbered year, i.e.
       September 9, 2014.  This makes for a rather short general election
       campaign: usually eight weeks (and every 14th year we have a 7-week
       general election campaign.)

   or would it give the few remaining "moderate" Republicans a reason to

       She's been the Democratic leader for a while, sure, but she doesn't

       like the job is hers until she decides.
       But if she didn't step aside after this last election, let alone
       after 2010, is she really likely to do so just when she'd have the
       chance to be Speaker again?  (...and with a Democratic Senate and
       President! I'm pretty sure she would like to finally get a climate
       bill signed, for instance.)
       I completely agree with you about Boehner, though; this is the end
       of the line for him.  Speaker or no, if they lose seats in 2014 he
       will not be keeping the wolves out any longer.  Maybe if they

 Many different reasons. ([397]0+ / 0-)
       The biggest single issue is the budget, and that feeds multiple
       side issues.
       [398]Quinn championed doubling the corporate tax rate to 7% and
       increasing the Illinois personal income tax rate from 3% to 5% to
       balance the budget.  That passed the legislature.  Guess whether
       the budget is balanced?  People are rightly pissed off that a big
       promise was not delivered.
       That leads into the second biggest issue - his fight with AFSCME
       over the state worker contract.  IMHO, AFSCME is not covered in
       glory here either - they struck for and got guaranteed 4% raises in
       2008 - a year when people were pretty raw over losing jobs left and
       right.  This fed a "unions suck" mentality.  Quinn by any standard
       has deeply fucked up the [399]renegotiation.  Remember how the
       budget wasn't balanced?
       The state pension plan has been explicitly underfunded by all
       governors for decades.  The fact that this policy is bipartisan and
       longstanding does not stop it from crushing the current occupant of
       the seat.  Illinois is short [400]97B from what they should have.
       Notice how the SEC also called them out for misleading bond
       incvestors.
       So the short answer is that on the one thing that he HAD to do -
       balance the budget, he deeply fucked it up, and that shit is
       splashing everywhere.

 newsworthy? ([407]0+ / 0-)

   So many articles on Scott Brown...he replied to a question about
   running in NH saying that "he would not rule it out". Is that really
   worthy of front page articles in Boston Globe, NY Times, Washington
   Post, and Daily Kos?
   Seems like kind of small potatoes to me.

 It's definitely worth the ink . . . ([410]0+ / 0-)
       . . . because it gets our side motivated and willing to donate our
       money and time, which could either scare him out of running or,
       should he end up the nominee, vanquish him more easily. We've
       learned from the Coakley debacle, so any rumblings of a Brown
       candidacy have a galvanizing effect on the left, to make sure it
       never happens again!

 Remember when the Republicans ([417]0+ / 0-)

   were outraged at that carpetbagger, Hillary Clinton, moving to a
   different state than the one she was from to run for office, because
   that different state is more receptive to her party than the one she
   was from?

   Seems like a good time to remind them of that.

 I don't think it's unprecedented ([420]0+ / 0-)

   State political machines tend to follow state lines, which is why this
   doesn't happen more frequently.  With big money politics, my guess is
   that this will start to become more common, especially in places like
   New England, which is becoming close to one big media market.

 I beg to differ. ([423]0+ / 0-)
       New England is small geographically, but media markets be damned.

 I don't know why... ([427]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [428]The Caped Composer

   People speculated about Scott Brown for governor. They actually have to
   work and govern. It is obvious that Scott Brown wants to be John McCain
   type. Do some interviews with Fox Morning, grab breakfast with a king
   or queen, and then spend the afternoon calling in to Boston Sports
   radio.

 Because Massachusetts is MUCH more receptive ([431]0+ / 0-)
       to a Republican Governor than a Republican Senator. Between 1991
       and 2007, literally every Governor of Massachusetts was a
       Republican. Before Brown's victory in 2010, the last time a
       Republican won a Senate election in MA was Ed Brooke in 1972.
       There is a theory that many in MA like the idea of a Republican
       Governor to balance out the heavily Democratic legislature. Scott
       Brown being a supposed "moderate" would fit that perfectly.
       That's why he has been speculated for Governor.

 Problem with that theory ([435]0+ / 0-)

     There is a theory that many in MA like the idea of a Republican
     Governor to balance out the heavily Democratic legislature.
       is that our [436]nominally heavily Democratic [437]legislature is
       [438]close to [439]useless for [440]progressive purposes.
       Republicans...think the American standard of living is a fine
       thing--so long as it doesn't spread to all the people. And they
       admire the Government of the United States so much that they would
       like to buy it. Harry S. Truman

 I'm not questioning that, ([444]0+ / 0-)
       But it is pretty obvious that Scott Brown isn't really a nose to
       the grindstone governor type. He's more celebrity Senator. I think
       he knows that.
       Was this all just a case of, "hey the governorship will be open;
       Scott Brown isn't doing anything, I bet he'll run"?
       Pretty lazy speculation there that can really be made only by
       someone who hasn't watched Brown in action.
       Given the choice of running a state or being a Fox celebrity and
       part-time celebrity lawyer, my analysis always said Brown would
       take the easy way out.

 Scott Brown's career is OVER ([448]0+ / 0-)

   I've mentioned this MANY times already.  Brown really screwed up when
   he was attacking Elizabeth Warren for her Native-American heritage.
   And he hasn't apologized since.

   This evidence is going to dog Brown no matter what office he runs for
   so long as he doesn't apologize.

   by [449]pipsorcle on [450]Mon Apr 08, 2013 at 12:01:59 PM PDT



 regarding Brown... ([451]0+ / 0-)

   ...has there ever been a U.S. Senator who lost reelection in one state
   and later was elected to the Senate from another?

   To the best of my knowledge that has not occurred. Not that it matters,
   per se.

   However, as a New Yorker who supported Hillary Clinton's run for
   Senate, despite charges against her of being a "carpetbagger," it seems
   to me that Brown has a lot more to overcome than just being called a
   "carpetbagger."
   He would also have to overcome the additional baggage that he was a
   carpetbagger who was fired from office by his own constituents.

   In fact, the ad makes itself (for the Democratic candidate):
   Why would New Hampshire want to send someone to the U.S. Senate who was
   fired from his job as Senator by his previous constituents? Maybe he
   thinks our standards are lower here?
