   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   States' Wrongs

   As crazy as Washington is these days, at least the batty Republican
   bills are being kept at bay by the Senate and, if necessary, the
   president's veto pen. But in GOP-controlled state legislatures, it's
   dumbstick central, like this North Carolina gem that [29]got the green
   light from a senate committee:
   Close-up of rocks
   Microscopic view
   of GOP brain cells.

     The plan is for welfare applicants in North Carolina to foot the
     $100 or more for the [mandatory drug] testing upfront, then get
     reimbursed if they passed. WRAL says no one could say where the
     money for reimbursements would come from.  [...]

     "You're OK with (drug users) getting federal dollars if they've had
     a doobie and get the munchies and need more food stamps?" [GOP state
     Senator Tommy] Tucker asked.

   Please update your definition of "smaller government" to include peeing
   in a cup for Nurse Ratched if you happen to be down and out in North
   Carolina. And have a nice day.

   Cheers and Jeers starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!]

   Cheers and Jeers for Wednesday, April 10, 2013

   Note: The Payson Park Penis Painting Festival planned for this weekend
   has been cancelled on account of what the city calls "decency laws."

   CHEERS to locking and loading.  Two apparently big guns crafting
   responsible firearms ownership legislation appear to be [34]ready to
   fire the starting pistol:
   The Ancient Roman Senate
   The U.S. Senate in action.
   (Drunk artist rendering)

     Sen. Pat Toomey is close to a deal with Sen. Joe Manchin on
     background checks for gun show and Internet gun sales, his office
     said Tuesday night.

     A Toomey spokesperson on Tuesday told NBC News that the two senators
     have agreed on all but the final details of a compromise.  Manchin
     told reporters Tuesday that the compromise would close the gun show
     loophole by mandating background checks for those transactions and
     also require background checks for all Internet gun sales.

   I'm also hearing that Republicans won't have enough votes to launch a
   filibuster, so that obnoxious hurdle appears to be disappearing.  By
   the way, Toomey and Manchin plan to start their presser this morning
   with a few light jokes.  You might say they'll be pistols at dawn.

   JEERS to the Littlest Dicktator.  North Korea says its missiles [35]are
   loaded.  And judging by his erratic and clumsy behavior, so is their
   leader.

   CHEERS to today's special guest C&Jer.  We cede the floor to our
   lab-mix puppy, Haley, who blogs here (or anywhere!) for the first time:

     JEERS to Bill in Portland Maine & Common Sense Mainer.  They're
     taking me to the vet today to get me carved up like a Christmas ham
     and end my ability to extend my family line.  Damn them.  Damn them
     to hell forever.  Or at least until the next time they feed me, in
     which case I LOVE MY DADDIES I LOVE MY DADDIES!!!!!  But not today.
      Oh, definitely not today.

   Seventeen weeks old and already a drama queen.

   CHEERS to saving the best for last.  The men having gotten their silly
   little Nerf basketball tournament out of the way Monday, last night it
   was time for the rock 'em, sock 'em finale: the Women's Division I NCAA
   Battle Royale.  And the champs are the UConn Huskies, in a [37]93-60
   chomp-a-stomp over Louisville.  And now that this year's March Madness
   is all over, it's time to take the final step: you must print out your
   brackets and eat them.  [MunchMunchMunch...gulp!]  We'll speak no more
   of it.

   JEERS to a teeny tiny little oversight.  It's bad enough that the most
   sophisticated technology the oil companies have for cleaning up from
   pipeline breaks is paper towels.  But now Big Oil's cousin, Nukular, is
   creating a [38]bit of a radioactive stir over this:
   Homer Simpson asleep on the job at nuke plant.

     All 104 nuclear power reactors now in operation in the United States
     have a safety problem that cannot be fixed and they should be
     replaced with newer technology, the former chairman of the Nuclear
     Regulatory Commission said on Monday.  Shutting them all down at
     once is not practical, he said, but he supports phasing them out
     rather than trying to extend their lives.

   A spokesman for the nuclear industry lobby responded by saying,
   "Nothing to see here, everything's fine, go back to your homes, please
   move along."  It probably would've sounded more credible if he hadn't
   slurred it through the tentacle where his face used to be.

   JEERS to non-refundable tickets.  On April 10, 1912, the unsinkable RMS
   Titanic set off for New York from Southampton, England.  That cruise
   turned out to be a disaster.  The caviar was much too salty.

   -

   Five years ago in C&J: April 10, 2008

   CHEERS to John and Jane Q. Public.  A USA Today/Gallup poll shows that
   [39]60 percent of your neighbors want Congress to establish a timetable
   for withdrawal from Iraq...and stick to it no matter what happens in
   Iraq.  Your assignment: find the 40 percent that don't.  And check
   their pulse.

   JEERS to Kellogg, Brown & Root.  Another female employee of the
   controversial private contractor (and former Halliburton-Cheney
   subsidiary) has come forward to say that male  thugs of the company
   [40]raped her in Iraq.  A KBR spokesman says that, in light of the
   growing scandal, they intend to deal with the problem quickly and
   decisively.  Starting today all female employees overseas will be
   issued chastity belts.  How thoughtful.

   And just one more...

   CHEERS to Jotter: International Man of Mojo.  And here we are again:
   April 10.  A date which will live in Jotterfamy.  Yes, today is the
   annual rite of spring (the other being the running of the tutu-clad
   man-goats---we'll post those photos shortly) known as We Love Jotter
   Day.  Day in and day out, this blog's equivilent of a George
   Clooney-Paul Krugman hybrid lords over a room full of MIT-educated
   jotterangutans with abacuses who work furiously to rank the previous
   day's most popular posts (formerly known as diaries) using a
   measurement---the "bharns," named after yours truly because my bribe
   was bigger than yours---and keeping track of the death spiral of Daily
   Kos by posting the ever-growing number of new user registrations
   (758,589 as of yesterday) for public consumption.  So watch for today's
   [41]High Impact Posts post, tip and rec, and post a comment
   congratulating Jotter for another year of fine jottering.  Because if
   he ever decides to take his algorithms and go home, we're fucked.

   Have a jotterrrrrrific Wednesday!  Floor's open...What are you cheering
   and jeering about today?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [56]Tagging tips - [57]Search For Tags - [58]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [59]Civil
   Rights, [60]Community, [61]Congress, [62]Culture, [63]Economy,
   [64]Education, [65]Elections, [66]Energy, [67]Environment, [68]Health
   Care, [69]International, [70]Labor, [71]Law, [72]Media, [73]Meta,
   [74]National Security, [75]Science, [76]Transportation, or [77]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([78]California, [79]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       8 weeks is old enough these days. They've found that it doesn't
       affect growth or maturing in any way, so, snip away!
       fwiw, the same is true for both cats & dogs. Many shelters will now
       spay/neuter BEFORE you can bring them home-even at 7-8 weeks. Lil
       Chris got that deal--spayed before I could leave the shelter with
       her...at 8 weeks old.

       Bailey, pre-pounce
       The surgery gets more dangerous and complicated after they enter
       their first heat, so it's best to do it as early as possible.
       But, it's better for them - extends their life and greatly reduces
       the risk for some cancers.
       (As I was looking through my album for this pic, it's hard to
       believe Bailey's been gone almost already as long as she was alive.
       Lost her to lymphoma in 2009. )

   to the doctor for "the operation."

   Or, as we ladies down here in Texas say, when we have to deal with the
   little darlings, "the brain operation."

   I once, while watching a colt of mine get gelded, ask the vet what he
   did with the discards. "Well, I usually take 'em home for my dogs.  But
   one lady wanted 'em. I asked her why. She said, "I'm going to nail them
   to the door inside his stall. So every morning, when this
   son-of-a-bitch wakes up, they'll be the first thing he sees!"

   Ouch.

   I suppose it could fall under "backache", because that's where the
   disks are, but when it hit me it was in the left leg socket.  Like
   having a power drill stuck in it. An easy 8 at least on the 1-10 scale
   (10 being kidney stones, and 14 being the 24-hour labor a friend of

   Ooooo, early today! That's great because I have a funeral to play at 2
   in Yarmouth, so I'm going to be on my way out in a little bit (gotta
   get an early start, I've got Geoffrey).

   CHEERS to family and friends.

   CHEERS to Jotter. He does a lot of work that doesn't get a lot of eyes,
   but I love to look at his high impact posts because more often than
   not, I discover I've missed something everyone else--apparently--has
   seen. It takes dedication to put that together every day. We should be
   grateful.

   JEERS to austerity and chained CPI: if I wanted to live in Mexico, you
   know, I'd like move there.

   JEERS to sequestration "trickling down" to public broadcasting: last
   week MPBN announced that they've laid off the crew of Mainewatch and
   suspended the program indefinitely. Tomorrow is our famous one-day fund
   drive. If you live or vacation in Maine, you can give a great public
   broadcasting system a couple of bucks [1201]here.

   CHEERS to legendmn who has a birthday today. He is exactly one year
   younger than me to the day, and much better looking. Give him some
   love.

   CHEERS to BiPM, CSM and of course all of you. Happy Wednesday!

       So far so good. I just played a memorial service at church, so I've
       walked in the door a couple of hundred dollars heavier than I
       walked out. While I'm sorry for the family of the deceased, it was
       nice to have extra work. Great birthday present, that it should be

   no doorknob on the door. Wind had blown it shut. Thank heavens the kids
   found a screwdriver in the chaos to rescue me!

   For that matter, Cheers to kids and Cheers to doorknobs. Where would we

   or a German who is leaving home?

   I love Germany -- I was hoping that my husband would get assigned
   there, but we went to Tokyo instead. A year later, the company moved
   someone else to Germany. Sigh.

   We went to Germany for our honeymoon. We just moved from town to town,
   stopping anyplace that seemed interesting. In Heidelberg we met a ton
   of people at the train station scanning the bulletin boards for
   hostels. They said they couldn't find a room in Munich, so they just
   stopped in every town along the train looking for a place to stay. That
   was our next stop, so my husband started calling every hotel and after
   a dozen or so places laughed at him and hung up, he finally secured a
   room at a Holiday Inn.

   We asked the concierge in Munich about things we should do and she said
   "you mean other than Oktoberfest?" Well, that certainly explains why it
   was so hard to get a room... Who knew that Oktoberfest isn't in
   October, but in September "because of better weather"?  I always wanted
   to go to Oktoberfest -- how weird that we just wandered into it!

   So welcome to New England! I'm not in Maine, but relatively nearby in
   the Boston area...

       I'm coming back to New England. I didn't grow up here in Maine, but
       over the years my family has sort of settled in the Portland area.
       It was a tough decision for me - it's a lot easier to be a
       socialist in Germany. But I am optimistic that I well meet plenty
       of sensible left wing folks in real life here too.

   I can't think of the name of it, but just drive down Water Street in
   Hallowell and look for the place with the Buddhas and gargoyles.

   It's full of all kinds of lighting fixtures -- we were looking for a
   ceiling fixture a porch we had built on our c. 1770-1795 home and found
   the perfect one there.

   Plan to enjoy a meal while you're in Hallowell -- you'll have a lot of
   restaurants to choose from.  And if you time it right, there will
   probably be a lot of music offerings as well.

   Hallowell: a nice drinking town with a small antiques problem.

   I just hate the heat! Nirvana is 50 degrees, blue jeans, and an Irish
   knit sweater. Add in some colorful trees reflected in a lake and
   mountains in the background, and that would be my version of heaven.

   However, I do like to have some days in the 70's because then I can
   drive my little red convertible, which is also nirvana...

   Wow, 90's in April is a bit scary...

       It's a little treat after weeks of dreary gray skies and cold.

   Seems like we've gone from the end of winter straight to summer here in
   the Philadelphia 'burbs. Car thermometer (usually fairly accurate)
   registered 87 degrees at one point yesterday afternoon. Resisting
   turning on the AC but may give in today..... Forecast for tomorrow is a
   much nicer 66 degrees.

   Cheers to wonderful friends! Off to spend the day with one of them....

   Cheers to sorting through stuff. Pack-rat tendencies are hard to
   combat, but I'm trying......

   Cheers to the wee beasties. They don't seem any happier with the heat
   than I am :-( Although Hobbs was happy that I opened the side window in
   the den (can't remember the last time I did), as that gave him a new
   view to enjoy..... Hobbs enjoying his more usual living room view:

   CHEERS to Bill & Michael in PWM, our guest hosts including
   [2494]commonmass along with Geoffrey the Cat ...... and all of you here
   at C&J.

   ART NOTES - an ambitious festival of [2495]Cambodian arts - with more
   than 125 artists of different disciplines, performing or exhibiting in
   30 New York institutions (from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the
   Asia Society) - entitled [2496]Season of Cambodia takes place from now
   until July 7th.

                    [2497][AndInCambodia_zpsc5987c52.png]

   CHEERS to the twenty-two year old Norwegian [2498]Magnus Carlsen - who
   will compete in the world chess title series (against defending
   champion Viswanathan Anand) this autumn.

   THEN and NOW - in July 1969, the Rolling Stones gave a free concert in
   London's [2499]Hyde Park - just two days after the death of Brian Jones
   - and will perform there [2500]this coming July (nearly forty-four
   years to the day) ... although not for free.

   HAPPY TRAILS to the veteran Broadway/cabaret singer [2501]Elaine
   Stritch
   - perhaps best known for her version of the song [2502]Ladies who Lunch
   by Stephen Sondheim - who has retired from performing at age 88.

   WEDNESDAY's CHILD is [2503]Simba the Cat - a Maine kitteh being
   recognized for his dozen years as a high school mascot, then returns to
   his home each night.

   THREE YEARS AGO after New Hampshire legalized same-sex marriage, I
   noted that several town meetings considered non-binding resolutions
   opposing it: but most either rejected or tabled them. Then, residents
   of the [2505]Town of Plainfield (1/2 hour south of me) not only
   rejected it, but adopted a resolution to send a letter to the state
   legislature thanking them. There was one money quote at Town Meeting -
   by the mother of a straight son and a lesbian daughter - who said "Gay
   and lesbian people suffer not because of who they are but because of
   who we are".

   I didn't realize it at the time, but that woman was [2506]Gretchen
   Cherington - whose gay daughter happens to be indie rocker [2507]Molly
   Cherington and whose straight son happens to be [2508]Ben Cherington -
   the general manager of the Boston Red Sox for the past year-and-a-half.
   She must be one proud woman.

   SEPARATED at BIRTH - Denver Broncos (and former Carolina Panthers)
   coach [2509]John Fox as well as [2510]Grady Little - the former Red
   Sox/Dodgers manager.

       because they were introduced across the state by adherents of
       anti-equality groups. Most never came close to passing, if I
       recall.
       I enjoyed being one of the people who stayed up into the wee hours
       of our town's Deliberative Session (did I mention Jeers to SB 2?!!)
       in order to assist the process of amending our warrant article on
       this subject into nonexistence. A local man who had recently been
       married made an excellent speech, and the article was soundly
       rebuffed, even here in the red zone.

   Jeers to the fact I "overslept" this morning by 30 minutes which meant
   I caught some of the beginning of the big thunderstorms that are
   blowing thru here.

   Cheers that despite the lightning and thunder, I didn't get rained on
   to the point of being drenched.

   Jeers to finding a tick attached to me this morning.  That's from
   gardening in the flower/shrub beds at the [2990]Dauphine yesterday.

   Cheers to having DirectTV since their added channels for Masters
   coverage is a godsend for Masters crack addicts like me.

   Cheers to stretching kittehs:
   [img0350tg.jpg]
   Last evening I picked up Catterina from out back and deposited her in
   her bed.  She moved just enough to stretch out like this.  She's had a
   slow spring.  Of course Mom keeps saying "there's something wrong with
   her" but Mom has been saying that about our cats for a decade and she's
   right about 25% of the time.  Catty drinks a lot of water and sits
   around a bunch but at 12 (we got her 10 years ago and estimated she was
   2 at the time) we expect her to slow down.  Last year we had blood work
   done on her and yeah, she's got some early signs of kidney problems so
   who knows.  She seems happy enough in that bizzaro torbie way which
   means she looks less perturbed than usual.

       Over here in far, far northern MA, my housemate found one the other
       day!  It's a bit early in the season for the little blighters, and
       it's been so cold this year....we are a bit concerned.
       Scritchies and purrs to Catterina.  My old boy, HisLordshipOfSnooze
       ( guess what he's doing now? )  is  a diabetic, so I'm familiar
       with the issues.  Wet catfood seems to be a good idea for many
       older cats.  This old bugger is on the expensive stuff from the
       vet, but I've heard that Fancy Feast is a good alternative.  ymmv.
       Happy in that bizzaro torbie way.....ain't it da truth!

   Because I'm likely to have one more often than the others and NOTHING
   helps. Toothache usually subsides with a few days of (VERY) dilute tea
   tree oil swishing.

   Cheers to not having any of those aches today.
   Jeers to having a strained muscle under my shoulder blade.

   Cheers to the Asheville DK meetup next weekend (the 20th)! Can't wait
   to meet DKer's for the first time in reallife.

   Cheers to heading off today for a few days at Edisto Beach, SC.

   Cheers to being in love with the same person since 1990. And

   Jeers to no Facebook!

   Cheers to the line of diligent masons and tree people and plumbers who
   have marched through our house, but jeers to the total confusion over
   whose estimate and how much we find ourselves in.

   Jeers to waking up to another jolting nightmare.  Ugh.  Woke me up too
   early.

   Cheers to the daffodils finally blooming!

   Jeers to creeping boredom.  Between the whooping cough and the sinuses,
   I've been stuck at home more or less since November.  Bleah.

   Cheers to finding enough summer stuff to keep me going through these
   two hot days.

   And cheers to all of us, 'cause we rock!

   although backache is a close tie.

   Backache can reduce me to tears very quickly and make me stop whatever
   I'm doing - but passes fairly quickly compared to a headache, which for
   me is a migraine - often a three day affair (currently on day three of
   one).  Neither are any fun.

       I tend to worry, too, and it is as useless as teats on a hen.

   The only thing that made a dent was Percodan, and that was only if I
   could get one down before the nausea kicked in.

   Then my sister suggested I try chiropractic.  If only I had gone ten
   years earlier -- those damned headaches cost me a good year and a half
   of my life.

   The only fond memory I have of those days is the occasional realization
   that "I don't have a headache!  I can roll my eyes this way and that
   and -- nothing!"

   I do hope you are having one of those moments right now ...

   more people fear toothaches than any other ache; when was the last time
   the doctor told you, "I don't think we're going to be able to save that
   ear?"

   "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."........ "The test of

   the North Carolina legislature:

   [3635]The idiotic one descreibed by BiPM (and Tommy Tucker is my
   Senator, a former small-town council member, former county
   commissioner, and perhaps the crookedest politician in North Carolina
   who "built" his HVAC business into a multimillion-dollar operation by
   pushing local policies that benefited developers and homebuilders and
   receiving their [DEL: undying loyalty :DEL] business in return

   [3636]The Nipple Bill... He said "areola!"

   [3637]The "Crazy People Needs Gunz Too" Act that eliminates sheriffs'
   authority to conduct mental health background checks on concealed gun
   applicants

   [3638]The "It Ain't Broke but We're Gonna Break It" Act, stripping the
   city of Charlotte of control of its $2 billion airport and creating an
   "authority" made up of Republican-appointed hacks from surrounding
   [DEL: rural :DEL] cow counties because the Repukes don't like
   Charlotte's Democratic African-American mayor

   [3639]The "We Love Big Central Gummint Control as Long as We Are the
   Big Central Gummint" Act, which strips local governments and planning
   boards from having any control over building design in their
   jurisdictions

   and, in the "you just can't make this stuff up" department, [3640]The
   "North Carolina is a Christian State and We Gonna Haves Us Our State
   Relijun" Act, with 14 cosponsors (this one was actually squashed in
   committee by the leadership, even though they're teabaggers, because it
   was just too embarassin' even for them)

   and, finally, the [3641]the "Our Chirrens Don't Need no Edumacashun or
   Protection" Act, which exempts charter schools from department of
   education oversight, and eliminates the requirement that teachers in
   charter schools be certified, have college degrees, or even pass
   criminal background checks. I am not making this up.

   And there are plenty more. The idiocy and corruption know no bounds.

   I don't know what else I can say about my state. Stick a fork in it,
   maybe?

       this:  the "Our Chirrens Don't Need no Edumacashun or Protection"

       I was reading up in the Melissa Harris Perry (sp?) vs. Rush&Beck

       and they are just the tip of the iceberg.
       There are many, many more:
       Disenfranchising poor and minority voters with a draconian Voter ID
       requirement
       Meddling in local city and town affairs in many more ways than just
       the bills I cited, including rescinding municipal authority to pass
       local taxes that municipal officials and their constituents see fit
       Overhauling the state's tax system to cut income taxes only at the
       very top, and cut corporate income taxes across the board, and
       replace these revenues with more sales taxes on everything so that
       working families can pay for the Repukes' fat-cat corporate donors'
       yachts and caviar
       Opening up the gun floodgates in every way possible
       Making records of gun permit holders private instead of their being
       public records as they are now...hey, what's the big secret? I
       thought these gun-nut vigilantes were proud of their patriotic
       gun-nuttism!
       Stripping virtually all environmental protections, including
       faster-tracking fracking with no further study
       De-funding the environmental regulations that they don't outright
       eliminate
       Repealing the Racial Justice Act, which has slowed executions while
       courts investigate bias in sentencing
       And on and on and on...

   We have an [3698]amendment in our state constitution that LIMITS
   freedoms,

   [3699]Senate bill 667 will force students to travel home or vote
   absentee or their parents will pay higher taxes.

   [3700]Bill 518, the "Healthy Marriage Act" bill, would impose a
   two-year waiting period to file for divorce. The bill also would
   require both people to take courses on improving communication skills
   and conflict resolution and, if they have a child, each also must
   complete a four-hour course on the impact of divorce on children.

   And, of course, the proposed [3701]voter ID billwould require voters to
   show photo identification, because - see my sig line, I mean - there's
   just so much PROVEN voter fraud.

   Went for a long ride on the bike for the job on Monday morning, came to
   the tollbooth, pulled my cash out of my pocket and paid my $3.  When I
   stopped at a store later, I found that I was missing a $20 bill I'd had
   earlier; and sadly assumed I'd dropped it at the tollbooth.  Got home
   later and found it on the kitchen floor.  Yay.  Had a load of topsoil
   delivered later, and the driver went through a lot of trouble to put
   the load where I wanted it, so I tipped the guy $20.  I figure I broke
   even.

   Cheers to warm weather.

       but the last few times I've tried it with the bike; the magic eye
       hasn't read it; and I got that nice friendly "buzzer of shame".
       When I know I'll be paying a toll, I keep cash in the pocket of the
       chaps, but yeah, the glove thing is a bit cumbersome.

   yesterday and to have followed the instructions exactly, only to find a
   fatal flaw - the battery door will not open!  The makes the camera an
   expensive paperweight!  I have contacted the seller.  It was a great
   disappointment as I am leaving for the Pacific Northwest on the 21st
   and wanted to have it for the trip, my trusty Panasonic 18X having just
   died. Well I still have the Nikon DSLR - a bit heavy and have to change
   lenses, but serviceable.

   Cheers to blooming Mexican buckeye, which was drawing bees even thought
   it is still a small plant.

   Jeers to two days of dust storm. It kicked up just a few hours before
   one of our daughters was to fly to LA.  She called us later and said
   that she had made it, but the ride was a bit bumpy.

   Cheers to living in a "backward state that never gets around to the
   most objectionable legislation that they pass in many states.  Despite
   having a large Catholic population abortion is still legal, birth
   control is reasonably available, and we mostly teach evolution in the
   schools (except in some of the real backward communities.)  We also, as
   was recently discovered, forgot to define marriage as between one man
   and one woman. They are hashing that out in Santa Fe now, with the
   mayor saying that gay marriage has always been legal and the
   Republicans begging to disagree.  Carpe Maana is our byword!  And
   maybe that is not such a bad thing - at least we don't rush in!  Viva

       Geez, that new one isn't much good if you can't get to the battery.
       I upgraded to a Canon Rebel a few weeks ago. My little

   I was tempted to vote "stomach" as the most worrisome pain. Cause
   usually my stomach aches are associated with a Crohn's flair. But at
   least I know what that is. I think a tooth ache is the most upsetting
   though. You never know what you are getting in to with that.

       I'm having a similar problem with my left shoulder.  Fortunately
       I'm seeing the chiropractor in a couple of hours.

 I've actually never been to a chiropractor ([4161]5+ / 0-)

       I AM planning a massage for next week though.
       The problem I'm having is either:
       1) overly aggressive workout on Monday or
       2) too much biking
       I'd rather go with the former.

 He's been adjusting my shoulder ... ([4171]5+ / 0-)

       ... in addition to the regular spine work.  He's sort of jamming
       (for lack of a better word) the ball back into the socket.  Never
       had this kind of adjustment before, but it seems to be helping.
       No idea how it came to be like this, so it's hard to know how to
       prevent it in the future.  In the meantime I'm just trying to be
       more intentional about stretching.
       I hope you feel better.  :-)
