[23]United States of Surveillance

   The [31]NSA surveillance program that harvests everyone's data can be
   very useful in building a terrorist profile.  Thanks to data-mining,
   the authorities could be tipped off to an individual who makes
   telephone calls to a Muslim from Somalia.  This person also regularly
   makes and receives phone calls from a convicted felon in the United
   States and is in Facebook communication with a Pakistani known to be
   interested in aviation.  The subject also attended school with a close
   relative of a well-known Saudi arms dealer and has recently made
   purchases of fertilizer within the United States.  Clearly, the
   metadata indicates this person warrants further investigation.

   This person is [32]me.

   That's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to my suspicious
   metadata, I imagine.  I'll release more as the days progress, and I
   won't even make you go to Hong Kong and look for a guy with a
   [33]Rubik's Cube.  I have had run-ins with the [34]authorities and have
   even received official notice of being a "scofflaw."  (True, though
   sadly, I seem to have lost the written evidence of being deemed an
   official scofflaw.)

   This NSA surveillance story is [35]amazing, and is thankfully shining a
   bright light on [36]abuses and [37]overreach within the government.
   Kind of funny that my earlier [38]prediction turned out so completely
   wrong, thanks to Edward Snowden.  Clearly, Snuggly has enough material
   for a year's worth of cartoons.

   Let Snuggly the Security Bear and I know what you think, and be sure to
   comment and share the cartoon.

   [Snuggly the Security Bear]

   Hi America!  I'm back!  Just a few weeks after telling you that
   snooping on a hundred-or-so reporters was no problem, Snuggly the
   Security Bear is back to tell you that snooping on, umm . . .

   All of you! . . . isn't a problem either!  Mmheeheehee!

   Just take it from my bosses, you've got nothing to worry about!

   Unless you're a terrorist, a treasonous leaker, or, um, a fan of the
   Bill of Rights!  Mmheeheehee!

   See, even though we said that we only snoop on terror suspects and the
   people talking with them-- turns out, in order to do that, we have to
   snoop on . . . everyone!

   But don't worry-- like the President says-- this is overseen by the
   three branches of government . . .

   Never mind it's one branch that lied to the other and a third who okays
   what the first wants 99.97 percent of the time!

   Certain sacrifices must be made if we're to keep you snuggly and
   secure!

   And remember, we're just tracking and storing "metadata."  Which means
   your phone number, who you called, when you called, where you were
   standing when you called, how long you talked, what kind of phone you
   talked on, who you called again and who called you back!

   But don't worry, we're not listening to the actual call!  Mmmheeheehee!

   And if you happen to be using the Internet, we'll be there, too . . .
   ready to get your emails, videos, chats, search words, and photos-- all
   to keep you snuggly and secure!

   It's all perfectly legal!  Just ask the secret court who won't reveal
   things to Congress . . . or ask the Director of National Intelligence,
   who does his very best to testify in the most "un-lying" sort of way!

   . . . Or ask the President who warned of the "false choice between
   liberties we cherish and the security--" er-- whoops, wrong quote.

   He said, "you can't have 100% security and also 100% privacy."

   Or better yet . . . don't ask at all!

   And remember, we're watching you!

   ALL of you!!

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [68]Tagging tips - [69]Search For Tags - [70]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [71]Civil
   Rights, [72]Community, [73]Congress, [74]Culture, [75]Economy,
   [76]Education, [77]Elections, [78]Energy, [79]Environment, [80]Health
   Care, [81]International, [82]Labor, [83]Law, [84]Media, [85]Meta,
   [86]National Security, [87]Science, [88]Transportation, or [89]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([90]California, [91]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       I was corresponding with several people in the Soviet space program
       (including cosmonaut Alexei Leonov).
       A freelance writer back then, I was working on a magazine article
       on the history of the Soviet space program.
       I also got a visit from the FBI less than two weeks after I
       returned from a trip to Sandinista Nicaragua, in 1988.  When I got
       the (edited) report from that interview under a FOIA lawsuit, I
       noticed that the Feds had gone so far as to write down the bumper
       stickers on my car.

       George W. Bush was president.  We got a very scary visit from two
       FBI agents, pounding at our door, demanding an interview with my
       husband.
       The reason?  We only found that out the next day during the
       "interview."
       Hubby had given money to John Edwards (yes, blush), using his
       website donor page, at the same time that the page was accessed by
       a person who sent suspicious white powder (wrapped in that page) to
       Edwards' campaign office.
       Now I wouldn't mind that they used the evidence in search of a
       criminal.  It was a fishing expedition, true, but not a major one.
       But the way they did it--coming in, pounding on my door, not
       telling me why they wanted to see my husband.
       I spent a night I wished was sleepless because my dreams were all
       about being disappeared.  I did not trust my government at all.
       And this was just to "rule us out."
       Just because the government keeps a record of real property
       transfers, it doesn't mean that the government wants to confiscate
       your home.

 An "ethnic slur" was NOT intended! ([377]0+ / 0-)

   ... But TheGryphon's subject question made me check. I see that the
   phrase can refer to all sorts of stuff that came after I learned it.

   The phrase originally meant (in Elizabethan times, I read!) that the
   trick was discovered, that one was found out. In the gangster movies of
   my yout' (I'm an old guy. A grumpy old guy from the streets, yah
   know?), "Eddie, the jig is up," was the phrase cops used when they
   caught Eddie the Perp and had him cornered.

   It was that light by which I read the diarist's mock mea culpa. But
   since the phrase can mean other things, mea culpa!

   Since The Man is always watching and The Man never sleeps, it is
   puzzling that a diary like this expressing concern about The Man could
   get published without The Man taking action.

   Or maybe not...

   Are those footsteps outside the neighbor coming home with his
   groceries?  Or the steps of a Home Security tactical squad setting up a
   perimeter to keep an eye on you?

   You never know.  Lack of evidence is merely proof of how good The Man
   is at covering his tracks.

   The same United States of Surveillance that is Always Watching Us seems
   to have slipped up a few times.  Like on 9/11.  And the Iranian
   Revolution.  And the fall of the Soviet Union.   But evidence of lack
   of omniscience is surely just another of The Man's ploys to lull us
   into letting our guard down.   Those who deny this truth are lackeys
   and fellow travelers unworthy of the liberty of spending every waking
   moment worrying about what The Man will do next.

   Progressives should take hope however.  If our pay-frozen, sequestered
   and furloughed federal employees are so successful at maintaining a
   United States of Surveillance, clearly all other tasks should be
   childrens' play.

   We just have to convince The Man that its time to end poverty.  Or end
   hunger.  Or clean up the environment.  The Man will make it so.

 Who Does Snowden Work For? ([542]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [543]ProgressiveOldMan

   Look there are legitimate concerns about the abuse of surveillance, but
   as pointed out in this comment thread, sometimes the government does
   have to follow up on legitimate potential threats. If you get all
   snuggly with people who potentially have missiles or IEDs aimed at
   American citizens, you can expect even a free country to take notice.
   In the best circumstances, the NSA and FBI are servants of freedom that
   would be taken away by people who want us to be servants of fear.
   Obvious exceptions: cf. GW Bush, Dick Cheney, Richard Nixon, etc.

   But the real question in my mind is Snowden's motivations. Now he's
   getting all snuggly with China in public, which makes one wonder if he
   wasn't rather snuggly with them before leaking this data. It's a
   question especially valid in that the story broke just before the
   Chinese leaders came to the U.S. for high-level talks. Hard to imagine
   a better cover for China to keep the U.S. from pressuring them on their
   much more real human rights abuses through surveillance. Snowden's
   self-aggrandizing personality fits the profile of a long list of
   informants who have colluded with unsavory governments just for the
   sake of their own egos - usually with some good cash flowing in the
   background. The signal to noise ratio in this story still needs to be
   improved...

 Easy for you to say ([556]0+ / 0-)
       As someone who lost friends and colleagues on 9/11, that's a little
       too easy and pat an answer for me. Surveillance as implemented is a
       tool to keep extreme fringe elements from interrupting the normal
       flow of a free society. The main problem is that when people start
       shouting about the executive branch this-and-that they tend to lose
       sight of a global picture in which much more powerful executive
       branches in China, Russia and the like are more than willing to
       throw us under the bus for their aims. We've given up the Cold War
       on one level since others haven't, we need to make informed
       decisions as to how to respond to state-sponsored asymmetrical
       threats. Redefine the rules a bit to make people happy? Perhaps.
       But let's be real - there are some real baddies out there, not to
       mention the ones who get control of our own government from time to
       time.

 I work five blocks from the White House. ([560]4+ / 0-)

       If anybody is likely to be harmed by a new terrorist incident, that
       includes me.
       I am a native New Yorker who has spent several months working at
       the Pentagon.
       When I was stationed with the Air Force in Berlin in 1970-2, that
       was when the Baader-Meinhof group was laying bombs in American
       military bases in Berlin.  Their bombs killed at least one member
       of an American military family.  Once, when I was walking outside
       the perimeter of my base, I saw a bomb squad discover and defuse a
       bomb that had been put perhaps a hundred yards from my barracks.
       I prefer to take the risk of being harmed by a new terrorist attack
       to the harm that I know would be caused by surveillance state
       measures.  I think everyone who understands the U.S. Constitution
       should feel the same way.

 Fear is the enemy ([572]0+ / 0-)

   Fearing your government can be as corrosive as fearing your
   government's enemy. It's reasonable to expect that we should not have
   to fear our own government if we're exercising our rights as free
   citizens, but it's also reasonable to expect them to deal with
   governments and organizations like global corporations who don't give a
   whit about freedoms. If we go into isolationist mode, then we only
   increase the power of people like Putin. Hitler got as far as he did in
   part because our nation had a false idealism about how much better our
   own nation was and how good it was not to deal with those evil folks
   overseas. Well, eventually they come knocking at your door. I am
   against a war on terrorism, that is, perpetual funding of a
   military-industrial complex that creates conflicts for its own
   self-perpetuation, but reasonable tools to monitor bad guys is a good
   idea.

   We know who Snowden worked for.  And it doesn't more than about 30
   seconds to know why he's getting "snuggly" with China: no extradition.

   And I don't buy your "it's OK as long as we're OK with the guys doing
   it".  The fact that this stuff is legal means that it will be legal no
   matter who is in charge.

   The claim that the government can give immunity to private persons from

   There appears to be solid evidence that the claim is true.

 Two things at work here ([589]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [590]ProgressiveOldMan, [591]drklassen

   I've heard reacent polling indicating (depending on poll and how they
   ask the question, of course) that the public is split on whether they
   support NSA surveillance or think it's an unconstitutional invasion of
   privacy.

   I have heard the trope from friends that "I don't care if they know who
   I called. They're catching terrorists". I think that a lot of people
   are following that line because first, they don't experience any direct
   inconvenience or problem to themselves. Their lives go along as usual,
   no impact. Second, they fall for the idea that watching communications
   traffic, both telephonic and internet, can't help but detect
   terrorists, right? I mean, if they're listening to everything, they'll
   know when something is being planned and stop it. That just makes
   sense, right?

   The thing is, we don't have any evidence that they can catch anyone or
   stop a plot through these means. Certainly, we may not know that
   because they are keeping everything very close to the vest. But I have
   a little trouble believing that this particular culture would not be
   trumpeting a success to the rooftops, even if they tried to mask the
   means of success.

   We also don't have any kind of arguments, explanations, or even a high
   level overview that supports exactly how these programs are going to
   keep us safer. Certainly, they didn't prevent the Boston Marathon
   bombing, and they didn't help to catch the perpetrators.

   The only thing we actually know about these programs is that they shift
   many billions of public dollars to the pockets of private corporations
   for little or no demonstrable public benefit. And the thing about "We
   can't talk about it or let it be overseen because it's so secret and if
   anyone knows about it, it won't work" sound a lot like the idea of
   "security by obscurity" which is amateurish and always ultimately
   ineffectual.

   We really need to get some actual oversight and governance going on in
   this country. Unless it's already too late.

 too much pananoia over NSA ([594]0+ / 0-)

   I'm a liberal Democrat and frankly I think the NSA has legitimate
   reasons to check out suspicious activity. Since it requires a warrant
   from the FISA court to look into actual phone calls and e-mails I  see
   no problem. If the NSA is over reaching then there is a problem. If
   they do get a warrant and look into someone's data and the person is
   not arrested, or charged they certainly have not lost their civil
   rights. Even is someone is charged they will get a trial in a civilian
   court, and have access to an attorney, so once again no civil liberties
   are lost. If you are proved not guilty of any wrong doing you will go
   free.

   Frankly I doubt the FBI, NSA, and contractors have time to be looking
   through everyone's emails and phone calls. We certainly always need to
   be vigilant in a Democracy to protect our civil liberties, but I think
   this paranoia over government intrusions in our privacy has been over
   hyped up by those like Greenwald in hopes of benefiting from the hype
   to  get attention for their ongoing government conspiracy theories.

   I think NSA, military, and contractors need to monitor more closely
   those they hire for these jobs, and tighten up access to security
   files.

       but on the people who threaten society's power structure. On
       whoever exists at the political margins, whether it's Martin Luther
       King Jr. or some Occupy Boston protesters. It's not some Orwellian
       abstraction. It's America's history --- and America's recent

 Liberals for surveillance ([647]0+ / 0-)

   Someone whom I thought knew better had this to say about the objections
   to NSA seizure of phone metadata:

   "We now face a constant, low-level terrorist threat that needs to be
   monitored. A great many lives are potentially at stake ... and our
   national security is more important than any marginal -- indeed,
   mythical -- rights that we may have conceded in the Patriot Act
   legislation. In the end, the slippery-slope, all-or-nothing arguments
   advanced by extreme civil libertarians bear an uncomfortable
   resemblance to the slippery-slope, all-or-nothing arguments advanced by
   the National Rifle Association."

   So - if you object to data mining, your - just like a gun nut!

   I find it interesting that while he thinks that this is keeping him
   safer, he fails to note that the metadata mining started during the
   Bush administration and yet despite this, it did not stop the Boston
   Marathon bombing from happening.

   The Patriot Act has done more to kill liberty in this country than any
   terrorist act and it is liberals like this man who help make it
   possible.
