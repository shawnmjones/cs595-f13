Obama's "Organizing for Action" pushing Illinois House to legalize gay
marriage

   WASHINGTON-President Barack Obama's Organizing for Action-the outgrowth
   of his re-election campaign-is jumping in the fight to legalize gay
   marriage in Illinois, on Tuesday sending an e-mail to Obama's Illinois
   activists and supporters asking them to lobby Illinois House members to

   WASHINGTON-President Barack Obama's Organizing for Action-the outgrowth
   of his re-election campaign-is jumping in the fight to legalize gay
   marriage in Illinois, on Tuesday sending an e-mail to Obama's Illinois
   activists and supporters asking them to lobby Illinois House members to
   vote yes on the marriage bill, already passed by the Illinois Senate.

   Obama already has urged the Illinois General Assembly to legalize gay
   marriage. Gov. Pat Quinn wants to sign a bill making Illinois the tenth
   state with gay marriage.

   Last month, an Illinois House Committee advanced the bill to the full
   House floor, but so far the measure lacks the votes to pass the
   chamber,[79] Sun-Times Springfield Bureau Chief Dave McKinney reports.

   This is the first attempt by OFA to get involved in an Illinois issue.
   The OFA, to have offices in Chicago and Washington was created to
   support the Obama agenda-and local issues that activists might want to
   work on.

   Below, the text of the e-mail from Organizing for Action.....

   If you care about marriage equality, here's something really important
   you can do right now.

   As early as this week, the Illinois State House could vote on a bill --
   already passed by the state Senate -- that will give all couples the
   legal right to marry. If it passes, Governor Quinn says he'll sign it
   into law. That's huge for all of us in the OFA family who care about
   this issue.

   Right now, reports say the bill is short of the votes it needs to pass,
   so these calls matter.

   Take two minutes and look up your state representative right now --
   then give them a call to let them know that you want them to vote YES
   on the Religious Freedom and Marriage Fairness Act.

   It's really easy: Just use that website to look up your address, click
   "confirm your address," then scroll down to find your state
   representative's information.

   Like President Obama said last year, he believes that marriage equality
   is a question of fairness -- of treating others the way you want to be
   treated.

   Right now, his home state is just one step away from becoming the 10th
   state in the nation to approve same-sex marriage -- and making sure
   that gay and lesbian families in Illinois are treated equally in the
   eyes of the law.

   We've heard from OFA supporters here in Illinois that this issue
   matters to you, and that's why we're teaming up with Illinois Unites
   for Marriage -- a joint project of ACLU Illinois, Equality Illinois,
   and Lambda Legal -- to add our voices to this fight.

   This House vote is the final hurdle to making sure this historic
   legislation becomes the law of the land. Right now, a number of state
   representatives are still undecided, and we know this vote's going to
   be close.

   Take a few minutes to look up your state representative today and urge
   them to vote YES in allowing all loving couples to share in the freedom
   to marry:
