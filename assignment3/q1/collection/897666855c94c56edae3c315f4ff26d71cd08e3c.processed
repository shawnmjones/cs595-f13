   night owl
   Greg Kauffman has, for a long time, been focused on poverty issues, a
   subject that rarely arouses much concern in the stenographic media but
   matters a great deal to tens of millions of Americans directly affected
   by it. What follows is the introduction and first question of an
   [29]interview at The Nation with a long-time organizer whose activism
   is worth emulating and who ideas are worth spreading. You can read the
   other eight questions at the link. There is also an action you may wish
   to participate in [30]here:

       [T]o build a new anti-poverty movement will require the kind of
    organizing and actions that are as creative, visible and gripping as
                      the Occupy Wall Street movement.

                            Enter Stephen Lerner.

   Lerner is a labor and community organizer who has spent more than three
     decades organizing hundreds of thousands of janitors, farm workers,
    garment workers and other low-wage workers into unions. These efforts
   resulted in increased wages, first-time health benefits, paid sick days
      and other improvements on the job. The architect of the historic
   Justice for Janitors campaign, he is currently working with unions and
         community groups across the country to break Wall Street's
            anti-democratic grip on our politics and our economy.

   Lerner lays out a powerful case about the intersection between poverty
    and Wall Street accountability--and how a Wall Street accountability
    movement can transform an economy that offers so few pathways out of
           poverty, and so many ways to keep people impoverished.

                          Here is our conversation:

    Greg Kaufmann: Why is the Wall Street accountability movement now the
        focus of your work, and what is the potential you see there?

   Stephen Lerner: One of the challenges is that there are so many things
   wrong right now--that you can be involved in any of a thousand causes.
   The problem is if they are disconnected it doesn't add up to anything.
     So, people who are opposed to poverty have a dozen different things
    they'd like to move on the Hill, none of which are likely to pass at
                                 this time.

   Stephen Lerner

       So the focus on Wall Street is: How do you connect all of these
    different battles? And, in fact, are there core things in common that
                            drive them together?

   If you look at some of the biggest issues of the day--whether it's the
   loss of wealth in communities of color, the housing crisis, the student
     debt crisis, local and state governments cutting jobs and services
    because of debt--you can connect all of these issues to the original
   economic crisis of 2008, and the growing and continued dominance of the
                           Wall Street big banks.

    The majority of people in this country are either impacted by student
    debt, the ongoing housing crisis or the crisis of the public sector.
    And you can trace so much of it to Wall Street. This means instead of
   having twenty separate campaigns, you can have one campaign, that says
     how do we rebalance and reorganize the economy so that it benefits
                everybody--not just a teeny elite at the top.

   [31]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2012--Mitt, you
   dunce, you have to remember your lies:

    We all know that Romney is a major liar. We've seen it over and over
   during this campaign. The pile of his lies already has grown enormously
           and the general election campaign is barely under way.

      For someone with his assets, you would think he would have hired
    himself a better coach of effective lying. He can certainly afford it
     given the gobs of cash he's sucked up by destroying jobs and being
    rewarded for it. But apparently he's been a cheapskate on that front.
       Because he just isn't very good at it despite all the practice.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       It's all they had that they though had even a remote chance of
       gaining some traction. Everybody else thought it was bullshit, but
       they figured if they kept at it long enough, it would become
       something it wasn't. And yet they were at least partially
       successful in reinforcing the narrative amongst their base, for
       further propagation to other low-info voters.
       They didn't expect to get called on it, I guess.

   The Repugs knew that they could lie about and smear the Obama

   basically handed them (the media) a note that said "We're lying our

       Sounds like that's begun according to this [237]NYT article. They
       want to make it about health care, they want to blame the leaking
       of tax documents by whistleblowers. They'll spend the summer
       calling one sorry-assed Teabagger after another to talk about how
       the IRS harassed them by making sure they deserved tax exempt
       status. And is it just me or has not a single Republican named a
       single fking law that was actually broken?

   What is considered 'average' scandal interest?

   Watergate? Clinton-related?

   All they need to do is go on some Sunday Shows ask what it is that Issa
   doesn't want the public to hear about Benghazi (the truth).

   The only problem with this is that the Sunday Talk Show circuit is a
   right wing circle jerk. If they knew Pickering and Mullin were going to

   invite them on.

   I find myself believing that the question of whether the stories of
   this week are "scandals" is irrelevant.  Many take the position (right
   or wrong) that these events are not scandals.  This position meshes
   with the concept that, if it weren't for this (non-scandal) Republican
   theater, everyone would be back to the serious business of governing.

   But we wouldn't.  And we won't until at least after the 2014 elections.
    Any substantive new legislation in the current Congress requires at
   least some Republican support, and it's just not happening for
   anything.  It also doesn't appear to be likely for the foreseeable
   future.

   Those who have been advocating grass roots efforts and the bully pulpit
   to get things done have fallen short in their estimate of Republicans
   as malleable by public opinion.  If we can't enhance firearm background
   checks with 90% public support, bipartisan legislative support, and a
   full court press by the President, we can't do anything for the time
   being.  Maybe (just maybe) we can do something on immigration reform,
   but that seems to be about it.

   So, whether something is a scandal or not doesn't strike me as an
   important question, because even after the talk dies down the serious
   business of governing won't recommence.  At least these
   scandals/non-scandals are giving the folks in Washington something to
   do.

 much of todays activism is practically useless ([806]4+ / 0-)

   whatever the purpose of the activism, to have real effect it needs to
   end up as local or national legislation, or stopping or reversing or
   enforcing legislation, as part of the democratic process. that involves
   our representatives feeling that constituency and pressure.

   the 1%'s think tanks just have to watch and wait. the high paid workers
   in the 'think tanks' watch for those possible
   changes/improvements/progress/reforms/messaging and develop campaigns
   to counter/distort/distract/swiftboat  in response.

   they start their campaigns by sending the talking points out to 1200 or
   more RW radio stations to mobilize a well disinformed made-to-order
   constituency which is basically the GOP base- the talk radio base. they
   are small in number- essentially a small minority, but they are well
   timed and coordinated. they already live in the haze of a well
   cultivated alternate reality built on 25 years of national ubiquitous
   coordinated repetition to 50 mil a week. all they need is  little
   prodding spiked with hate and fear to stimulate some targeted outrage
   to intimidate and enable GOP and blue dog (talk radio state) dems along
   with some republican owned MSM.

   so, basically, how many democracy-loving hard working
   activists/protestors is one idiot reading chamber of
   commerce/ALEC/rove/koch bros talking points over a giant community
   public airwaves megaphone worth?

   until the left starts challenging the right's best weapon, a lot.

   learner and a lot of dedicated hard working principled americans are
   getting punked and they don't know it because talk radio is a 'dying'
   technology that's invisible to them.

   benghazi.

   Heritage Action to House Leaders: Keep Focus on Scandals - may 8th 2013
   - (I didn't want to give them any traffic but wanted to confirm the
   report)

     Rather than scheduling such legislation for consideration, we urge
     you to keep the attention focused squarely on the Obama
     administration.

   No work on job creating legislation. No immigration work. No work of
   any kind. Nothing but scandals

   Nothing but another vote on PPACA - at a running total of 55 million
   dollars so far.

   The republicans in congress are less than useless they're costing
   America jobs, time we don't have, and money that could be much better
   spent.

   ..and these republicans take their marching orders from a 1%er funded
   lobbying group not their constituents.

   This is a message that Dems should be shouting from the rooftops while
   pushing our agenda imo

   I'm hoping this will be a very good 6th year election cycle

 flipping eminent domain on it's head ([841]0+ / 0-)

     For years eminent domain was the tool to take advantage of poor
     people--tear up a neighborhood, build a highway, build a stadium and
     tell people they will be paid what their homes are worth on the open
     market. They said it was for the public good, even as it devastated
     once stable neighborhoods. We're saying let's flip that on it's
     head--for the public good, let's seize these mortgages and rewrite
     them at current market value so people can stay in their homes.

   Not sure how that works but if the homeowners keeps his/her home - good
   deal

   How about eminent domain on the profits from the financial
   "instruments" - mortaged backed securities sold as AAA but were junk
   that wall street actually made money betting against.
   Put some eminent domain non that mountian of loot

     A real scandal is the extent to which radical right-wing
     conservatives have managed to corrupt, to some extent, every single
     agency in the Executive Branch, for instance: restrictions placed on
     the Center for Disease Control by the National Rifle Association,
     the constant right-wing threats against the Environmental Protection
     Agency, and the latest threat of the GOP to render the National
     Labor Relations Board inoperative. There's also been the ideological
     corruption of the Judicial Branch.

     A real scandal is the magnitude of air and water pollution across
     the nation along with worsening threat of global warming, while
     government efforts to address these problems are obstructed by GOP
     corporatists.

     A real scandal is the conservatives' use of one "study," the
     Reinhart/Rogoff report to push for an austerity budget when the
     "study" has now been exposed as fraudulent - and the austerity
     theory itself revealed to be fraudulent - while the rich get richer
     and millions of Americans face long-term unemployment.

     A real scandal is the extent of poverty in the United States with
     almost half of Americans dying close to penniless, in a nation in
     which the top one-hundredth of one percent average some $27 million
     per household while the average income for the bottom 90 percent is
     a little over $31,000.

     A real scandal is how consistently the United States lags in
     international measurements for education (17th in the developed
     world) and for health care (37th out of 191 countries).
     Increasingly, ignorance shapes the national discourse with many
     Americans who rate the Benghazi case a major scandal not even
     knowing where it is.

     A real scandal is the deliberate misinterpretation of the Second
     Amendment by the Right for political purposes and to serve the
     firearms industry, a distortion compounded the failure of the Left
     and centrist politicians to challenge the falsehoods. General
     citizens and corporate journalists apparently don't read history and
     the Constitution - or are unfamiliar with the English language.

     A real scandal is the continued takeover of the United States
     political and economic system by the military-industrial complex and
     by corporations, a power grab facilitated by five right-wing
     justices on the U.S. Supreme Court and their 2010 decision in
     Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. That decision also
     laid the groundwork for the current IRS "scandal" because so many
     right-wing groups rushed to exploit the 501-c-4 tax-exempt "social
     welfare" category to carry out their political agendas.

     "One man's junk is another man's treasure," he said. One of the
     world's largest dealers of petroleum coke is the Oxbow Corporation,
     which sells about 11 million tons of fuel-grade coke a year. It is
     owned by William I. Koch, a brother of David and Charles.

   That's from a story,
   A Black Mound of Canadian Oil Waste Is Rising Over Detroit
   in today's New York Times  [872]http://www.nytimes.com/...
   David and Charles Koch, the Koch Brothers we've heard of, own that pile
   of Canadian Oil Waste.  You can't get a permit to burn the stuff in the
   United States, because it has a lot of sulfur in it, but it gets sent
   to Mexico and China and they burn it.  That means the carbon dioxide
   and sulfur oxides from burning it take a few months to drift back here.
    Those sulfur oxides cause acid rain, and the carbon dioxide
   contributes to global warming.

   Two tiny bits of possible good news in that: some of the acid rain may
   fall into the Pacific before it gets to any land, and while the sulfur
   oxides are still in the air they seem to favor dense cloud formation,
   that can reduce global warming because the clouds reflect more sunlight
   back into space.

   We're all pretty strange one way or another; some of us just hide it
   better. "Normal" is a dryer setting.
