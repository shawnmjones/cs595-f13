   Throughout my careers in software and philanthropy--and in each of my
   annual letters--a recurring theme has been that innovation is the key
   to improving the world. When innovators work on urgent problems and
   deliver solutions to people in need, the results can be magical.

   Right now, just over 1 billion people--about 15 percent of the people
   in the world--live in extreme poverty. On most days, they worry about
   whether their family will have enough food to eat. There is irony in
   this, since most of them live and work on farms. The problem is that
   their farms, which tend to be just a couple acres in size, don't
   produce enough food for a family to live on.

   Fifteen percent of the world in extreme poverty actually represents a
   big improvement. Fifty years ago, about 40 percent of the global
   population was poor. Then, in the 1960s and 1970s, in what is called
   the "Green Revolution," Norman Borlaug and other researchers created
   new seed varieties for rice, wheat, and maize (corn) that helped many
   farmers vastly improve their yields. In some places, like East Asia,
   food intake went up by as much as 50 percent. Globally, the price of
   wheat dropped by two-thirds. These changes saved countless lives and
   helped nations develop.

   We have the ability to accelerate this historic progress. We can be
   more innovative about delivering solutions that already exist to the
   farmers who need them. Knowledge about managing soil and tools like
   drip irrigation can help poor farmers grow more food today. We can also
   discover new approaches and create new tools to fundamentally transform
   farmers' lives. But we won't advance if we don't continue to fund
   agricultural innovation, and I am very worried about where those funds
   will come from in the current economic and political climate.

    The world faces a clear choice. If we invest relatively modest
   amounts, many more poor farmers will be able to feed their families. If
   we don't, one in seven people will continue living needlessly on the
   edge of starvation. My annual letter this year is an argument for
   making the choice to keep on helping extremely poor people build
   self-sufficiency.

   My concern is not only about farming; it applies to all the areas of
   global development and global health in which we work. Using the latest
   tools--seeds, vaccines, AIDS drugs, and contraceptives, for example--we
   have made impressive progress. However, if we don't make these success
   stories widely known, we won't generate the funding commitments needed
   to maintain progress and save lives. At stake are the future prospects
   of one billion human beings.

Innovation in Agriculture

   The private market does a great job of innovating in many areas,
   particularly for people who have money. The focus of Melinda‚s and my
   foundation is to encourage innovation in the areas where there is less
   profit opportunity but where the impact for those in need is very high.
   That is why we have devoted almost $2 billion to helping poor farm
   families, most of which are led by women, boost their productivity
   while preserving the land for future generations. Those funds are
   invested in many areas of innovation, ranging from sustainable land
   management, to better ways to educate farmers, to connecting farmers to
   functioning markets.

   We do all these things with one goal in mind‚helping people like
   Christina Mwinjipe, a farmer I met last year in Tanzania. Christina
   supports her family by farming cassava, a staple crop that provides a
   basic diet for more than 500 million people worldwide. (When dried to a
   powder, cassava is known as tapioca.) In the past two years,
   Christina‚s crop has been invaded by two cassava diseases. The leaves
   of some of her plants are curled and withered, and covered in the white
   flies that carry mosaic disease. The roots of other plants are rotted
   by brown streak disease. Because of these diseases, she is depleting
   her savings to buy cassava to feed her three children Her oldest son
   just passed his examinations to enter secondary school, but she doesn‚t
   know where she‚ll find the money to pay his fees. She is not sure what
   she will do about food when her savings run out.

   For Christina and other small farmers‚and for hundreds of millions of
   extremely poor people living in slums in big cities‚getting food is the
   most pressing daily concern. And food is strongly connected to another
   constant worry: basic health. The lack of adequate nutrition is a key
   reason why poor children so often die of diseases like diarrhea that
   richer and better-fed children are able to fight off. Poor nutrition in
   childhood also prevents the development of both the brain and the body,
   severely and irreversibly limiting children‚s ability to grow, learn,
   and become healthy, productive adults. Ultimately, there is very little
   in Christina‚s life‚or her children‚s lives‚that doesn‚t depend on her
   cassava crop.

   Farming is a great example of something critical to the poor that gets
   very little attention in rich countries. Back in the 19th century, the
   majority of people in the United States worked in agriculture. Now less
   than 2 percent of the workforce is involved in farming, and less than
   15 percent of U.S. consumer spending goes to food. Farming issues
   rarely make the news. The exceptions are when food is contaminated,
   when government subsidies are being debated, or when there is a famine
   like the current one in the Horn of Africa.

   Despite the rich world‚s distance from farming, food-related issues are
   important for all of us. In the 1960s and 1970s, when I was in high
   school, people worried that we simply couldn‚t grow enough food to feed
   everyone in the world. A popular book that came out in 1968, The
   Population Bomb by Paul Ehrlich, began with the statement: ‚The battle
   to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of
   people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked
   upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase
   in the world death rate‚¶‚ Fortunately, due in large part to the Green
   Revolution, this dire prediction was wrong.

   But the world‚s success in warding off famine led to complacency. Over
   time, governments in both developed and developing countries focused
   less on agriculture. Agricultural aid fell from 17 percent of all aid
   from rich countries in 1987 to just 4 percent in 2006. In the past 10
   years, the demand for food has gone up because of population growth and
   economic development‚as people get richer, they tend to eat more meat,
   which indirectly raises demand for grain. Supply growth has not kept
   up, leading to higher prices. Meanwhile, the threat of climate change
   is becoming clearer. Preliminary studies show that the rise in global
   temperature alone could reduce the productivity of the main crops by
   over 25 percent. Climate change will also increase the number of
   droughts and floods that can wipe out an entire season of crops. More
   and more people are raising familiar alarms about whether the world
   will be able to support itself in the future, as the population heads
   toward a projected 9.7 billion by 2050.

   I believe these new dire predictions can be wrong, too. We can help
   poor farmers sustainably increase their productivity so they can feed
   themselves and their families. By doing so, they will contribute to
   global food security. But that will happen only if we prioritize
   agricultural innovation.

Agricultural Research

   [85]Share
   [86]Share [spacer1x1.gif] [spacer1x1.gif] [spacer1x1.gif]
   [87]up Section [88]down

   Given the central role that food plays in human welfare and national
   stability, it is shocking‚not to mention short-sighted and potentially
   dangerous‚how little money is spent on agricultural research. In total,
   only $3 billion per year is spent on researching the seven most
   important crops. This includes $1.5 billion spent by countries, $1.2
   billion by private companies, and $300 million by an agency called the
   Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Even
   though the CGIAR money is only 10 percent of the spending, it is
   critical because it focuses on the needs of poor countries. Very little
   of the country and private spending goes toward the priorities of small
   farmers in Africa or South Asia.

   This shortage of funds for research is particularly worrying because of
   the increasing prevalence of plant diseases, such as those destroying
   Christina Mwinjipe‚s cassava plants. Just like humans, plants get
   attacked by viruses, bacteria, and fungi. They also have to defend
   themselves against insects or animals, but unlike humans they can‚t run
   away from their predators. Plants have developed sophisticated systems
   for defending themselves that we are just starting to understand. One
   amazing discovery is that in some species when one plant is attacked it
   gives off a scent that tells other plants to focus their energy on
   defending themselves rather than on growing.

   Because farmers plant seeds that give them the highest yields, the
   diversity of crop varieties in fields is quite limited. This creates a
   perfect opportunity for disease to spread. A famous example of this is
   the potato blight that spread across Europe in the 1840s and led to
   mass starvation in Ireland. Less well known is the southern corn leaf
   blight that swept through the United States in the early 1970s.
   Fortunately, in that case, the United States had sufficient strategic
   reserves to avert a crisis.

   Norman Borlaug, Nobel Prize winner and father of the Green Revolution,
   first got involved in plant science after he heard a professor give a
   speech entitled ‚These Shifty Little Enemies That Destroy Our Food
   Crops.‚ The Rockefeller Foundation enticed Borlaug to move to Mexico,
   where he created new varieties of wheat that were resistant to a fungus
   called wheat stem rust. It was only after he got there that he figured
   out additional strategies to increase wheat productivity. Borlaug was
   always concerned that new forms of wheat rust would emerge.
   Unfortunately, he was proven right in 1999 when a new and extremely
   virulent wheat rust called Ug99 was found in Uganda. Though Ug99 is
   still mostly in Africa, it has jumped the Red Sea and is now being
   found in Iran and Yemen, on its way toward India.

   The response to Ug99 started slowly, but great work by a collection of
   experts, including researchers in Ethiopia and Kenya, has led to new
   varieties with some level of resistance. A huge effort is being
   undertaken to make sure that the new resistant varieties are adopted
   broadly before the disease moves into Asia or the Americas.

   Another area where scientists need to do a lot more study is the
   effects of climate change on agricultural productivity. It looks like
   there may be varieties of rice and other crops that can deal with the
   higher temperatures and weather variations better than today‚s plants.
   Some plant varieties actually benefit from the increased CO2 levels,
   although there is no clear data on how significant this will be. Early
   greenhouse studies were very promising, but field studies have shown
   much smaller effects. The world must invest in a variety of techniques
   to help poor farmers deal with weather impacts better than they can
   today.

   For example, when I was in India in March I met with about 20 rice
   farmers who had recently switched to a new rice seed called
   Swarna-Sub1, which is both very productive and can survive in flooded
   fields. Their rice fields get flooded every three to four years, and in
   past flood years they ended up with almost no food to eat. Now, these
   farmers can feed their families no matter the weather. Currently, 4
   million tons of rice are lost to flooding every year in Bangladesh and
   India. But as farmers in the region adopt Swarna-Sub1, they will grow
   enough extra rice to feed 30 million people.

   Fortunately, there are reasons to believe that the chronic underfunding
   of research in agriculture is starting to change‚and that there will be
   more breakthroughs like Swarna-Sub1. One approach that looks promising
   is innovative partnerships with private companies where the companies
   donate proprietary assets in which they have invested hundreds of
   millions of dollars, as well as their expertise, to help make
   appropriate varieties available royalty-free to poor farmers. Other key
   partners are rapidly growing countries like Brazil and China, which
   bring not only new resources but also deep experience in helping poor
   farmers at home. Brazil is a leader in soybeans, cassava, and tropical
   soils. China is a leader in rice and farmer education. This year the
   foundation entered into model agreements to work with both countries.

   There is also an extremely important revolution‚based on understanding
   plant genes‚taking place in the plant sciences. The tools that enable
   this revolution were created to help cure human diseases. The field of
   agriculture is just now in the process of figuring out how to take
   advantage of these tools, but it‚s clear that they will greatly
   accelerate the pace of plant research. It is hard to overstate how
   valuable it is to have all the incredible tools that are used for human
   disease to study plants.

   Historically, increasing the productivity of a crop meant finding two
   seed variants, each with some desirable and undesirable
   characteristics, and crossing them until you get a combination with
   mostly the good characteristics of the two parents. This required
   actually growing tens of thousands of plants to see how they develop in
   different growing conditions over time‚for example, when water is
   plentiful and when it is not.

   Now the process is quite different. Imagine the analogy of a large
   public library with rooms full of books. We used to have to use the
   card catalogue and browse through the books to find the information we
   needed. Now we know the precise page that contains the piece of
   information we need. In the same way, we can find out precisely which
   plant contains what gene conferring a specific characteristic. This
   will make plant breeding happen at a much faster clip. The private
   sector has moved the fastest to use new approaches, but academic
   groups, including a Chinese group called BGI that has more sequencing
   capability than any other group in the world, are catching up.

   When I was in Tanzania meeting Christina Mwinjipe, I also met Dr.
   Joseph Ndunguru, a plant scientist leading a project to fight the
   mosaic and brown streak diseases that are attacking Christina‚s cassava
   crop. Dr. Ndunguru is part of a new generation of African scientists
   building up the capacity to do innovative science in Africa. Dr.
   Ndunguru was offered a high-paying job in South Africa, but he chose to
   keep working for the Tanzanian national program. I asked him why, and
   he replied that the work he was doing with the national program was the
   best way he could connect state-of-the-art science with the needs of
   the local farmers.

   When I talk about innovation, it can be abstract for some people. But
   the direct link between the challenges Christina faces when her crop is
   destroyed and the solutions that Dr. Ndunguru is working on every day
   makes it very concrete. Disease-resistant cassava is an answer to
   Christina‚s prayers, and I look forward to the day when Dr. Ndunguru‚s
   work is done and I can go back to Tanzania and see Christina‚s field
   thick with healthy cassava plants. That is why I say that innovation
   has been and will continue to be the key to improving the world.

Global Health

   [91]up Section [92]down

   Most of the foundation‚s resources go to global health issues, and our
   guiding principles for those investments are the same as for
   agriculture: Innovation is the means, and equity is the end goal. When
   Melinda and I started this work more than a decade ago, we were
   inspired by the conviction that ‚all lives have equal value.‚ So one of
   the first things we invested in was vaccines, which protect all
   children who receive them, no matter how rich or poor they may be. In
   short, vaccines work. Two years ago, Melinda and I called on the global
   health community to make this decade the ‚Decade of Vaccines.‚

   The organization responsible for helping poor countries introduce new
   lifesaving vaccines is called the GAVI Alliance. Last summer, GAVI
   hosted a meeting to get pledges from donor countries and organizations.
   The goal was to raise at least $3.7 billion over five years, and we
   knew it wasn‚t the ideal time to be asking for that kind of money.
   Throughout the spring, we really didn‚t know if we were going to make
   it. Finally, a few weeks before the conference began, the pledges
   started trickling in‚and they were consistently at the top of the range
   we‚d expected. On the last day, we were tallying up the numbers as they
   came in to see what the total would be. GAVI ended up receiving $4.3
   billion in pledges.

   Because of that money, the poorest infants in the world will start
   receiving the same vaccines that infants in rich countries receive. Due
   to donors‚ generosity and to significant price reductions from vaccine
   manufacturers, GAVI is now supporting two relatively new vaccines,
   rotavirus (to prevent the leading cause of diarrhea) and pneumococcus.
   By 2015, these vaccines will prevent 190,000 diarrheal deaths and
   480,000 respiratory deaths‚not to mention improving the overall health
   of hundreds of millions of children. The money that has been pledged to
   GAVI will save 4 million lives by 2015.

   That‚s why I think of June 13, 2011, the date of the pledging
   conference, as a historic day for global health equity. It was an
   emotional moment for Melinda and me. We were happy that our foundation
   played a role in helping the world reach that milestone. But what
   really moved us was the fact that so many partners share our vision of
   an equitable world and are willing to put money behind it, even in
   these tough times. When people know the kind of impact their generosity
   has, they are not only willing but eager to help.

   There were other huge milestones in global health last year. There were
   also a few setbacks. In this section of my letter, I will talk about
   those milestones and setbacks, the challenges that lie ahead, and the
   solutions that excite me most.

Vaccines

   [95]up Section [96]down

   There are still years of work to be done to introduce the diarrhea and
   pneumonia vaccines into every country. Moreover, global coverage of
   basic childhood vaccines is around 80 percent, which is good compared
   to many other health interventions but leaves one out of five children
   unprotected. We need to recreate the high-level political focus that
   this issue received during the 1970s, when dedicated effort brought us
   from just 20 percent coverage to 80 percent coverage in most countries
   in just a decade.

   When I spoke at the World Health Assembly last May, I announced that I
   was creating the Gates Vaccine Innovation Award. We were pleased to
   receive 117 nominations encompassing a lot of amazing work. Vaccines
   are the only high-technology product that needs to be delivered to
   every single child. To miss zero children, it takes an incredible
   amount of ingenuity, and that‚s why we created the award.

   I am pleased to announce here that the first award will recognize the
   work of Dr. Asm Amjad Hossain, a district immunization medical officer
   from Bangladesh. In 2009, Dr. Hossain was assigned to two districts
   where immunization rates were 67 and 60 percent, respectively. In 2010,
   they were 85 and 79 percent. These rapid improvements were the result
   of Dr. Hossain‚s innovative approach to running an immunization
   program. He instituted a process of registering pregnant women with
   their expected date of delivery, location, and phone number, so
   vaccinators knew when children were born, where they were, and an easy
   way to contact their mothers. He provided annual schedules for vaccine
   sessions to make vaccinators more accountable to the community and had
   the vaccinators put their phone numbers on the children‚s immunization
   cards, so parents with young children could get in touch with a health
   worker. These may seem like small innovations, but they show how
   looking at old problems in new ways can make a profound difference.
   Improvements like these are spreading to other locations because of the
   commitment and creativity of Dr. Hossain and many others like him.
   Delivering lifesaving vaccines takes the dedication of many well-known
   players like GAVI, the World Health Organization, and UNICEF;
   government officials; and perhaps most importantly hundreds of
   thousands of heroes on the frontline like Dr. Hossain.

Polio

   The foundation's top priority remains helping to complete the
   eradication of polio, perhaps the best-known vaccine-preventable
   disease in the world. I spend a lot of my time learning about the
   disease and being an advocate for doing what it takes to end polio. At
   the start of 2011, poliovirus was still spreading in three areas: 10
   countries in Africa (with viruses that originated primarily in
   Nigeria), Afghanistan and Pakistan, and India.

   Now India has reached a huge milestone. The country had only one case
   in 2011, which was recorded on January 13 in West Bengal. So on January
   13, 2012, India celebrated its first year of being polio free. The
   challenge in India was mind-boggling. It's hard to imagine how you
   would design a polio campaign that reached every Indian child. More
   than a billion people live in the country. Massive numbers of families
   migrate constantly to find work. One of the largest states, Bihar, is
   flood-prone. In some cases, the vaccine didn't work as well as it had
   in other parts of the world, probably because of malnourishment,
   diarrhea, and other illnesses. But the government kept raising
   awareness and improving the quality of its campaigns, even in the
   toughest locations. The Indian government deserves special credit for
   this achievement.

   In 2012 we need to keep India and all the other places that are polio
   free from getting re-infected. The biggest focus for 2012 will be
   improving the polio vaccination campaigns in Nigeria, Chad, the
   Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. I recently
   visited Chad and Nigeria to meet with leaders there, and it's clear
   that we have high-level political support. Still, deploying
   high-quality vaccination teams and educating parents so that every
   single child is vaccinated will take a lot of work. In Nigeria our
   biggest problems are low-quality campaigns and the fact that some
   parents don't trust that the vaccine is safe. In Pakistan these
   problems are compounded by the security situation.

   It will be challenging to continue raising the approximately $1 billion
   per year it takes to run the global campaign. Last year the United
   States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Canada, Norway, Saudi
   Arabia, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and Rotary International
   provided substantial contributions. Rotary continues to be the heart
   and soul of polio eradication, supporting the program directly while
   also taking on a larger role in encouraging other donors to give more.
   A new partner, FC Barcelona, is spreading the message of polio
   eradication to millions of football fans across the globe.

   We are continuing to invest in studies about how polio spreads and
   trying to model where we need to intensify the vaccination campaigns.
   We are also working on new vaccines. Finding every last poliovirus
   requires good tools along with trained and motivated workers in every
   single country.

   These are enormous obstacles, but the success of the polio eradication
   program in India and 90 other countries gives me confidence that we can
   triumph in these final challenging countries and end polio once and for
   all.

   The AIDS community has three big goals:
    1. Reduce the number of people getting infected. By 2015, the goal is
       to cut infections to 1 million per year, which would represent a 68
       percent drop from the peak a decade ago.
    2. Provide drugs for everyone who needs them, so those with AIDS can
       live longer and more productive lives. Last year, 1.8 million
       people died of AIDS.
    3. Find a cure. Although there are people working toward a cure, it is
       viewed as so difficult that we can‚t count on ever having one.

   There are many ways to tackle the first goal: reducing infection. These
   methods can work individually and in combination. One approach is to
   convince people to avoid risky behavior. Education efforts are
   important, and they are getting more targeted, but their impact is
   uncertain.

   A second approach is male circumcision, which reduces HIV transmission
   by up to 70 percent. Funding for circumcision is finally being
   prioritized, since the cost is quite low and the protection is
   lifelong. Over 1 million men ages 15‚49 have been circumcised in 14
   Southern and Eastern African countries with large AIDS epidemics, but
   that is only 5 percent of the total number who could benefit from the
   procedure. Even in the ancient practice of circumcision, innovation has
   the potential to make a big difference. The new PrePex and Shang Ring
   devices simplify the procedure and make surgery unnecessary. The first
   studies suggest that these devices are both safe and effective. (I will
   keep this letter G-rated by leaving out the pictures of how the devices
   work.) Botswana, Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania are starting to show
   leadership by getting the message out to all young men that it is
   important to get circumcised. Kenya has made the most progress,
   circumcising 70 percent of eligible men. I will be very disappointed
   if, by 2015, any fewer than 15 million young men have chosen to protect
   themselves and their partners by getting circumcised.

   A third approach to prevention is to come up with an injection or pill
   or gel that reduces an uninfected person‚s chance of becoming infected.
   The final results of studies of a number of these tools were reported
   in the last 18 months. In studies where the patients used the tool as
   they were supposed to, the results were quite good. However, in most
   studies the levels of usage were low and thus the overall results were
   disappointing. This has the field thinking hard about how you could
   motivate better adherence or create a tool that requires less effort
   from the patient. One example in early development is an injection that
   lasts 30 to 90 days. I think we will solve the adherence problem, but
   we are going to have to get medical scientists, social scientists,
   community representatives, and regulators working together. We have to
   develop and test overall delivery systems, including communication,
   support, and incentives, in ways that go beyond what a medical trial
   alone typically does.

   A fourth approach, called treatment for prevention, is to give
   antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to people with AIDS earlier in the course of
   their disease, greatly reducing the chance that they will infect
   others. This is already done for pregnant mothers to reduce the chance
   of infecting their babies during delivery or through breast-feeding.
   The field has a goal of getting drugs to 90 percent of HIV-positive
   mothers by 2015, virtually ending mother-to-child transmission. The
   main problem with treatment for prevention is that most people who are
   infected with and transmitting HIV don‚t know they are infected, so you
   wouldn‚t know to give them drugs. In order to realize the full
   potential of treatment for prevention, we need to encourage widespread
   HIV testing, which will require developing a reliable, inexpensive
   saliva test that can be used privately.

   One further approach to prevention is an AIDS vaccine. On this topic,
   this year‚s news is very similar to last year‚s. The scientific
   understanding of the AIDS virus‚its shape, how it enters cells, and how
   we can use antibodies to block it‚has advanced more than expected.
   However, plans for conducting trials of different constructs are still
   not as aggressive as they should be, given how game-changing a vaccine
   would be. It is still possible to have a vaccine within 12 years, but
   it will take some luck and better planning.

   It is exciting to have so many prevention approaches available, and to
   be making progress on most of them. Funding continues to be a serious
   concern, but I am optimistic that the field will develop combined
   approaches to significantly bring down the rate of infection.

   Meanwhile, there has also been amazing progress on the second major
   goal for the AIDS community: scaling up treatment. This is due mostly
   to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and to a
   U.S. program called PEPFAR: the United States President‚s Emergency
   Plan for AIDS Relief. More than 6.6 million people are alive today
   because they are taking ARV drugs. Ten years ago it looked as if almost
   all of these people would die because the drugs were available only in
   rich countries.

   Between 2008 and 2010 the Global Fund gave $8 billion for AIDS (57
   percent), malaria (29 percent), and tuberculosis (14 percent). Other
   than PEPFAR for AIDS, the Global Fund is the biggest donor for all
   three of these diseases. It provided the money for 230 million bednets,
   which have been key to the 20 percent decline in malaria deaths over
   the past decade. It also provided treatment for 8.6 million cases of
   tuberculosis. I am not doing a section on malaria or TB in this year‚s
   letter, but there has been good progress in both diseases, with the
   Global Fund being key to this.

   The Global Fund does a lot to make sure its money is spent efficiently.
   Given the places where the Global Fund works, it is not surprising that
   some of the money was diverted for corrupt purposes. However, the
   Global Fund found these problems itself and changed the way it handled
   training grants, where most of the problems were. Unfortunately, news
   of any corruption makes many citizens think the entire program is
   mismanaged and a huge portion of the money is being wasted. Some of the
   headlines that talked about two-thirds of specific grants being
   misdirected fueled this impression. In fact, less than 5 percent of
   Global Fund money was misused, and with the new procedures in place
   that percentage will be even lower. Our foundation is the biggest
   nongovernment supporter of the Global Fund, committing $650 million
   over the years because of the incredible impact its spending has. I am
   confident that this is one of the most effective ways we invest our
   money every year, and I always urge other funders to join us in getting
   so much bang for our buck.

   Between 2011 and 2013, assuming that all donors honor their
   commitments, the Global Fund will disburse $10 billion. This is a $2
   billion increase, but not nearly the $12‚$14 billion that is needed and
   was hoped for. Citizens of donor countries should know about the
   difference their generosity has made. The cost of keeping a patient on
   AIDS drugs has been coming down, and it looks like getting it to $300
   per patient per year should be achievable. That will mean every $300
   that governments invest in the Global Fund will put another person on
   treatment for a year. Every $300 that‚s not forthcoming will represent
   a person taken off treatment. That‚s a very clear choice. I believe
   that if people understood the choice, they would ask their government
   to save more lives.

Family Planning

   Melinda has focused a lot of her foundation time on family health
   issues, including maternal and infant health, nutrition, and family
   planning. In 2012 and beyond, she will really emphasize family
   planning--giving women the tools they need to plan how many children
   they have and when they have them. She will be talking much more about
   how having the ability to plan changes the lives of women and their
   families and improves whole societies. Last year, Melinda met with
   mothers in Korogocho, a slum outside of Nairobi, Kenya. She was touched
   by one woman who explained why she wanted to be able to space her
   births further apart: "I want to bring every good thing to one child
   before I have another."

   One amazing thing is that parents' desire to bring every good thing to
   their children can have a huge impact on national economies. Melinda
   spoke at the World Bank about how developing countries have a chance to
   benefit from something called the "demographic dividend." The idea is
   that as parents bring their family size down, countries can invest more
   in educating young people. When those young people reach working age,
   they boost productivity and economic growth. South Korea and Thailand
   are two recent examples of how countries that understand and capitalize
   on these principles can rapidly transform their economies.

   Over the next 40 years, the global population is projected to grow at
   just .8 percent per year. It just passed 7 billion and will reach 9.3
   billion by 2050, according to the United Nations' medium estimate.
   However, the populations of most poor countries, which have the hardest
   time feeding and educating their citizens, will more than double
   between now and 2050. If we compare population by continent now and in
   2050, we see that Africa will more than double in population (from 1
   billion to 2.2 billion) while Asia and the Americas will grow by 25
   percent and Europe will hardly grow at all!

   Looking at the numbers at the country level gives an even starker
   picture. To take just one example, Nigeria, which has the biggest
   population in Africa, will grow from 163 million to 392 million--an
   increase of 140 percent. This will likely make the lives of people in
   that very poor country even more difficult.

   Melinda and I believe, though, that if the right steps are taken--not
   just helping women plan their families but also investing in reducing
   child mortality and increasing nutrition--populations in countries like
   Nigeria will grow significantly less than projected. Almost all the
   foundation's global programs focus on goals that will help with this.

    Globally, more than 200 million women say they don't want to have a
   child within the next two years but aren't using contraceptives. If
   families that wanted to wait a longer period between births or have
   fewer children had access to the right tools, two things would happen.
   First, those families would have an easier time facing the challenges
   of poverty. Second, as national population growth rates came down
   gradually, governments would be able to better meet the needs of all
   their people.

   A significant number of women indicate that they would use modern
   family planning tools if they were available. Unfortunately, the
   funding to buy these tools, to make them cheaper, and to provide
   high-quality information to poor families has been lacking.

   The tools that are likely to have the highest adoption rates in
   sub-Saharan Africa are implants or injectables, not the oral
   contraceptives that are popular in the United States. Indonesia has
   made implants broadly available, and more than 1.7 million women are
   using implants today. The foundation has helped fund quality assurance
   for a lower-cost implant, Sinoplant II, which is registered today in
   more than 17 countries and costs 60 percent less than the alternatives.
   We also think that injections can be made cheaper and longer lasting
   and put into a format that women can administer themselves. There are a
   large number of steps required to get new tools not only approved and
   manufactured but also understood so that women can make informed
   choices about contraception. Our goal is that every woman should have
   the ability to choose when she wants to have children. The result will
   be healthier mothers and children and more prosperous nations.

U.S. Education

   Our work in U.S. education focuses on two related goals: making sure
   that all students graduate from high school ready to succeed in college
   and that young adults who want to get a postsecondary degree have a way
   to do so.

   On the K-12 side, our top priority is helping schools implement a
   personnel system that improves the effectiveness of teaching, because
   research shows that effective teaching is the most important in-school
   factor in student achievement. There are a lot of great teachers in
   public schools, and a lot of teachers who want to be great but don‚t
   have the tools they need. If we could make the average teacher as good
   as the best teachers, the benefit to students would be phenomenal.

   A personnel system includes hiring; giving specific feedback; helping
   employees improve; and creating pay schedules, benefit plans, and
   termination procedures. There is consensus that the current personnel
   system in public schools doesn‚t work. Every element of today‚s system
   is criticized. However, there isn‚t a strong consensus on what to
   change. Many states are moving away from guaranteed tenure with pay
   based solely on seniority and what degrees you have. But most of the
   alternative measures do not include much investment in teacher
   evaluation, which makes them very dependent on how good the principal
   is and how well student test scores measure teaching effectiveness.

   I still find it hard to believe that 95 percent of teachers are not
   given specific feedback about how to improve. Even more important than
   a pay schedule that rewards excellence is identifying and understanding
   excellence so that teachers know how they can improve. In all the
   meetings I have had with teachers around the country, and in the
   surveys we have done, it is clear that most teachers want more feedback
   and will use it to improve, even if the financial rewards for
   performance are comparatively modest.

   The most compelling example I have seen that this concept can work in a
   way that is great for both teachers and students is the school district
   of Tampa, Florida that Melinda and I visited this past fall. A key
   element of the agreement between the teachers‚ union and the
   superintendent was to assign 2 percent of the teachers to become peer
   evaluators. These teachers were trained to observe classroom teaching
   and provide feedback on 22 different components. The principals have
   also been trained in this approach. Every teacher gets in-depth
   feedback from both the principal and the peer evaluator.

   Tampa has been doing this for three years now, and it is already making
   a big difference. Teachers told us they value having feedback from two
   different sources‚the principal who knows the school the best and the
   peer who knows the challenges of their specific job. The first round of
   evaluation revealed that many teachers need help engaging the students
   to prompt critical thinking and problem solving. The district started
   to organize its professional development around these findings, and the
   teachers have seized that opportunity to become more effective in the
   classroom.

   When Melinda and I met with students, they told us that they had seen a
   big change during their time at the school. The success here required
   great work by Superintendent Mary Ellen Elia, Classroom Teachers
   Association President Jean Clements, and all of the teachers. I was
   particularly impressed with the peer evaluators. They all said they
   understood great teaching far better, having done the peer evaluation
   job. Some of the peer evaluators will go back to teaching and others
   will go into schools of education to help make sure new teachers have
   better preparation.

   After seeing how valuable peer evaluation is, I think it should be part
   of every public school personnel system. Dedicating 2 percent of
   teachers to do this work is a large investment. It can mean raising the
   average class size by 2 percent or spending 2 percent more money. With
   budgets as tight as they are, most states will not add extra money for
   evaluation so we will have to make the case that it is worth the small
   increase in class size (of fewer than one student per class on
   average). Without this investment I don‚t think an evaluation system
   will get enough credibility with the teachers or provide enough
   specific feedback to help teachers improve. Looking at test scores is
   also valuable for most subjects, but test score data mostly just
   identifies who is succeeding‚it doesn‚t show a teacher what needs to
   change. I see the willingness to make this investment as a test of
   whether people are serious about an evaluation system that really
   works.

   Accelerating the development, discovery, and use of innovative
   educational technologies is another high priority for us. We have seen
   a tremendous amount of progress in this area recently, but it is really
   just the beginning. More needs to be done to equip teachers with the
   tools and information they need to make learning more personalized and
   engaging.

   Social networking is one of the most promising areas, because it helps
   teachers and students connect in ways that naturally augment what‚s
   going on in the classroom. Services that use social networking, like
   Edmodo, are really starting to take off because teachers can manage all
   aspects of the classroom using a platform with which most people are
   comfortable.

   I‚m also excited to see more and more schools ‚flip‚ the classroom so
   that passive activities like lectures are done outside of class and
   in-class time is used for more collaborative and personal interactions
   between students and teachers. Khan Academy is a great example of a
   free resource that any teacher can use to take full advantage of class
   time and make sure all students advance at their own pace.

   Great work is also being done by companies that are thinking beyond
   simply digitizing textbooks. CK-12 Foundation, Udemy, and Ednovo have
   great teacher- and community‚generated content. A simple example of how
   powerful the community can be in this area is TeachersPayTeachers, a
   marketplace that facilitates the sharing and exchanging of lesson plans
   and other materials developed by teachers themselves.

   We‚re also just starting to see how impactful gaming can be in an
   educational context. MangaHigh and Grockit are successfully delivering
   fun, competitive, game-based lessons that drive greater engagement and
   understanding. Zoran Popovic, at University of Washington‚s Center for
   Game Science, is taking this even further through some amazing work
   creating games that automatically adapt to each student‚s unique needs
   based on their interactions with the computer.

   Many of these new tools and services have the added benefit of
   providing amazing visibility into how each individual student is
   progressing, and generating lots of useful data that teachers can use
   to improve their own effectiveness.

   But how do most teachers figure out what‚s available and right for
   them? There‚s not yet a good answer to this question. Good technologies
   remain unused, and teachers spend too much of their own time and money.
   That‚s why I‚m launching a project this year to build an online service
   that helps educators easily discover and learn how to use these new
   tools and resources. I think there‚s no limit to what a teacher with
   the right tools and information can do.

   Jeff Raikes continues to do a great job leading the foundation as CEO.
   Tachi Yamada, who ran our Global Health program, and Sylvia Mathews,
   who ran Global Development, moved on to other jobs, and we thank them
   for their great contributions. Jeff recruited Trevor Mundel to run
   Global Health and Chris Elias to run Global Development. We are very
   excited about the experience and talent they bring to the foundation.
   Our third group, the U.S. Program, which focuses primarily on our U.S.
   education work, continues to be ably run by Allan Golston.

   In June the foundation moved to a new campus. The campus is designed to
   facilitate collaboration, including space for meetings with lots of
   partners on key foundation topics. Melinda worked closely with the
   architecture firm NBBJ to mold the design to fit our work. Already our
   employees are seeing the benefit of being in one location where they
   can collaborate with each other more easily, and they say they really
   value being able to convene grantees and other partners on site.

   My father, William Gates, co-chair along with Melinda and me, continues
   to provide inspiration and guidance for a lot of our work. In June, he
   gave a speech to 10,000 Lions Club members who gathered in Seattle for
   their annual convention. The streets were closed for their parade, and
   then my dad spoke about the Lions' impressive work fighting measles.
   Ten years ago, 2,000 people died from measles every day. Now, that
   number is down to 500. My father, who has always encouraged me, loved
   encouraging an arena full of people to keep saving children's lives.

Giving Pledge

   The Giving Pledge, which entails wealthy individuals and families
   making a simple pledge to give away a majority of their wealth during
   their lifetime or in their will, has already grown to 69 people, which
   is more than we expected when we started. As we began 2012, we heard
   from several people who said they plan to take the pledge very soon.
   We're hopeful that many others will follow. It's inspiring to read
   people's rationale for making the pledge; you can find their letters at
   [121]www.givingpledge.org.

   We brought the group of pledgers together in May for the first of what
   will be an annual gathering to learn from each other. The event was a
   great success. A lot of people found they had goals in common, so even
   as the Giving Pledge celebrates the diversity of giving, it has helped
   spur collaboration. We're starting to see the fruits of that effort, as
   members of the group are now looking at co-funding projects.

   When Warren Buffett, Melinda, and I were in India in March, we sat down
   with around 60 wealthy families to hear from them about Indian
   philanthropy and share our experiences. Azim Premji, one of the
   pioneers of philanthropy in India, joined us for the panel discussion.
   Warren's energy and humor were in strong evidence. When talking about
   whether it would be better for the wealthy to use their money to create
   jobs, Warren noted that even Santa Claus creates jobs by employing the
   elves and reindeer!

   One thing that really struck me in both the Giving Pledge meeting and
   the India get-together is that a key factor holding people back from
   being even more generous is finding philanthropic endeavors that make
   them feel like they are having a significant and unique impact. It has
   me thinking a lot harder about how we can use the web to make it easier
   for givers of all sizes to connect to causes and see the results of
   their giving.

Why I'm Optimistic

   Early in 2011, President Sarkozy of France invited me to write a report
   for the G20 and present it in person at their November meeting in
   Cannes. This was a huge honor, since it is the first time a
   philanthropist has been asked to speak to this group. The organizers
   weren‚t even sure what country to put on my badge since I wasn‚t coming
   as part of the U.S. official delegation. They decided to put ‚Invitee‚
   on my badge, making me briefly the head of government of Invitee!

   My report focused on how the G20 can help ensure that the poorest are
   not forgotten, as rich countries deal with significant economic and
   budget challenges. The report, ‚Innovation with Impact: Financing 21st
   Century Development,‚ is on [126]gatesfoundation.org. It starts by
   describing how much life has improved for the poorest over the past 50
   years. Part of the reason is the aid contributed by rich countries. A
   lot of media attention focused on my suggestions of a modest financial
   transaction tax, increased tobacco taxes, and a carbon tax to support
   aid commitments. None of these ideas has universal agreement, and none
   will solve the problem alone, but they can make a big difference if
   even just a few countries adopt them.

   Overall, however, I tried in the report to paint a picture of the
   incredible diversity of resources available for development. It‚s not
   just rich countries giving aid that are having an impact. I described
   what poor countries themselves are doing to speed their own
   development; I pointed out how rapidly growing countries like Brazil,
   China, and India are bringing new experience and expertise to
   development; and I discussed some ways in which the private sector can
   get involved in improving the lives of the poor and helping countries
   develop. I am excited because innovative partnerships that capitalize
   on the comparative advantages of all these players can accelerate
   progress, speeding the transition beyond aid for many poor countries.

   The G20 conference itself was a microcosm of the challenges that
   leaders face, with the Eurozone crisis taking a lot of their time. I
   was impressed that the leaders took 90 minutes to discuss my report and
   related issues, and I hope they will set aside time for development
   when they meet in Mexico for next year‚s summit.

   Following my presentation, a number of the leaders shared specific
   suggestions for addressing these issues. David Cameron said it would
   make his country‚s leadership on giving .7 percent of gross domestic
   product by 2013 in tough times easier if more countries would do the
   same. I got the strong impression that the leaders themselves are very
   sympathetic to the case that aid budgets should not be cut even as
   governments reduce their spending. However, this will be possible only
   if their constituents understand that aid, which is less than 1 percent
   of the budget in most countries, has a significant impact on people‚s
   lives. I have tried in this letter to make that case. Whether it‚s
   fighting plant disease, treating people with AIDS, or getting a measles
   vaccine to a child in a remote area‚modest investments in the poorest
   make a huge difference.

   Unfortunately, many people believe the opposite‚that money spent on
   development is wasted, or that it doesn‚t get lasting results. Melinda
   and I will spend a lot of time in the coming year explaining why
   they‚re mistaken. The relatively small amount of money invested in
   development has changed the future prospects of billions of people‚and
   it can do the same for billions more if we make the choice to continue
   investing in innovation. We will repeat that message over and over in
   our speeches and interviews, and on [127]gatesfoundation.org and
   [128]gatesnotes.com, because we are convinced that when people hear
   stories of the lives they‚ve helped to improve, they want to do more,
   not less.
