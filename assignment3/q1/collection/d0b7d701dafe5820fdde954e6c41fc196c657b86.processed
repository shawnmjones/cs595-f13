[24]Deja vu all over again: House passes bad CISPA bill

   Shredded paper with word
   Almost exactly [30]one year ago, the House of Representatives passed
   overreaching cybersecurity legislation. Thursday, they did it again,
   passing essentially the same bad bill, 288-127.

   This bill would trump all other privacy laws, all of the other
   protections the government has established for keeping personally
   identifiable and sensitive data--financial records, medical records,
   communication--private. Companies could share any and all of your
   information with the government in the name of national security, and
   there's nothing you could do about it. It was a bad bill last year, and
   it's a bad bill now. That's why the White House has [31]threatened to
   veto this legislation, just like they did last year. (Yes, House
   Republican leadership are slow learners.)

   In the floor debate, House Republicans tried to [32]capitalize on this
   week's tragedies to push the legislation. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX),
   chair of the Homeland Security Committee, said the bill was critical to
   pass because of Boston.

     "I think if anything, the recent events in Boston demonstrate, that
     we have to come together to get this done in name," McCaul said at a
     House hearing where several amendments of the bill were debated. "In
     the case of Boston, they were real bombs. In this case they're
     digital bombs. These bombs are on their way. That's why this
     legislation is so urgent. For if we don't and those digital bombs
     land and attack the United States, and Congress failed to act, then
     Congress has that on his hands."

   That's the kind of over-the-top fear-mongering that the House will use
   to compel the Senate to act quickly. That's the last thing the Senate
   should do. Any bill it passes needs to protect critical infrastructure
   and our privacy.

   [33]Please contact your senators and tell them to reject the House
   CISPA bill.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [52]Tagging tips - [53]Search For Tags - [54]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       bidding, and getting pay for it.
       A systemic imposition of a total-information-awareness police state
       is happening in real-time, right before our eyes.
       By all means, yes contact your Senator, but understand that the
       political establishment as a whole mainly answers to their
       corporatist paymasters.
       Unless and until people organize nationwide to form a resistance
       movement (to the imposition of a Corporate Police State) capable of
       acting in coordinated and strategic fashion, for the long haul, we
       have no chance whatsoever to stop these corporatist cartels from
       cementing their power over the populace.

       And you're right - you'd better keep your eye on him.  He will
       steal any constitutional rights we have left and any free access to
       the commons we still enjoy.  He'll steal them from the people and
       sell them to the private sector, and he'll justify it all with his
       silver tongued oratory especially designed to influence the
       Republican base - both the very rich and the dirt poor.  He's a
       dangerous man.

       how selectively people approve or disapprove of relinquishing their
       right to privacy.  (I mean the Republican voters themselves here,
       not the GOPropagandists.)
       I think it's something to do with compartmentalizing, e.g.: since I
       am a gun owner, anything collecting information on gun owners is
       about ME, whereas anything meant to find malicious hackers or
       terrorists is NOT about me, since I am neither one of those.

       We have a bicameral Congress for a reason. The Senate may operate

       Senate's broken rules, not get rid of the Senate.
       CISPA would have already hit Obama's desk were it not for the U.S.
