[2]Folks Dressed Up Like Eskimos

   ____________________
   Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe helps to make the season
   bright, but not many people know how Eskimos dress.
   Eskimos (in Canada, at least) generally prefer to be referred to as
   Inuit, which means "people" in Inuktitut, the language of the Inuit.
   Inuit have a variety of modes of dress.
   This website shows you the diversity of Inuit style, so you can
   visualize it better, when you hear the song during this Christmas
   season.
   Let's challenge the stereotypes! Email me your pictures at

   Nakurmiik!!

[9]An open letter to the CFL and the Ottawa football team owners

   I am very much looking forward to the CFL's return to Canada's capital.
   Football holds a special place in the history and heart of our
   beautiful city. I'm confident that the new team will be a source of
   excitement and pride for thousands of fans.
   Though there are rumors of a new name, as of today, the team has not
   yet chosen its moniker.
   The CFL has previously demonstrated its comfort with duplicating team
   names. While Ottawa is indeed home to a significant Inuit population,
   I'd discourage duplicating Edmonton's CFL team name. Similarly, even
   though there are many First Nations people here on Algonquin Unceded
   Territory, I'd also suggest you steer clear of duplicating Nepean's
   name: "the Redskins".
   If you need to duplicate a team name, why not go with the
   "Roughriders". Saskatchewan was ok with it before, maybe they will be
   again, and it could help us recall an exciting era for football in this
   great city.

   [12]Special edition, off-season Eskimo post. However, it is important
   to note that Inuit remained clothed in various styles throughout the
   year. My friend Janice sent in this photo. She said,
   &#8220;here&#8217;s one of me in my emilyandfin dress and aldo
   shoes.&#8221;

   [15]I met Kathleen (on the right) playing volleyball. She&#8217;s
   really good, and her team always kicks my team&#8217;s ass. She sent me
   this picture: &#8220;I always dress for comfort, but often you will
   find me accessorizing with sealskin. Left of me is my friend Kristi
   from Norway&#8217;s Riddu Riddu festival.&#8221;

   Here's my friend Victoria, who is originally from Kangirsuk in Nunavik,
   but now lives in Greenland. I'm glad to have some Greenland Eskimo
   representation on the blog! Thanks, Victoria! Victoria once told me
   that I reminded her very much of my Uncle Bob. I guess she wasn't too
   far off the mark. See this. ([24]CLICK)

   On the left is a photo of Victoria in Nuuk, Greenland, which her friend
   Dida took. Victoria didn't describe her outfit in this photograph.
   However, I can tell she is wearing appropriate clothing for the weather
   and conditions she was in at the time.

   On the right is a photo of Victoria in a Christmas Party dress with a
   pair of angel wings.

   [37]Here is a picture of my friend Lisa. She&#8217;s pretty awesome. In
   this photo, she&#8217;s skating on a forest path in Ste Catherine de la
   Jacques Cartier. Side note: Cartier was one of the first
   &#8220;explorers&#8221; from France to come to North America/Turtle
   Island, and he met the Haudenosaunee people. You can see the real life
   reenactment here.  Lisa provided this photo with the description
   below.  "I am using my skates from Canadian Tire, acrylic scarf that I
   initially thought was made of wool and it isn&#8217;t, my down filled
   parka was a gift from my mother 30 years ago and I&#8217;ve changed the
   fox fur around the hood since. My "NorthFace" windproof pants are
   actually from a Sherpa shop in the Himalayas.  My mittens are from a
   Hunter Support shop in one of the communities I&#8217;ve been to in
   Nunavik and my hat is an Ivakkak dog team race promotional item I got
   for free!"
