Do Democrats have a shot at the McCotter seat?

   Now that GOP Rep. Thad McCotter has pulled the plug on a possible
   write-in campaign and decided not to run, the next question is whether
   Democrats have a shot at picking up a seat that had until recently been
   considered safely Republican in November.

   The answer seems to be sort of.

   [45]Alex Isenstadt writes on the home page:

     The congressman's departure has opened the door for Democrats to
     compete for a seat that had once been considered safely Republican.
     While the GOP enjoys a significant voter registration advantage in
     the southeast Michigan-area district, the party faces the
     complicated task of nominating a candidate capable of waging a
     serious campaign.

     The sole Republican whose name will appear on the primary ballot
     will be Kerry Bentivolio, a tea-party-aligned teacher and Vietnam
     War veteran who has struggled to raise money. And [former GOP state
     Sen. Loren] Bennett, who launched his bid on Friday, could face
     competition from other Republicans running as write-in candidates.

     Democratic officials said they were beginning to assess their
     prospects in the district, though they acknowledged winning there
     remained a challenge. The leading Democratic candidate, physician
     Syed Taj, had previously received little attention from party
     strategists.

     In a phone interview on Sunday, Taj said he had not yet heard from
     the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

   The Republican-oriented suburban Detroit seat, anchored in Oakland and
   Wayne counties, is a bit of a stretch for Democrats -- which explains
   why Taj hasn't heard from D.C. yet.

   But the seat isn't out of reach and a lot is going to depend on which
   Republicans decide to mount write-in campaigns and how they fare. If
   Bentivolio, an unknown candidate who's raised only $61,000, ends up as
   the GOP nominee, Democrats will be forced to take a long look at the
   11th District because the opportunity might be too good to pass up.
