   Gary Miller
   Rep. Gary Miller (R-CA), whose career was saved by California's open
   primaries in 2012.
   If the man in the photo above is someone that you fail to recognize,
   you are forgiven. For over a decade now, Republican Congressman Gary
   Miller has been the epitome of the nondescript, archconservative
   Republican politician, plying his trade in the rolling hills and
   valleys in a tri-county area roughly 25 miles east of Los Angeles.

   For most of his career, Miller's district was so conservative (two of
   the largest cities within the district were blood red communities in
   northern Orange County: Mission Viejo and Yorba Linda) that he would be
   carried to victory with minimal effort. From his initial election in
   1998 until his final win under the old lines in 2010, Miller's average
   vote total (not counting an unopposed run in 2006) was 62 percent of
   the vote.

   Then, in 2011, Miller's world got considerably worse. The newly created
   [30]California Citizens Redistricting Commission carved up Miller's
   comfortable district, leaving him with the less-than-agreeable choice
   of diving into a neighboring district already held by a Republican
   incumbent, or moving into the one open district that had any of his
   previous district's constituents: the newly minted 31st district.

   The problem? Miller could no longer count on a reliably conservative
   district. The new 31st district went 56-41 for Barack Obama in 2008,
   and Democrats immediately put Miller onto a document he had never seen
   before in his 14 years: the DCCC target list.

   Alas, two years later, Miller is still a member of the House of
   Representatives. A citizen initiative (the redistricting commission)
   almost cost him his career. But it was another citizen initiative--the
   concept of holding "open" primaries--that saved him.

   Read beyond the fold for how Miller's job was salvaged, how Republicans
   have almost benefitted from this elsewhere, and why they will almost
   certainly do so again.

   In 2010, the voters passed [31]Proposition 14, a measure to install a
   "top-two" primary system in California.

   Under a "top-two" primary structure, all candidates for a particular
   political office, regardless of party, appear on the same ballot, which
   is distributed to all voters. Then, the top two vote-getters advance to
   the general election. Again, this is regardless of party, making it
   possible for the general election to be a faceoff between two
   Republicans, or alternately, two Democrats.

   One of the chief authors of this measure was an organization called the
   Independent Voter Project. One of the stated purposes was to strengthen
   the hand of independent (or, as they refer to them in California,
   "Decline to State") voters:

     The Top Two Open Primary forces candidates to face all voters,
     including independents, in both the primary and the general
     elections. In most communities, this means that candidates and
     elected officials will have to answer to, and appeal to, a broader
     electorate rather than to the more narrow interests that can
     dominate low turnout primaries.

   With [32]27 percent of the electorate in California registered outside
   of the Democratic-Republican duopoly, and the popularity of the two
   parties at a low ebb even among their own members in many cases, the
   [33]measure passed in the spring of 2010 with 54 percent of the vote.

   2012 was the first statewide election under the new primary structure,
   and just a few hours after the polls closed, the first palpable
   problems with the system became readily apparent. And the
   aforementioned Gary Miller was at the center of it.

   Miller was not given a free ride from his fellow Republicans in his bid
   for a seventh term in the House. Veteran state legislator Bob Dutton
   challenged Miller in the reconfigured district, in which Miller
   retained only a fraction of his old district (the part that lies within
   San Bernardino County).

   Miller's salvation, however, lay on the Democratic side. With the
   district being a legitimate Democratic target, a quartet of serious
   contenders decided to run for the seat, led by Redlands Mayor Pete
   Aguilar. Even in the GOP-heavy primary vote (47 percent of the primary
   vote was cast in the GOP presidential primary, versus just 51 percent
   in the Democratic presidential primary), the Democrats were very nearly
   at parity with the GOP in terms of total votes in the district.

   And, yet, when the top two "golden tickets" were punched for November,
   there was not a Democrat to be found in the top two. In an ironic
   flurry of unintended consequences, two things that would ordinarily be
   seen as perilous for Miller wound up being his ticket to re-election.

   The serious Republican challenger, in the form of former state Sen.
   Dutton, wound up being a godsend, because they almost evenly split the
   52 percent of the electorate that voted GOP. When the [34]official
   results were tallied, Miller had notched 27 percent of the vote, with
   Dutton hot on his heels at 25 percent of the vote.

   Meanwhile, the renewed interest in the purple-to-blue district among
   Democrats also saved Miller's bacon, because none of the four
   contenders was utterly dominant on the Democratic side of the ledger.
   Aguilar was able to get nearly half of the votes cast among Democrats,
   but former Hill staffer Justin Kim did fairly well in his own right,
   while frequent state legislative candidate Renea Wickman and Rita
   Ramirez-Dean both scored in the mid-single digits. The net result?
   Aguilar wound up with 22.6 percent of the vote, good enough only for
   third place.

   Thus, despite the fact that a majority of district voters had cast
   their ballots for Barack Obama in 2008 (and would do so again, even
   more decisively, in 2012), the general election for the U.S. House
   would give area voters a choice between ... two Republicans.
   Interestingly, one school of thought (which I share) is that this also
   worked in Miller's favor. Occasionally tinged with scandal (and also
   diminished by the general anti-incumbent mood), it seems likely that
   Democratic voters sided with him over Dutton in November, rationalizing
   that it will be easier to beat the damaged Miller in 2014 than the more
   benign Dutton, who Miller defeated 55-45 in November.

   A similar scenario could well play out in 2014 in the very same
   district, among the bluest districts in America held by a Republican
   incumbent. Once again, there is already a quartet of legitimate
   Democratic candidates in place trying to claim the California 31st.
   Aguilar is back for a second shot at the brass ring, and to his credit,
   he is the only one that has raised serious cash. However, all three of
   his opponents have at least the potential to be players by next spring.
   Most prominent among these is former Rep. Joe Baca, who served in the
   House for well over a decade until his defeat last November at the
   hands of Gloria Negrete McLeod in the neighboring 35th district. Add
   local school board member Danny Tillman, and attorney Eloise Gomez
   Reyes, and the Democratic field in the 31st is taking on the appearance
   of a clown car yet again. Thus far, the only saving grace is that
   Miller appears to be the only other candidate running. If that holds,
   the Democrats will get a spot in the November runoff in spite of
   themselves, and Miller will be assuredly become a top-tier target for
   the DCCC.

   The same scenario came dangerously close to occurring again on the
   state legislative level this past week. In a special election to
   replace Democrat Norma Torres (who was recently elected to the state
   Senate) in AD-52, seven Democrats filed for the seat, along with a
   Republican Dorothy Pineda and "Independent" candidate Paul Leon, the
   mayor of Ontario, who was last seen only a few months ago as the
   Republican challenger to Norma Torres in that state Senate special
   election.

   Early in the evening, the folly of the top-two system was looming.
   Democrats combined for right around 60 percent of the vote, but because
   their votes were spread fairly evenly, and there were only two
   Republicans (open or concealed) in the mix, a scant 35 votes separated
   Democrat Freddie Rodriguez from Republican Dorothy Pineda, with
   "independent" Paul Leon well out in front. Rodriguez, thankfully,
   pulled away, coming in second in the open primary with 22 percent of
   the vote. He will be the strong favorite in the special general
   election, since Democrats combined for 60.3 percent of the votes in
   [35]round one. But this could've been disastrous, and in defiance of
   popular will, yet again.

   In fact, the ability for Rodriguez to make the runoff and face Leon was
   based largely on a raft of early money that had to be spent on his
   behalf. Rodriguez, a city councilman from among the largest cities in
   the district (Pomona), had [36]over $350,000 in independent
   expenditures spent on his behalf in the closing weeks of the election.
   This wave of cash from party coffers and those of sympathetic groups
   like the teachers' union, which ordinarily would be reserved for a
   general election. But those organizations felt compelled to dump some
   early money into the race, in order to ensure that Rodriguez even made
   it to the general election.

   Interestingly, I predicted that this might happen in a post-mortem that
   I wrote about the new California primary system over [37]thirteen
   months ago:

     If one of the rationales for this system was to weaken the influence
     of political parties, it may have failed miserably. Because one has
     to assume now that parties in 2014 will be working double time to
     clear the decks for their preferred candidates in the filing
     process. Whether it is indirect "take one for the team pressure," or
     a raft of party assistance being dropped in the laps of the favored
     horses in the field, one has to guess that the sting of losing a
     winnable district will compel the Democrats (and the GOP, if they
     were paying close attention) to interfere more in the primary
     process, not less.

   Another inherent flaw in the "top two" structure is that it drains
   resources that could otherwise be used to further party goals. Nowhere,
   and I mean nowhere, was this more apparent than in Southern
   California's San Fernando Valley, where the epic "Shberman" showdown
   occurred last November between veteran Democratic incumbents Howard
   Berman and Brad Sherman. The two Washington stalwarts, both of whom
   have been there for over 15 years, were the runaway top-two votegetters
   in June in this heavily Democratic slice of Los Angeles County. That
   necessitated an ugly, and absurdly expensive, repeat in November, one
   easily won by Sherman with over 60 percent of the vote.

   When all was said and done, however, these two Democrats had spent over
   [38]$11.9 million trying to beat...each other. One suspects that money,
   donated by Democrats, could've been better used elsewhere.

   Even the stated goal of trying to bring Independent voices into the mix
   seems to have failed. Among the staunchest critics of the new system,
   as it happened, were those who work with [39]third parties like the
   Greens and Libertarians. Their complaint? The new system essentially
   knocks them out of the box in June, when only a fraction of the state's
   registered voters even bother to show up at the polls.

   The open primary system was well-intentioned, but as the old saying
   goes, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. If voters are not
   willing to scrap the primary structure all together, it needs several
   fixes to it, at a minimum. A party should never be penalized for
   encouraging multiple candidates to seek an office, so a logical
   starting point would be to eliminate the possibility of a single party
   holding both general election positions. Time will tell if the two
   major political parties, or merely those interested in solid
   representative governance, will try to put a measure to that effect on
   the ballot.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

       I don't think independents want "their own" party.  Mostly, they
       just want a voice in the process.  And when parties try to close
       the process, a lot of voters don't like it, and they may take steps
       to open it up again.  That's what led to the top-two primary in
       Washington.

 One solution could be to take the top 3 ([181]0+ / 0-)
       vote-getters from the open primary and put them in the general
       election.  It could allow an non-aligned candidate into the

       general.

   It sounds good on the surface -- until you start thinking about it for
   more than a minute.

   Also, I don't see how, if the state has a mandated primary system, a
   caucus by one party can be made to stick. Party caucus losers could
   still enter he primary, couldn't they?

       Prop 13 easily qualifies as the dumbest thing California has ever
       done. It took all power away from local districts (schools,
       libraries, ect) and municipalities and gave it to Sacramento.
       Granted, term limits have made a hash there, too, but now all money
       has to flow thru the state to get to local governing bodies.
       It also scewed the tax rolls. At the time, and for decades, the
       property tax had been evenly split between business and residential
       properties. Now residents pay 61% and business only 39% because
       they do not sell as often. And ANYTHING you do to fix that is
       considered anti-business.

   ...is because if you live in a political subdivision that is dominated
   by the "other" party, you end up with no say in who gets elected.

   In my case, I'm in a solidly Republican area, which means that whoever
   wins the Republican primary is going to win the general election.  The
   only way to have a say is to vote in the Republican primary -- and in
   off year elections, that is what I tend to do so that I can have some
   sort of say in the election.  The open primary resolves this problem.

   And frankly, what happened in the congressional district that is the
   focus of this diary looks to me like screw ups that shouldn't be blamed
   on the open primary system.  If 52% of the primary voters in a
   Democratic leaning district voted for the two Republicans, that
   suggests to me that the Democratic party did a very poor job of getting
   out it's voters.  That's the fault of the local Democratic party, not
   the primary system.

     make it to the general election in open primaries, a chance that
     they almost never have in partisan general elections.
       I'd think the result would be exactly the opposite; an open primary
       restricts the general-election ballot to two candidates, while a
       conventional primary system allows any third party with ballot
       access or enough petition signatures to be on the general-election
       ballot.
       Had an open primary been implemented nationwide in the 2012
       election, few if any Americans would have had the option to vote
       for any candidates from the Green Party, Libertarian Party,
       Constitution Party, or other third parties in the general
       election--just Democratic and Republican candidates.
       I don't think the open primary system benefits third parties in any
       way, shape, or form.
       Know what would? Removing the 435-member limit on the size of the
       House of Representatives, and going to a 100,000:1
       citizen:representative ratio (about 3,500 members)--which would
       make legislative districts much smaller and make it much easier for
       organized citizen groups to mount legitimate challenges to
       representatives who displease them.

       they would not be spoilers, but the real candidates with a real
       opportunity to win.
       I would support a 600-750 member House which has multi-member
       districts in all states that have more than one House member. 3,500

   chance in top 2 primaries UNLESS there is: instant runoff/ranked voting
   where people are more apt to vote for who they really want first
   (despite the odds) rather than the lesser of evils  with a perceived
   chance of winning ...who would now become their second choice.   But
   since we do not have instant run off available except in a few
   places...that is almost irrelevant.

   Things to consider about any primaries:
   A) Smaller number of voters in primaries
   B) Usually they are the most committed to a cause or party.
   C) Less media attention to issues
   D) The less involved/informed voters don't pay much attention until
   after the primaries...

   Party primaries assure that even third party candidates will be on the
   election ballot and they can be a part of the discussion at a time when
   more voters become interested: going into the election.

   But even if we have Party Primaries...we should still have
   ranked/instant runoff in both the primaries and any  election where
   more than two candidates are in the running.

   It only eliminates third parties if no third party outdraws either the
   Republicans or the Democrats.  For example, if the Democrat gets 35
   percent, the third-party candidate gets 31 percent, and the Republican
   28 percent, the ballot will be the Democrat versus the third-party
   candidate.

   Historically, that hasn't been the usual scenario in elections that
   feature third parties (and never at all in Presidential elections).
   But it's much more plausible on the district level, especially in a
   time when the popularity of the Big Two is declining.

   If anything, I'd say that despite its obvious flaws, the top-two system
   is probably fairer to third parties than the current one, which always
   seems to hamstring them with lots of artificial requirements about
   money and signatures.

   There is no guarantee that the two top candidates will represent the

   Take it out of the mix and you lower voter turnout because the election

       First, the idea of party ID as a reflection of the candidate's

       Second, I don't know why you say that elections seem less

       personally, I haven't found it to be particularly true.
       Finally, both major parties, no less than splintery third parties,
       have become highly adept at running "stealth candidates" (who turn
       out immediately after election not to believe the things they ran
       on).  Indeed, the modern art of campaigning amounts largely to
       persuading the broadest possible swath of the electorate that the
       candidate shares their views.  By its nature, that is least a
       somewhat deceptive enterprise.  And the broader the success, the

       If you are a high info voter, who goes to every forum and
       researches every candidate for every position party ID might be
       completely irrelevent, but that's not how most people work.
       And party ID has become more relevent because despite your
       dissatisfaction with the degree of demarcation between parties,
       there are clear issues where the divide is a short hand.  There is
       a much more clear party line and a much more cohesive party block
       at practically all levels of government than there was decades ago.
        The label means more.  You're less likely to vote for a D and get
       Gene Taylor.  You're less likely to vote for an R and get Lincoln
       Chaffee.
       When it comes to city council, the soil and water commission,
       school board, sheriffs, judges (though elected judges is a whole
       other debate) a party affiliation might seem unneccessary because
       of course everyone sees each other at the same general store, they
       all talked to the candidate at the county fair, read the local
       county paper and everyone knows Molly is more liberal than Jim, but
       than there is the majority of voters who are going in blind, if
       they are lucky clutching their party sample ballot to do a vote
       more sophisticated than "I'm Irish, Jim's name is Irish, vote for
       Jim."  When the party doesn't matter it is much harder to put "I
       love my wife, look at my lovely children, isn't our state grand,
       puppies and kittens" candidates in context, and the stealth is a
       lot less likely to be caught out.
       We might like to think we have an informed electorate, that all
       voters know the position between everyone with a line on the
       ballot, but that is universally not true even in the highest
       profile (pres and senate) races, and soil and water board- forget

       That is exactly what I did: register Republican, vote Democratic.
       So, your solution, since it's based on considerable cynicism, is
       open to use (or abuse if you choose) today anywhere. Simply
       register for the other party and vote in the general your true
       affiliation.
       I cannot remember voting for a Republican outside of the primary.
       The only reason I became a Democrat, was Barack Obama: the only
       candidate the Democrats have put up since Kennedy that I felt even
       remotely comfortable supporting.
       I remember watching the Democratic presidential challengers
       debating: Paul Tsongas, Jerry Brown and several others including
       Bill Clinton. I was praying for anyone but Clinton. Look what I
       got. I voted for Bill twice.
       There is a lot more to the story than "open primaries" and I think
       Steve S. needs to sharpen his pencil just a bit and dig in to see
       why a district that Barack Obama carried by 62% found 52% voting
       Republican in the general congressional district.
       I like open primaries. Period. Ranked voting would be even better.

       Washington generally sided with the Federalists (even if he wasn't

       that it really wasn't supposed to try to influence congress at all,
       and only veto bills that are blatantly unconstitutional, rather
       than take any active role in governance.
       Factions are an inevitable part of any democracy, and that's a good
       thing, people have legitimate disagreements with each other and a
       stake in getting legislation passed that advances their own policy
       goals (and that others want to stop).

       It doesn't fix the radicalization problem. If the GOP has a

       district is strongly-enough GOP leaning the Teahadist wins even if
       most people don't like him because there will be enough moderate
       Republicans who won't vote for the Democrat.
       In the California primary, there are several from each party
       running in the primary. Maybe the Democrats get shut out, but a
       moderate Republican gets a shot at the Teahadist.
       As long as Boehner refuses to approach this rationally, there is no
       current advantage to having a moderate Republican in the House
       instead of a crazy, but in normal times moderate Republicans can be

   First - the Democrats need to be better disciplined. Period.

   There should be heavy repercussions for Democrats that pack the field

   Second - I don't think Prop 14 - the Open Primary proposition was "well

   It was heavily supported by Ade Maldanado and Schwarzenegger.

     A big beneficiary is Lieutenant Governor Abel Maldonado, who
     insisted the proposition be placed on the ballot in return for

   Living in a dark-red state, and living in a bunch of... well... not
   quite dark-red Congressional and legislative districts (though, I do
   live in a closely-divided county), you immediately see the problem with
   the alternative system.  8 percent of the voting-age population voted
   in the Republican Senate primary last year, and when that's tantamount
   to election, you wind up with a Senator who appeals to roughly the 8
   percent of the population that votes in the Republican primary.

   I'm imagining an alternative under the open primary, where you might
   wind up with two Republicans facing off in the general election in
   November, but at least in that situation Democrats can make a
   difference.  The standard party primary system, in a safe state or
   district, is what allows politicians like Ted Cruz to thrive.

       probably split with Democrats and independents essentially deciding
       the election.
       In swingy or even in districts that slightly lean to one party or
       the other, the open primary might make things worse, but then in
       those districts the closed primary/general election system works
       reasonably well.

         An initiative is a law that is put before voters by collecting

       legislature. If a law is passed by the legislature that people
       don't want, then they can get signatures to put a referendum on the
       ballot for voters to "veto" it.
            These terms have specific meanings in electoral politics;
       misusing them just causes confusion. Top Two was put on the ballot
       by a vote of the legislature (in the aforementioned Maldo budget
       deal). It was most definitely not an initiative!

   That said, I'm not sure the distinction between an Initiative and a

   which argument is more persuasive to a majority of voters.  And in all

   A "top two" system will often create some head-scratchers, but the idea

 We got the Open Primary System in Washington ([854]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [855]rlochow, [856]roadbear

   because the voters reacted negatively to over-reach by the parties, the
   GOP and the Dems acting in concert. We do not have registration by
   party in WA and our primaries for decades allowed voters to pick
   whichever party ballot they wished. The parties decided they wanted to
   kill cross-over voting and sued to force voters to pledge to vote for
   the party in the general if they chose the party's ballot in the
   primary.  The parties lost in court.  Then they tried to dictate the
   party choice of candidates, only candidates certified by the parties
   would get the party designation on the primary ballot, and lost again
   in court. At that point an initiative was passed for the Open Primary
   because of voter disgust with parties' attempts to manipulate the
   established primary system. It was a huge mistake by the voters, but an
   understandable reaction to a perceived power grab by the parties.  In
   retrospect the parties ended up in a much worse position than they had
   before bringing the lawsuits. In addition to all the problems
   enumerated by the Diarist, the open primary effectively eliminated all
   third parties from contention in our general elections.

       if I thought there were a significant third party to be
       "destroyed".  But when third-party candidates get only single-digit
       percentages under the traditional system, I'd say the voters aren't
       finding reasons to support them, regardless of the voting system.
       For whatever it's worth, in the 2012 WA state legislative elections
       (98 house seats & 26 senate races), there were 9 third-party or "No
       party preference" candidates who made it into the Top Two, and thus
       onto the November ballot.  They included one Green, one Socialist,
       one "(R) Hope & Change Party", and 6 who called themselves
       Independent or said "No Party Preference."
       In addition, there was one "Independent-GOP" (who lost), and one
       "Independent-Dem" (who won).
       In 25 cases, a single major-party candidate ran unopposed, so a
       third-party candidate could have made it to the November ballot
       just by filing.  And in 14 races the Top Two candidates were in the
       same party.

 Seems like an easy solution, if the ([893]0+ / 0-)

       they'd drop out and endorse the front-running Dem a week before the
       vote, given a party-run poll that showed them trailing the
       front-runner by X points.
       So you run like hell against each other until the final week. The
       state party polls the race. If you're back by 10 percent in a
       three-Dem race, 5 percent in a five-Dem race, whatever, you've
       agree to endorse one of the two front-runners. Or something.
       My specifics sucks, but I agree that this seems like a party

   with the legitimacy of this system. Part of me thinks that there should
   be some sort of minimum vote total before you can advance to the next
   round and some sort of minimum before being disqualified. In other
   words, until someone cracks, say, 35 percent of the vote, they don't
   get a spot on the ballot. And if someone gets less than 5 percent, they
   don't get a chance to compete again. I don't know about the practical
   limitations of this idea--it could get expensive to keep having primary
   elections, among other things--but we wouldn't see a system where
   someone could advance to the final round with 25 percent of the vote.

 Second Ballot system ([906]0+ / 0-)
       It sounds like you are thinking of something like the French
       electoral system. The exact details differ by office and have been
       changed from time to time.
       The Wikipedia article on the Two-round system gives some details.

     In both rounds of an election conducted using runoff voting, the
     voter simply marks an "X" beside his/her favorite candidate. If no
     candidate has an absolute majority of votes (i.e. more than half) in
     the first round, then the two candidates with the most votes proceed
     to a second round, from which all others are excluded. In the second
     round, because there are only two candidates, one candidate will
     achieve an absolute majority. In the second round each voter is
     entirely free to change the candidate he votes for, even if his
     preferred candidate has not yet been eliminated but he has merely
     changed his mind.
     Some variants of the two round system use a different rule for
     choosing candidates for the second round, and allow more than two
     candidates to proceed to the second round. Under these systems it is
     sufficient for a candidate to receive a plurality of votes (i.e.
     more votes than anyone else) to be elected in the second round. In
     elections for the French National Assembly any candidate with fewer
     than 12.5% of the total vote is eliminated in the first round, and
     all remaining candidates are permitted to stand in the second round,
     in which a plurality is sufficient to be elected. Under some
     variants of runoff voting there is no formal rule for eliminating
     candidates, but, rather, candidates who receive few votes in the
     first round are expected to withdraw voluntarily. Historically, the
     President of Weimar Germany was popularly elected in 1925 and 1932
     by a two-round system that in the second round allowed any candidate
     to run and did not require an absolute majority. In both elections
     the Communist candidate Ernst Thälmann did not withdraw and ran in
     the second round; in 1925 this probably ensured the election of Paul
     von Hindenburg (with only 48.3% of the vote), rather than Wilhelm
     Marx, the candidate of the centre parties.
       The system is usually used in countries with multiple parties which
       might potentially win an election, but there seems no reason why it
       could not be used for multiple candidates from a single party.

   To cherry pick an undesirable result among the majority as a reason to
   decry the election process is wrong.

   In California's last election the Republican Party was further beaten
   to the curb. In our Golden State it's "GOP Who?"

   The "folly" of open primaries is bound to produce results you and I do
   not like, just as it is bound to do the opposite -- JUST LIKE THE OLD
   SYSTEM.

   The old system gave us, reliably, one Democrat and one Republican.
   Sometimes that worked well, sometimes it gave us Frick & Frack, or
   Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum.

   The new system allows the result of the old system, as well as other
   combinations. We might even see a progressive emerge to replace the

 Thank you for this analysis and example ([933]0+ / 0-)

   How fixable is the plan?

   Would this work? Open primary but top pick of any party that

   That would open up the field to any pol that can rouse independent
   voters and peel off enough disaffected R or D votes in favor of 3rd
   party challengers.

   Might that be a path back to electing moderates?

   It might work if each 3rd party candidate had to choose in advance
   which party they will caucus with. Without that advance commitment, a
   small number of independent or 3rd party seats could wield
   disproportionate power if 2, 3, or 5 seats end up deciding which party
   is the majority party.

 Some other aspects to think about ([936]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [937]codairem

   As I see it, much of the bad result of what has gone on here is a
   failure of the Democratic Party to think strategically.  Seems to me
   the party ought to have enough leverage to get the single-digit
   candidates who end up being spoilers to drop out of some of these
   races.  Also, a demonstrable result of the top-two plus the
   redistricting is that we have more Democrats, but worse Democrats than
   before - at least in the state legislature - which in a way was a goal
   of the process, but an unhappy result from my standpoint.  When most of
   the districts were gerrymandered to be safe for one party or the other,
   most of our Dems were pretty progressive.  But the Republicans, for all
   their failings, have been more strategic than the Dems about funneling
   money to "business" Democrats in districts where a Republican can't
   win.  So we have more Democrats, but many of them will vote with the
   Dems on social issues, side with the big business interests on money
   related issues.  In a district like mine, which is safe Republican, but
   not by an overwhelming majority, the Dems ought to be able do coalesce
   around a more moderate, sane Republican who could be peeled off to vote
   with the Dems on some issues.  But that will never happen because the
   party doesn't seem to think that way - or maybe because there aren't
   any sane Republicans, but there are plenty of squishy Dems available
   happy to take Republican support.

       The far right took over the republican Party in CA in the mid 90s

       or left the party completely. If the far right had not taken over
       their party Tom Campbell would have beaten Barbara Boxer in the
       1998 Senate  race, but like many sane republicans now , Campbell
       never made it to the general election because a radical republican
       named Dan Lungren beat him in the primary.
       There is no new generation of sane republicans nationwide because
       in the mid 90 all the candidates trained to run for office locally,
       statewide who have  now moved up to run for national office were
       recruited and trained to run for office by the Christian Coalition
       led by Ralph Reed. The CC also recruited and trained the activist

 While I agree there are no sane Republicans... ([945]0+ / 0-)
       ... You ave some of the facts wrong. Tom Campbell ran for Senate in
       1992 and got beat in the primary by Bruce Herschensohn, who went on
       to lose to Barbara Boxer.
       Dan Lungren ran for Governor in 1998, losing to Gray Davis. And
       yes, Lungren is a conservative jerk, who thankfully got turfed out
       of Congress last cycle.
       As for the assertion that Campbell would have beaten Boxer, that's
       hard to say. He did do a better job of selling the "moderate
       Republican" bullshit that they bother with in CA anymore.

 sorry my mistakea about Campbell ([953]0+ / 0-)
       En though I am a storing supporter of Boxer, I was involved in CA
       pro-choice politics at the time.
       Many moderate republicans (no independents) vote for Feinstein,
       however they do not vote for Boxer. Boxer was lucky that Campbell
       got beat in the primary because even some moderate pro-business
       Democrats my have voted for him, as he was strongly pro-choice.

 1998 primaries ([957]0+ / 0-)

      Lungren ran for Gov, not Senate in 1998. He got the GOP nomination
   and lost to the aptly named "Gray" Davis. The GOP candidate for Senator
   against Babs that year was Matt Fong, the one-term CA Treasurer. Fong
   was a relative moderate for a Repub. His mother, March Fong Eu, was a
   Democratic legislator who went on to be Secretary of State for about 20
   years (before term limits).

         If any Repub was going to beat Boxer it was Fong but obviously he
   did not succeed. Our dark haired Senator from Marin County was replaced
   by a blonde from Palm Springs; Boxer moved and dyed her hair...

         Campbell ran against DiFi in 2000, got the nomination but lost
   the general election in a landslide.  He also ran in '92 but lost the
   GOP nomination to Bruce Herschenson, a right-winger. That time the
   spoiler candidate was Sonny Bono, another moderate, who split that part
   of the GOP electorate. Bono was Mayor of Palm Springs and had name
   recognition from his previous career as a singer, songwriter and actor.
   There used to be some moderate GOPers in the 20th century. You might be
   mixing '92 up with '98.

 Well, The First Trial Run ([975]0+ / 0-)
       in a number of state-wide and U.S. rep races, I saw the progressive
       make a big run and ask for money (i.e. Norman Solomon and Tori
       Osborne) but when the dust settled, they didn't make the top two.
       We could say well progressives didn't turn out but a low cost
       grassroots campaign vs. big campaign money makes it exceptionally
       difficult in a primary that always will have lower turnout.  Only
       in a truly progressive assembly district such as mine where we had
       Abel Guillen against Bonta and Guillen did come close-- but that
       was the exception as most of the state is not like Oakland and
       Berkeley.  We could say that we need better turnout at primaries
       and that may solve the problem but for now, I'm deeply skeptical.
       Yes, Pete Stark should have retired last year and his incumbency
       did get challenged and he lost, but seeing Mike Honda being
       challenged next year from the center/right makes me deeply
       skeptical, and makes me glad I voted against "top two."  I thought
       it was a bad ideal then and so far, I haven't seen that much that
       makes me optimistic except a progressive I know and admired come
       close to the general election while two others got drowned out due
       to big money and never had the chance one would hope with "top
       two."  Unless, you're in an Oakland and Berkeley, do not expect a
       chance for a more progressive candidate or a younger progressive
       candidate taking out the entrenched incumbency.

   ideologically similar) will progress to the general.

   I don't think top two leads to more fluke outcomes than do 3rd party
   candidates.  Washington State has had top 2 for 3(?) cycles now and
   California one and there has been 1 "Fluke" outcome on a federal level.
   Living in a state with a strong 3rd party tradition I am used to seeing
   races decided with the winner getting less than 50% and the most
   important thing in a close election is if the Independence Party
   candidate draws more votes from the Democrat or Republican.  Give me
   Top 2 anyday.

   Recommended by:

   I voted against the open primary, or run-off, measure for exactly this
   reason.  I don't see the benefit, at all.  It discourages candidates
   from running and actually puts more pressure on the party structure to
   control who runs for office.  The more disciplined party will be
   favored, and "rogue" candidates will be shunned and brought down,
   regardless of whether or not they're viable candidates.

   I'm proud of our new more democratic redistricting process, but not so
   much of the run-off system.

   "open primary" has usually meant that a voter could vote for any

   The winner of each party's primary then advances to the General
   election.

   "top two" means that only two candidates reach the general election.

     A party should never be penalized for encouraging multiple

     to eliminate the possibility of a single party holding both general
     election positions.

   Almost certainly the 'top two regardless of party' is the only reason I

   not a bug. Miller's Democratic would-be challengers simply need to sort
