Area 51 officially acknowledged, mapped in newly released documents

   By Laura Koran, CNN
   updated 9:04 PM EDT, Fri August 16, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * The CIA officially acknowledges Area 51, long a fixation for
       conspiracy theorists, in documents
     * The area, 125 northwest of Las Vegas, was a testing ground for Cold
       War aerial surveillance
     * Document release could be just the beginning of Area 51
       information, expert says

   (CNN) -- Area 51 has long been a topic of fascination for conspiracy
   theorists and paranormal enthusiasts, but newly released CIA documents
   officially acknowledge the site and suggest that the area served a far
   less remarkable purpose than many had supposed.

   According to these reports, which include a map of the base's location
   in Nevada, Area 51 was merely a testing site for the government's U-2
   and OXCART aerial surveillance programs. The U-2 program conducted
   surveillance around the world, including over the Soviet Union during
   the Cold War.

   Area 51, about 125 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is synonymous in
   popular culture with government secrecy, and many have theorized that
   it holds the answer to one of the greatest questions plaguing mankind:
   Are we really alone in the universe?

   But the newly released documents make no mention of alien autopsy rooms
   or spaceship parking lots.

   This information will be disappointing to some, who have come to view
   the area as a mecca of sorts for alien encounters.

   For these true believers, the existence of alien spacecraft at Area 51,
   and the government's attempts to cover up their trace, is irrefutable
   and has been since reports of Unidentified Flying Objects -- or UFOs --
   began to emerge from the Nevada desert in the middle part of the 20th
   century.
   The map and other documents were released in response to a Freedom of
   Information Act request submitted by Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior
   fellow at the National Security Archives.

   fellow at the National Security Archives, in 2005.

   FBI memo details flying saucers, aliens
   UFO welcome center waits for green guys

   Richelson submitted the request as part of his continuing study of
   aerial surveillance programs and told CNN that he was not given an
   explanation of why the new documents were less redacted than previous
   versions declassified by the agency.

   He points out, however, that the location of Area 51 was not a
   particularly well-kept secret. Its location appears in books on aerial
   surveillance and is widely referenced in popular culture.

   In fact, the map that was released in the CIA documents mirrors the one
   that appears after a simple Google Maps search for "Area 51."

   Area 51 has also been referenced in government documents in the past,
   though this newest release is the first that acknowledges its existence
   and location in a purposeful way.

   Richelson told CNN he believes this could signal a dramatic change in
   the government's willingness to declassify information about the famed
   base, meaning even more information could come out about Area 51 in the
   future.

   The release of these reports seem to put the theories about aliens and
   flying saucers to rest for the time being, although they may not be
   enough to silence the true believers.

   At least they still have Roswell, right?
