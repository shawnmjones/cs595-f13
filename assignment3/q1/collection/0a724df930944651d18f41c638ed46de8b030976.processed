[24]Secretary Clinton maintains diplomatic composure in face of posturing by
McCain, Johnson and Paul

   If Republican senators on the Foreign Relations Committee thought they
   were going to cow Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at Wednesday
   morning's Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the Sept. 11 attack on
   the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, they got a surprise.

   After 20 minutes of obligatory introductory remarks and Clinton's
   reading of her [30]prepared remarks, the committee got down to er ...
   uh ... ahem ... business. Most of the questions were tepid or, like
   Sen. Marco Rubio's, indicative of someone having no grasp on the issue
   at hand. However, three senators who were determined to lower whatever
   respect anyone had left for them were successful in that endeavor.

   Sen. John McCain didn't really have any questions for Clinton. Just a
   ranting mini-speech. It's almost too bad Clinton takes being the
   nation's chief diplomat so seriously. It would have made for a
   wonderful moment to watch her turn Mr. Bitter into sputtering rage by
   ripping him a new excretory orifice. But that certainly wouldn't have
   been very diplomatic.

   The safety of U.S. representatives overseas should, indeed, be of
   paramount concern.  From that perspective, investigating what happened
   in Benghazi deserves attention. But it's being investigated, one report
   has already come out, and there have been 30 public and closed-door
   sessions on the subject in the past four months. The partisan antics of
   McCain, Lindsay Graham and others, who acted Wednesday like barkers at
   some carnival sideshow, have done nothing to make America's
   representatives abroad safer.

   Instead of raising blisters inside McCain's ears, however, Clinton
   quietly pointed out, among other things, that she and the senator have
   a difference of opinion about what happened and when in Benghazi as
   well as the nature of the subsequent U.S. response, including her own
   role in the matter. As for his complaints about the administration's
   supposed failure to train Libyans and provide them adequate assistance
   to deal with the many militias that sprang up in the chaotic aftermath
   of the overthrow of the Qadafi dictatorship, Clinton reminded McCain
   that it was not foot-dragging by the administration but rather by
   Congress that has delayed sending aid for those purposes to the North
   African nation.

   More below the fold, including Clinton's response to Republican Sen.
   Ron Johnson.

   Clinton did not remain quite as reserved at one point in the hearing,
   briefly flashing anger and pounding on the witness table when she
   responded to accusations by Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican.
   He declared that U.S. envoy to the United Nations Susan Rice had
   engaged in "purposely misleading the American public" about what had
   led up to the attacks in Libya:

   "Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that people were
   trying in real time to get to the best information," Clinton said.

     Clinton [31]told Johnson he was wrong and that he was missing the
     point with a narrow focus on the wording of the script Rice used.
     With four Americans dead, Clinton said angrily, "what difference at
     this point does it make?"

   And then there was Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who pretends he
   is a libertarian when it suits his purposes and something else when it
   doesn't. No doubt thinking of his stature among tea partiers if he
   actually seeks the presidency three years from now, he sent out a video
   of his questioning of Clinton during which he [32]said:

     "I'm glad that you're accepting responsibility. I think ultimately
     with your leaving that you accept the culpability for the worst
     tragedy since 9/11. And I really mean that. Had I been president and
     found you did not read the cables from Benghazi and from Ambassador
     Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post. I think it's
     inexcusable."

   Secretary Clinton had some help with that one. Democratic Sen. Chris
   Murphy of Connecticut fumed: "If some people on this committee want to
   call this tragedy the worst since 9/11, it misunderstands the nature of
   4,000 plus Americans lost in the War in Iraq under false pretenses."

   Not to mention the tens of thousands of Iraqis who were killed as a
   consequence of that concocted war. Who lost their jobs at the State
   Department or anywhere else over that?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       And I still don't understand how ANY state, let alone Wisconsin,
       elected a pedophile protector. Once upon a time, if you had a third
       cousin you never met who was a public defender assigned to defend a
       child molester, you would not have even been able to run for
       office.
       This guy actually insisted that the protection of the diocese was
       more important than the protection of children.
       Unbelievable.

   I'm keeping an open mind on Hillary Clinton in 2016.  When you look at
   the Afghanistan debates in 09 in the WH, she was more hawkish than
   Biden.  On the other hand, she may be a winner, and that matters for
   the supreme court and many other things.  We have plenty of time to
   decide.

   Today, she showed that the Republican boys were out of their league.

       the closest southern state for kennedy was a 2% margin, and even if

 We have three years for the truly ([965]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [966]Laurence Lewis, [967]mofembot, [968]worldlotus

   progressive options to become apparent. Kirsten Gillibrand has become
   an interesting possibility. She will have more experience in the senate
   than Obama did. Might be better as VP. She would be young enough to run
   for POTUS in '24 (58).

   I personally think Hillary becoming POTUS at 69 would almost be a death
   sentence. She's already come close to dying as SoS. The job is just too
   stressful at this point for someone older than 65. And I firmly believe
   that at this point the leader of the free world needs to have formed
   their worldview more recently than 60 years ago. It is a rare person
   who reaches 70 with the ability to envision the future without too much
   influence from the past.

   Especially given where we are headed in the climate catastrophe.
   Environmental issues have not been a strong enough point for Clinton.

   Age issue also applies to Joe, who is 70 now. Love the guy and think he
   is doing a great job for Obama and the US. Boomers need to cede the
   highest offices to younger generations. We can still contribute in
   other areas. I think we need to look at age limits in Congress and
   SCOTUS. I'd be ok with 80 there, prefer 70 or 75. It might just need to
   become a cultural pressure rather than law.

   There is research showing the best age to retire in order to have a
   healthy, moderate + quality of life from then on, is 62. While
   physically demanding jobs are clearly a problem after 60, so are high
   stress jobs. Stress is the ultimate cause of death, just varies what
   system was overcome by it.

   Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have clearly demonstrated how much an ex
   POTUS can accomplish internationally as well as nationally. They have a
   resume and experience that beats all others for knowing how the whole
   system works and contacts worldwide. And in some ways, more freedom to
   act. In thinking about what Obama will do in his second term, I have
   also been wondering what he will be doing from 55 on. Just to be clear,
   I think the rare people who do have excellent vision in their 70's and
   beyond, should certainly be in advisory capacities - just as they have
   been in human history. The vice president could be considered advisory.
   The length of time a VP would be POTUS is less than 4 years.

   The Bushes, OTOH, have -combined- not come close to either of the Dems.

       Yes, there are exceptions and I don't exclude that possibility.
       There is also overwhelming research that supports the negative
       effects of stress on health. Inevitably, the older we get, the more
       susceptible we are to stress. That especially includes higher
       cortex thinking. POTUS is a level of stress that is above the
       charts.
       McCain came across to a lot of voters as too old. I think Biden
       would definitely have a problem - many Dems probably will not

       They seem about the same to me, honestly. Obama was not a member of
       the US legislature when the Iraq war started, so we have nothing to
       compare there. Your speculations about who would be more willing to
       go into Iran are simply laughable, it's guesswork. What we do know
       is that Obama RAN on a platform of putting more troops into
       Afghanistan, and since being elected, he has done just that,
       quadrupling the number of troops in the country. Let us not forget
       that he has presided over the expansion of drone warfare, and
       engaging in military adventures in quite a few countries we are not
       even at war with.
       Obama is a hawk. Deal with it.

 Oh, I'm not saying he's a dove either ([1043]0+ / 0-)
       and I also know he didn't have to make the tough vote on Iraq.  I

       I do think that we're going to have make a choice between guns and

       That list proves, well, nothing. It isn't a proper comparison. It's

       Obama is in no way pro union. Ask Laura Clawson or any other pro
       union Kossack whether he has been good for unions. He hasn't, but
       we'll call this a tossup.
       Has Obama repealed NAFTA? No? Are more free trade agreements moving
       forward under Obama? Yes? Another tossup.
       You need to do more than mention two countries' names here. And I
       thought we were talking domestic issues?
       Again, simply saying "Domestic drug policy" without context means
       nothing. What policies? And, seriously, has Obama started allowing
       importation of lower cost drugs? Has he forced the government to
       negotiate with drug companies for lower prices? No?
       You really don't know how to argue very well. I mean, it feels as

   On S.759, a bill authored by Sen. Jim Webb (D-VA) which prohibited any
   attacks on Iran without explicit Congressional approval, there were
   three - count them, three - cosponsors.

   Guess who one [1069]was?

   Sen. Hillary Rodhan Clinton (D-NY).

   And guess who one wasn't?

   Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL).

   The bill was unquestionably designed to make it harder to charge into
   Iran without an extended debate, Clinton backed it and Obama did not -
   both were serving Senators at the time. Therefore, Clinton, ipso facto,
   is not going to be "more likely" to go into Iran than Obama would. It
   died in committee, but that's beside the point.

   but I have a different opinion on her so-called hawkishness.  I
   followed the run up to war in Iraq very closely and my opinion then and
   now was that she voted authorization not because she wanted to invade
   Iraq, but because she wanted time for the inspectors to do their jobs
   and W was getting impatient.  At that time it was expected that he
   would invade without authorization, Rice had already said that, months
   earlier. She never spoke in favor of invasion, only in favor of the
   inspectors, and since I knew that WMD were implausible, it's not hard
   for me to believe that she also knew the inspectors wouldn't find
   anything, and that it was taking so much time because proving a
   negative is much harder than proving the positive. Indeed the positive
   was never proved and the invasion proved the negative.

   Bill said, in asking for more time before the invasion, that if we
   invaded and it turned out there were no WMD, it wouldn't be possible to
   bring the dead back.

   Hillary has never defended herself other than to say that her mistake
   was in not realizing the power of W's obsession, she still thought it
   was possible to reason with him. But they still report she was in favor
   of that war. She has never said she favored it, unlike Edwards, who
   wrote that op ed in favor of invasion.

   Hillary talks tough, at least partly because she's a woman and she has
   to show that she can back up her words, more than a man would need to.
   The worst would have been that she was elected and then some scary
   world leader disbelieved her and did something she'd have to respond to
   with force, because she would but by that time it would have started.

   It's important for a president to be believed.

       but I too believe she was too smart to believe there were WMD in
       Iraq.  I mean if I could figure it out reading a few newspapers,
       she had to be able to figure it out with her connections to those
       who know stuff and all.   So that is why I fault her on the vote as
       much as I do.  She had a particular responsibility.  She was no
       babe in the woods bamboozled by Cheney.
       And I remember Wellstone's courage in voting against the war even
       though he was up for reelection in a tough race.
       I guess I figured Hillary's ambition came before her judgment.
       I admire her but she'd have to convince me that she would put
       wisdom over expediency.  She's older and perhaps wiser.  We'll see.

       I think that's why she does not defend herself, I think she thinks
       she should have known better, that she should have known W would
       invade anyway (although he did promise to let the inspectors
       complete the job if congress voted him authorization, he did end up
       breaking that promise he'd made), should have positioned herself to
       not get smeared by that war.
       But she didn't, she let herself take that risk (and I do believe
       she knew the risk) because she wanted to retain some influence
       (turned out she had none, her vote didn't give her what she hoped),
       over the timing, she worked behind the scenes to get the inspectors
       enough time and she failed.
       And then, when it was fait accompli, she backed up the president.
       Not by saying she agreed, she never said that, but by not standing
       against his decision.  I think she should have, that's where she
       and I would differ.  She should have thrown herself on the sword at
       that point, such was the reach of W's crime.
       If I knew it wasn't going to be a cake-walk, that we'd get stuck
       there, then she did too.  It's the crime of our century.  With any
       luck the last really bad one.

       ...Kerry spoke up in opposition AFTER the vote when Bush went ahead
       with invasion. There is plenty to critique in that speech, and it
       has been critiqued many times, but this is an important caveat:

     I want to underscore that this administration began this debate with
     a resolution that granted exceedingly broad authority to the
     President to use force. I regret that some in the Congress rushed so
     quickly to support it. I would have opposed it. It gave the
     President the authority to use force not only to enforce all of the
     U.N. resolutions as a cause of war, but also to produce regime
     change in Iraq, and to restore international peace and security in
     the Persian Gulf region. It made no mention of the President's
     efforts at the United Nations or the need to build multilateral
     support for whatever course of action we ultimately would take.

     I am pleased that our pressure, and the questions we have asked, and
     the criticisms that have been raised publicly, the debate in our
     democracy has pushed this administration to adopt important changes,
     both in language as well as in the promises that they make.
     The revised White House text, which we will vote on, limits the
     grant of authority to the President to the use of force only with
     respect to Iraq. It does not empower him to use force throughout the
     Persian Gulf region. It authorizes the President to use Armed Forces
     to defend the "national security'' of the United States--a power
     most of us believe he already has under the Constitution as
     Commander in Chief. And it empowers him to enforce all "relevant''
     Security Council resolutions related to Iraq. None of those
     resolutions or, for that matter, any of the other Security Council
     resolutions demanding Iraqi compliance with its international
     obligations, calls for a regime change. [...]
     When I vote to give the President of the United States the authority
     to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein, it is because
     I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in
     his hands is a threat, and a grave threat, to our security and that
     of our allies in the Persian Gulf region. I will vote yes because I
     believe it is the best way to hold Saddam Hussein accountable. And
     the administration, I believe, is now committed to a recognition
     that war must be the last option to address this threat, not the
     first, and that we must act in concert with allies around the globe
     to make the world's case against Saddam Hussein.
       Kerry gave too much away with his vote by trusting Bush. But Bush
       took more than Kerry gave.

       It is unfortunate that she used the term "conspiracy" because
       really it was simply a political strategy.
       One that was so obviously extreme and insane when it resulted in an
       impeachment of a President for getting a blow job from someone
       other than his wife - which was fairly standard operating procedure
       for many, many Congress Members on both sides of the aisle at the
       time - and which still isn't rare or uncommon today in DC.
       After all of that, nothing they do really surprises me.  I think
       what surprises me is that they keep getting away with this crazy
       shit.  I'm not surprised when criminals commit crimes.  I'm

   Sometimes - most times - I imagine diplomacy is the better idea.

   But sometimes......it's clearly an impediment to doing the most correct
   thing: [DEL: beating republicans unconscious :DEL] like legalizing a
   weed that doesn't actually kill anybody whilst we protect guns, which
   have dome worse things to children than marijuana actually has.

   Diplomacy allows this to continue.

   I am firmly convinced that a republicans are like they are because they
   know others have to behave in certain ways and those ways totally
   preclude doing anything about republicans' foul, anti-social and
   treasonous behaviors.

   They enjoy ZERO consequences for their insolence.

   because doing something about it is undiplomatic.

   I am proud to not be a diplomat.

   The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities
   of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
