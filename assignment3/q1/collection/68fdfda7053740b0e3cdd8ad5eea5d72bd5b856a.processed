[22]Rolling Stone cover featuring Boston bomber draws anger, controversy

   Too far?
   The latest issue of [29]Rolling Stone contains a deep look at how
   Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was turned towards terrorism.
   There's a problem, however: Because of the image of a seemingly
   "normal-looking" Tsarnaev on the cover, Walgreens, CVS and other chain
   stores [30]are refusing to carry it, [31]Fox News calls it
   "disgusting," saying that it "glamorizes" the bomber, and Boston Mayor
   Tom Menino says [32]in a letter to the publisher:

     Your August 3 cover rewards a terrorist with celebrity treatment. It
     is ill-conceived, at a best, and re-afferms a terrible message that
     destruction gains fame for killers and their "causes". [...]

     The survivors of the Boston attacks deserve Rolling Stone cover
     stories, though I no longer feel that Rolling Stone deserves them.

   I'm not sure that calling someone a "bomber," a "monster" and a member
   of "radical Islam" counts as glamorizing them. And American magazines
   have a history of putting terrible, terrible people on their covers;
   dictators, crooks and yes--murderers. Guess what: They don't all look
   like monsters. They don't all look like you think they will look. On
   the other hand, perhaps the wider societal value is in not granting
   notorious killers a celebrity status, even if unintentional. Is there a
   secondary effect on other potentially violent individuals?

   In response to the criticism, the magazine has updated the online
   version of the story with a note from the editors:

     Our hearts go out to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing, and
     our thoughts are always with them and their families. The cover
     story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of
     journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious
     and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural
     issues of our day. The fact that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is young, and in
     the same age group as many of our readers, makes it all the more
     important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain
     a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [49]Tagging tips - [50]Search For Tags - [51]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       it is flattering.  They also have no clue what Rolling Stone is.
       They have no clue that Matt Taibbi writes for them and has done
       some of the harshest expose' on the banks.   They think it is
       Entertainment Tonight in print.   The ignorance of the Americans is
       mind boggling.

       reading some of the completely ignorant reaction of #RollingStone
       tweets. The very word "Terrorist" has absolutely paralyzed way too
       many peoples'  brains. WAY too many.
       Mainstream American News--which Rolling Stone hasn't been for
       years--is a cesspool of stupid. If we don't fix that pretty soon,
       we're headed for even deeper shit than we're in now.

       Don't know the answer to this one and don't have time to look it
       up, but how many magazines was Bin Laden on the cover of? Methinks
       a lot.
       This is just Wingnuts trying to characterize Libruls (them and
       their damn rock-and-roll magazine) as "soft on terror." Nothing
       more, nothing less.
       Issue du jour.  This will blow over as soon as Kate Middleton has

       was on quite a few magazine covers in the US, and that didn't
       glamorize terrorism.  When OJ was on magazine covers, during his
       trial, nobody refused to put the mags on their shelves.  Fox didn't
       howl about it.  And the magazine covers certainly didn't glamorize
       murder.
       On the other hand, this kid on the cover of Rolling Stone does look
       like he could be some new "downer rock" phenom.

       for people who know nothing about the magazine, which I suspect so
       many people complaining don't. It's never been just about music.

     look like he could be some new "downer rock" phenom
       so could half of the population of this country that's under 20 ;)
       Hell, Rolling Stone ran a Charles Manson cover back in the day.
       Mind you, I was not as prone to paying attention to such minutiae
       as this, but I was still pretty up on current events even  then,
       and I don't remember a similar outbreak of outrage...

       It occurred to me immediately that because RS has been so real with
       their actual investigative journalism, that perhaps FOX got wind of

       their Poutrage machine...

   it's their magazine. Whether they had to or not is not up to any of us
   to judge.

   (warning--general rant ahead, not directed directly at the person I'm
   responding to):

   God forbid that anyone gain additional perspective on a difficult
   situation without their precious feelings taking precedence.  "They
   should have known better...' Says who?

   Don't say it for everyone else. Say it to yourself. Be mad. Don't buy
   this magazine. Don't read this magazine. Don't. Ever. Fucking. Talk.
   About. This. Magazine. EVER. AGAIN. Nope. If you're that pissed off
   about this picture--that's run on the cover of other publications, and
   recently--you are done with Rolling Stone. For Good.

   So never, ever let me catch you "digging one of their future stories",
   next time they do one you agree with and/or admire. And they will, if
   you hang around here long enough.

   The hysterical, self-righteousness uproar about This Cover is so
   unbelievably, jaw-droppingly stupid. Magazines have been putting
   terrorists on their cover for decades now. Why the fuck is this cover
   different?

   I'll tell you why...because this jumoke could be your next door
   neighbor and you're too chickenshit to deal with it because YOU would
   have to start examining some real unpleasant truths about your country.

   As one of those who object, it is because making the cover of Rolling
   Stone is how a musician knows they are finally getting into the big
   time. For them, it is a reward for a lot of hard work. I do not think
   accused mass-murderers should get that sort of attention. I appreciate
   that Rolling Stone has a long tradition of also doing serious news
   well, including covering stories the mainstream news magazines often
   ignore. If they want to talk about the killer, how about putting the
   picture of one of his victims who will never walk again on the cover?

   charge is utterly warranted.
   It's just silly to try to deny that Tsarnaev's cover-shot is
   glamorizing; it makes him look like the young Donovan (if you're under
   40, Google and Spotify him; pretty tunage) as shot by Annie Leibowitz.
   And since the story of some teen and tween girls having sympathy for
   Tsarnaev is well known, this was an unforced error by RS, and an
   egregiously stupid one.

   The yellow overlay, the rendition into sharp two-color, all of that

   that.

   Did they do that with the Tsarnaev cover?

   Do they show Manson wearing, well, something you'd expect to see a pop
   star wearing on the cover of Rolling Stone?

   You know, the subject didn't look like a drooling psychopath in his
   blacks and backwards baseball cap, either. He looked quite ordinary,
   but they didn't choose that picture. Nor did they choose a picture of
   him as an eight-year-old.

   This is journalism - photographic and print.  People should not only
   give Rolling Stone more credit - they should give themselves more
   credit.  The idea of boycotting because the cover story is about a kid
   who looked and acted boy-next-door but was capable of monstrosity is
   absurdly childish.  And if we refuse to look that premise in the eye,
   we risk losing the ability to draw any lessons at all.  The call to
   boycott a complexly uncomfortable (and based on author Reitman's
   record, probably exhaustively researched) story, is a dangerously
   temperamental and self-indulgent response.

       challenges you. I think your reaction is appropriate and probably
       mirrors the situation. You don't see evil when you look at this
       kid, not initially. Nobody suspected evil from this kid and his
       brother.

   To be a monster in childish America.  That's really the whole
   controversy.  The kid looks young and cute, and you wouldn't mind your
   daughter dating him.  But in America that kind of ambiguity can't be
   tolerated.  Plus it's a great opportunity to slap at the liberal,
   stoner Rolling Stone for being unfeeling and anti American.  They
   should at least have drawn on some horns and fangs :/

   A yearbook picture, a childhood photo, a snapshot of him out with his

   less of a sense that they're portraying him as a tragic figure that
   people should feel sorry for.  I haven't read the article, so I don't
   know if that is the thrust of the piece, but the cover suggests it.
   That's going to bother a lot of people.  I mean, it's up to them.  I
   think they want the publicity and magazine sales, so that's probably
   what drove the decision.  I don't personally feel bothered by it, but I
   think it's understandable why many folks find it in poor taste.

       negative reactions as much as the sheer outrage of all the armchair
       quarterbacks who probably haven't read Rolling Stone in the last 20
       years, if at all.
        I wouldn't fault victims families for being pissed, either--for
       them I am sure it's too soon. But then again, how pissed at the
       "magazines" and "newspapers" were New Yorkers after 9/11?
       Seriously, Osama Bin Laden was on how many covers of how many
       magazines? You couldn't get away from that shit for quite sometime,
       as I recall.
       So why is this attack different than that attack? Because it was in
       Boston? Because it was "an outside event"? What? I don't get it.
       Why are we even excoriating the photo itself? It wasn't shot
       exclusively for Rolling Stone, it has been in circulation for a few
       months now and has also been attributed to the NYT front page.
       WTF? That's what I'm faulting. This hysteria!  There's something
       really weird about all this. The Twitters scaled epic proportions
       of self-righteous indignation this afternoon. I've never seen so
       many different ways to say "You people suck". People are pissed,
       but I honestly think it's simply because a lot of them just don't
       want to know about that this punk could have had a life in their
       neighborhood and they wouldn't know it unless somebody they loved
       died. A lot of folks just don't want to think about it.

   And it wasn't just a "choice" of the photo - it's been worked over to
   achieve the glamor shot effect.

   It's a cheap trick to get publicity. And it worked.

   The text referring to him negatively is designed to get lost in the

 "The Bomber" is not a negative ([1190]0+ / 0-)
       It's a name that can be easily glamorized or turned into a

       How well do you think this choice of photo is furthering that
       reflection, based on the reaction you're seeing?
       I agree, a photo that did that would have been great - for example,
       a picture of him as an eight-year-old.

       had a good [1619]point about the photo:

     And if Rolling Stone did pick the photo in part to appeal to the
     fans, well, according to The Atlantic's Bennett, they're not
     pleased:

     Ironically, even the small community of "Free Dzhokhar" zealots, who
     are unabashed fans of Tsarnaev (and his looks) are against the cover
     too, believing the story and the use of the word "monster" in the
     headline will unfairly prejudice people against him.

     Um, no, that's not ironic -- those fans may be ignorant with regard
     to Tsarnaev, but at least they can read a twenty-word cover line. It
     promises an article that holds Tsarnaev responsible for a brutal
     crime -- as it should. That upsets them. It should satisfy us.

       As you say, running the same photo on the cover of Time would have
       gotten a completely different reaction.
       Rolling Stone frequently runs glamour shots of celebrities
       promoting themselves. As a Rolling Stone cover, that photo looks
       like a glamour shot of a celebrity. I'm not saying such photos are
       all of RS's covers, but they run a lot of covers that are similar
       to this photo, and when they do, that's what they're doing. Except
       this time. I can see why people are confused.

       If not the song itself, the spirit behind the song: The implication
       is that the cover of Rolling Stone is an exalted position to be in.
       It's considered a de facto seal of approval. (Yes, I know they also
       had Charles Manson on the cover, but that's not the way most people
       think of the mag.)
       I'm not terribly upset by it, but I can see why some folks are, and

   I was hoping someone would dig those up. If Tsarnaev did not happen to
   be good-looking this would not even be an issue. I think that people

       that to most people that image looks scary because he looks
       different from us and matches their pre-conceived notion of what an
       evildoer terrorist looks like. As opposed to this guy who looks
       like he could on your teenagers baseball team. Part of it also is
       peoples idea of what Rolling Stone is, most are unaware that they
       do serious journalism over there, so they hold it to different

       Manson, McVeigh, Bin Laden, OJ, etc. have all gotten their own
       covers.  The problem with the cover, apparently, is that he is too
       good looking.  Not really scary.  Too normal.  The guy next door.
       Maybe if he was old and ugly he wouldn't be on Rolling Stone.  But
       he'd be somewhere.  There is no doubt about that.

   It's interesting to me that the exact same photo appeared on the front
   page of the New York Times a few months ago, but no one complained. I'm
   personally mixed on whether the photos of such individuals should even
   be released at all in the first place, but this one has already been
   so--so that argument holds no weight. And, in this case, it shows that
   he wasn't some deformed monster living in an underground lair but a
   formerly normal person who had become radicalized. And that makes you
   think more and reduces the default tendency to "other." Moreover,
   magazines have featured individuals responsible for the deaths of far
   more people--and in more unambiguously positive lights. Take, for
   example, George W. Bush.

   There are a few problems I have.

   1. I've seen pictures of him before. He's not physically ugly. But I've
   also seen the way the magazine industry messes around with pictures of
   people. What upsets me, as simple as it might seem, is the lighting.
   They deliberately set the soft lighting of that picture to make it look
   like it was taken of a rock star in the 1970s.

   2. This is not just on the Rolling Stones, per se, but I feel I must
   point out that the difference in the way we portray white male killers
   and men of color on the covers of magazines in this country is messed
   up. As Mona Eltahawy pointed out on Twitter, the way Time Magazine
   portrayed innocent Egyptians protesting as vicious animals was way more
   offensive than this picture. When was the last time a killer who was
   nonwhite was made to look like this on the covers of magazines?

   I guess, in the end, my problem is that we only seem to want to
   humanize white killers.

       And I am even stronger in my belief that it was altered. Look at

       much less bright and his right arm has a normal skin tone. The
       overall picture is much brighter, too.

       But they are RS magazine. They could not have been blind to the
       fact that this particular picture more than any other, especially
       with the contrast changes in light they made, made him look exactly
       like the rock stars they used to put on the cover of their
       magazines in the 1970s. You can make the argument that even rock
       stars can be killers, and I do not dispute that. However, what I do
       dispute is that he looks like a rock star in every picture
       available of him. They chose this one on purpose.
       By choosing that particular picture to put on the cover, they are
       making him look like a rock star. I've been reading RS for decades.
       I know that they have done some fantastic journalism, and I am
       pretty sure that they printed a good article with this photo, but
       years from now, when people have forgotten the article, they will
       remember this photo.
       And it is just another in a long line of magazines that fetishize
       white killers.

       I just haven't seen a bad picture of the boy. I've looked. Well

       boston bomber and his name - I have yet to see one picture of him
       that doesn't look (i'll say it) sexy. He's a good looking kid.
       I think it brings up some really interesting things though in a lot
       of areas, including race like you mentioned in your original

   On one hand, it seems wrong that he gets the cover and the added
   attention. I understand that point of view.

   However, if the point is to show how someone can go from being a
   perfectly normal kid with a bright future ahead of him to "Become a
   Monster" (quoting the caption on the cover) then I think the picture
   fits the story. It shows that he was a normal teenager. The kind of guy
   you see on the street every day and don't think twice about. It's
   troubling to think of it that way but that's the whole point, right?

       Rolling Stone did an excellent story on the Columbine shooting.
       However, it was mostly focused on Harris and Klebold and how they
       became mass murderers. The type of people who are interested in
       reading crime stories, and there are many such people out there,
       are generally interested in reading about the perpetrators and not
       the victims who, after all, were just minding their own business
       when they were killed.

   on in college inflames feelings of desire, disgust, confusion and

       Rolling Stone hit the communications sweet spot.
       It frightens people that they find him attractive and rather than
       process that, read the article and have a dialogue about how scary
       it is that we can have people like this in our midst without
       realizing it. And how tragic it is that we can't tell when someone
       is heading this way, people just want to get mad at the magazine

   Should they give him horns and a tail, color his skin red, and paint

   beneath?

   Would that artistic license satisfy the delicate sensibilities of those
   who are so so so sooooooooo offended by this Rolling Stone cover? Would
   that level of demonization be sufficient?

   Are we really so superficial, so fixated on external appearances, that
   we cannot deal with the fact that a good-looking, normal-seeming young

       good for him, IMHO. Run pics in the article, or run a montage of

       This is a ploy to get eyeballs and sales. By exploiting tragedy. I
       never really forgave the Stones for using the killings at Altamont
       in their movie and make money off of it, either.
       Having been terribly close to the center of media frenzy involving
       some very tragic circumstances, I can't begin to tell you how much
       I hated seeing journalists and their parent organizations
       sensationalizing horror and tragedy to make money. It's a grim and

   So yeah, one definitely is not like the others.

   Look, I subscribe to RS for the music news and reviews. The national
   affairs stuff I skim through with a few exceptions here and there. I
   think the article accompanying the cover will be interesting but it's
   pretty clear the cover was meant to provoke. All reactions are valid,
   but I am troubled by corporate retail essentially banning it.

   The main reason to object to RS, in general, is it's too conservative
   in terms of music. I mean there is no reason to ever put the Rolling
   Stones on the cover ever again. Meanwhile, there are some great new
   artists who I would love to see get more attention.

       They intended to run a picture that made him look ordinary, but
       they ended up making him look like the latest pop star Rolling
       Stone wants you to pay attention to.
       Part of this was the photo selection - I don't think Rolling Stone
       really gets "ordinary" - and part of it is the cultural
       significance that the Rolling Stone cover carries. When you see a
       picture that looks like that on Rolling Stone's cover, that's
       almost always what they're doing.
       I can completely understand how people failed to pick up on that
       intended message.

       He wasn't just an ordinary kid. People adored him. One of the
       things that defined him was that everyone thought he was so cute.
       It comes up again and again when people interview those who knew
       him.
       The photo on the cover was one of his FB profile photos. This is
       the kid all his friends, family, teachers, coaches knew. He had a
       sort of rock star quality to him.
       And now, they're all struggling to come to terms with how that kid
       they adored and found so very attractive ended up doing something
       so monstrous.
       It seems to me that it gets under people's skins because the first
       reaction to the photo is "sexy boy" and then it hits you who it is.
       That it's frightening to realize that you just never know if that
       person you find attractive is capable of sociopathic behavior.
       A dear friend of mine grew up next door to boy, whose sister was
       her best friend. She spent many many days of her childhood in their
       house. In our 30s, we learned that he was a serial murderer. My
       friend was absolutely devastated. It rocked her sense of safety.
       How could she have been around him all those years, so close to his
       family, and not know? It's the most frightening prospect of all.
       Far more frightening than the menacing looking person. It makes us
       question our ability judge who we're with and whether we're safe.

 The rock star element garbles the message. ([2591]1+ / 0-)

       I don't think people are having that intended "that person you find
       attractive is capable of sociopathic behavior" reaction. Notice
       that the complaint is about fame and glamour, not that the cover is
       too sympathetic.
       In your comment, you talk about a boy next door to your friend, an
       someone who is a friend, student, or family member. That's not the
       same thing as a rock star.
       A celebrity/cover model/rock star type isn't someone you know. Such
       a figure is a distant figure, a figure that nobody would have the
       slightest difficulty believing was a sociopath. If you found out
       that the bassist of some band turned out to be a serial murderer,
       that's not that frightening prospect you mention. It's some guy you
       see on TV, or on the cover of Rolling Stone.
       The rock star element to the photo intrudes into the point they're
       trying to make, that they make in the text, about someone who is
       like us going wrong. The photo doesn't make him look like us, but
       like some celebrity - at least, when it's put on the cover of
       Rolling Stone it does.
       They should have picked a more ordinary photo, to make the point
       you describe.

       are disturbed by their initial response to the photo. They deflect
       that by complaining that it is glamorizing him.
       I think the "rock star" feeling of it is exactly what we need to
       process. This wasn't just a boy next door, he was someone his
       friends experienced as particularly cute and a good athlete. In
       their circle he had a rock star quality to them. And that very
       aspect of him may be why no one noticed what he was going through.
       How did all those people around him miss that he was a teenager
       whose parents abandoned him and left the country? How did they not
       notice the increasingly radical fundamental nature of his older
       brother's influence? If you read the article, some of his Chechnyan
       friends speak to the fact that in their culture older brothers have
       a god-like authoritarian status. They didn't worry that this older
       god-brother was driving an abandoned younger brother somewhere
       dark?
       Could it be that they were charmed into complacency about him
       because of his "rock star" qualities?

       You can stop telling me that my reaction isn't really my reaction
       any time you want, Dr. Freud.
       To get back to the actual point, it doesn't matter if he came
       across as particularly charismatic to people he knew. Individuals
       have a lot of traits others notice; that doesn't make each and
       every trait of Tsarnaev's relevant, or useful, to what this cover
       was about. Making him look like a rock star causes those of us who
       didn't know him, and who only saw him on TV, feel less of that "boy
       next door" sense that's the essence of what the cover was trying to
       portray.
       The role that his particular charisma might have played in the
       reactions of people around him is an interesting topic to write
       about, but it doesn't translate that way in the photo, which is
       seen by people who haven't read the article, but who have seen

   'Vogue'.

   By virtue of being on the cover, you are granted all the expertise of
   the best photo/image editors, get a stylistic appeal that goes above
   and beyond the original image, and by virtue of that gain instant
   celebrity status.

   I agree with those who say that the image DOES glorify him it depicts
   him as a rock star--the terms 'terrorist' 'monster' 'bomber'
   notwithstanding.  The picture is what you see--not the words.  And the
   magazine editors know this.

   The original pictures of him are hardly that glamorous.

   The examples people cite here, Hitler, Bin Laden, Mc Veigh, etc.
   etc....all of these images show normal looking people.  As they might
   appear in the news (not in mugshots, not in high-style publications)

   This example elevates the portrayal to rock-star status by design.
   Anyone pretending not to see that is choosing not to see it.

   That said, of course the RS can put whatever it wants on its cover.
   But I'm not surprised a bunch of people are pissed about it--(and
   hardly just right wingers).

       If the story is that a seemingly normal, well-adjusted college kid

       so it's understandable that the media would cater to that, for

       takes away from the underlying evil that he committed. It almost

   This is an interesting cultural/literary phenomenon. The history of

   minds, additional meaning (glamorous celebrity we're promoting) that it
   wouldn't if it appeared on some other magazine's cover.

       I just think it works.  It's a cover that creates a sharp contrast,
       between the friendly, handsome kid who looks like he belongs on the
       cover of Rolling Stone, and the monster we know him to be - the
       headline makes that clear if there was any doubt left.
       The cover is trying to make us feel that tension.  The article is
       about that tension.  It's an unsettling tension that's still
       vitally important to the event.

     It's a cover that creates a sharp contrast, between the friendly,

       The tension they intend to convey is between an ordinary, nice,
       appealing person and monster. Not between a glamorous celebrity who
       belongs on the cover of Rolling Stone and a murderer.
       And yet, because it's Rolling Stone, that photo looks like, as you
       say, someone who belongs on a Rolling Stone cover. This idea of a
       glamorous celebrity, which has nothing to do with their actual
       meaning or the article, intrudes into their point, and obscures it.
       A picture of him looking a bit goofy, or a picture of him when he
       was eight years old, would have worked much better for that
       contrast.

       I think it's more than being ordinary - the contrast is highlighted

   so yes, these covers do have a different meaning for many people than

 It is so insincere to use such clichés as ([2934]0+ / 0-)

   "our hearts go out" and "our prayers are with..."

   Anybody saying such trite trash will find me leaving their audience. It
   sounds so poignant... if you are braindead and incapable of expressing
   true emotion.

   As worthless as "no problem" and "no-brainer."

   I can't believe that a writer, a spokesperson, or a public speaker can
   use such trivial hogwash and get paid for it. Phonies!

   As for the bomber being glorified, it is wrong. But Rolling Stone can
   be wrong all they want if they profit from it. That is their priority,
   and they cannot pretend otherwise with their lame excuse that their
   young audience needs their complex examination. Laughing. They are
   selling shock value. I do not question their motive or perceive it as
   anything but.

   Honesty is not a policy. It's a character trait.

   the picture.  It's more than the image, it's the why.  How did this

   That is the question I think the Rolling Stone is asking.

   I can't say they were wrong to put this image on the cover any more
   than I can say they were wrong to ask the quesrtion.

   The only way to do that is to take a look at the lives they led before

   Nothing wrong with making that information PUBLIC. In fact knowledge is
   good.

   Oh noes they put a normal photo of the guy on the cover.

   Maybe because he looks normal?

   Perhaps this flies in the face of the paranoids in the world who see
   everything black and white. It messes with their perception of how they
   think things are. Thus the outrage. Oh noes he's not lookin' like an

   because I am a reasonable, rational person who is

 Is the pot calling the kettle black? ([2962]0+ / 0-)

       Being sensitive the image I draw of Dzhokhar was the image taken
   when he was rounding a corner, just after the murders. It's when his
   soul has left & like what a huge amount of killers, Bush, Chainy a lot
   of repukes, koch brothers, on down the line, look, soulless & they
   think they're getting away with it.
       Even this blog violates my senses. Huge pictures of Chainy, his
   teeth and the likes of. I actually have some Buddhist Bodhisattva long
   prints I sometimes use to screen out while I read.
       My theory is everyone, everyone is so hopped up on viagra & it's
   permeation that simple normal conversation is warped to start with.
   Throw in drug combo's, radiation brain degeneration and it's become
   complex to talk simple constructs. Things like: NSA = You own it if you
   accept it & don't stop it. No, secret fracking chemicals are poison.
   I'll be God damned if I'm going to let you own it. Whatever.
       The sad part is those are the images that are shoved down our
   throats continually especially when the NEWS climaxes. At this time,
   before this cover because of Trayvon, I kept remembering the 8 year old
   boy, Martin Richard with the poster, "No More Hurting People, PEACE."
   Not relevant right now but to me in my construct of what reality is, it
   is. What do you tell the children?
       Want to create a VERY COOL APP? One that you could left click (I
   have an Imac), over an image, and replace it with one of your choosing.
   I'm sick of looking at Chainys' TEETH
       I just want to emphasize, in all the blogs, newspaper, tweets &
   twirls, after the Trayvon verdict, "Where was Martin Richard?"
       I do Thank Hunter for keeping this image small.

 Addendum ([2969]0+ / 0-)
           Maybe you could add an x close box to the photo. Maybe it could
       turn into a page with organizations related to the article. Maybe
       it could showcase DKOS members photos that change every few
       minutes. Maybe it could showcase DKOS members market products. No
       animation except there may be a button for an animation that
       trashed the image. Maybe it could just be a stationary regular
       product ad that disappeared after a few minutes with then the above
       mentioned. ANYTHING BUT TO HAVE TO SCROLL DOWN LOOKING AT ARTICLE

 They should have used a different picture. ([2987]0+ / 0-)

   This photo makes him look like a rock star, and the teaser for the
   story suggests a tragic tale of a fall from grace.  That combo is going
   to rub a lot of people the wrong way.  If they had used a mug shot, a
   picture of him in court, etc. It would have gone over better.  I think
   they made an error in judgment here.

   Personally, I really don't care, but then I don't live in Boston and
   the bombing didn't directly affect me or anyone I know.  I think I'd
   have a much stronger reaction if my proximity to this event were more
   personal.
