   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   During the first half of 2013, the 113th Congress was [29]even less
   productive than the non-productive 112th Congress before it. In a mad
   dash to throw some new laws onto the floor before they adjourn for
   their August recess (how very French of them), Speaker Boehner has been
   busy scribbling new bills on his cocktail napkin at the gentlemen's
   club...

     LOVELY BUNCH OF COCONUTS ESTABLISHMENT ACT
     (1) A "LOVELY BUNCH" shall consist of (a) no less than three, and
     (b) no more than seven coconuts. (2) Penalty for violation is a
     maximum of (a) Three years in federal prison, (b) a $10,000 fine,
     and/or (c) rendition.
     -
     THE LONELIEST NUMBER
     (1) One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do. (2) In certain
     situations two can be as bad as one because (2a) it's the loneliest
     number since the number one.

   The United States Capitol dome. "Next on the House agenda:
   Armpit farts! Armpit farts!!!"
   -

     PLAN DISCOVERY ACT OF 2013
     (1) Ask where the president's plan is. (2) Repeat. (3) If asked
     where the Republican plan is, see (1) and (2).
     -
     HONEY, WHILE YOU'RE AT THE STORE DECLARATION
     (1) We need (a) Milk, with (a1) not more than two percent milkfat
     and (a2) not less than 5 days remaining before the expiration date,
     (b) Eggs, (c) Twinkies, (d) All-Bran, without (d1) raisins, but with
     (d2) extra fiber, (e) Chicken, without (e1) the skin, and (e2) the
     bones, (f) Chiclets. (2) The penalty for forgetting any of these
     items will be (2a) a dirty look from the wife, and (2b) nooky
     cessation for two weeks.
     -

     large enough to not fit into any vehicle except the bed of a pickup
     truck, (b) come with a minimum of 89 loose parts, including (b1) a
     minimum of three missing parts that are considered (b1a) critical to
     the structural integrity of the piece, and (b2) a minimum of eight
     parts that belong to an entirely different model altogether.
     -
     GLORIOUS LEADER IDENTIFICATION ACT
     (1) All future Americans, regardless of gender, shall henceforth be
     named "Ronald Reagan." (2) Each individual shall be allowed to
     choose their own middle name with the understanding that (2a) they
     must use Ronald as their primary name. (3) This law shall apply
     retroactively to all current living American citizens. (4) A Name
     Czar will be appointed to enforce this Act. (5) Current Name Czar
     candidates include Ronald Bubba Reagan, Ronald Janet Reagan, Ronald
     Reagan Reagan and Ronald Ronald Reagan.
     -
     AVIARY CONUNDRUM ACT
     (1) The egg came first. (2) And that's final or you're a commie.

   Aren't we lucky he wields the gavel.

   Your Thursday Molly Ivins Moment:
   Molly ivins publicity photo &nbsp;--- small

     So, now all we know about John Roberts is that he has nice manners
     and is being managed by a bunch of morons ---and he's willing to say
     what they spin for him. Then we start getting the record. He's
     defended the often violent Operation Rescue. He went to Florida to
     advise Jeb Bush during the 2000 election recount. Other Federalists,
     Timothy Flanigan (who's now in confirmation hearings for deputy
     attorney general) and Ted Olson (who became solicitor general of the
     United States) signed onto the brief to convince the Supremes to
     stop the count in Florida and install Bush. It's all classic,
     right-wing judicial activism---the very "activism" they complain
     bitterly about if it doesn't fit their radical agenda.

   Puppy Pic of the Day:  Fred Astaire, [33]eat yer heart out...

   -
   Martin Luther King Jr. deliveres his I Have A Dream speech on August
   28, 1963.
   Later this month: the 50th
   anniversary of MLK's little
   tailgate party in Washington.
   CHEERS to August.  The dog days.  The month everybody should be allowed
   to take off for vacation. (Right, France?)  The month everyone wears
   the shit out of their whites because they know Labor Day's just around
   the corner.  Same-sex marriages start today in Minnesota and Rhode
   Island (see next item, below).  [34]Lollapalooza starts tomorrow in
   Chicago, and the 13th is the high Republican holiday known as "Blame
   Someone Else Day."  The next 31 days include National Raspberry Cream
   Pie Day, Watermelon Day, Ice Cream Sandwich Day, Mustard Day, Potatoe
   (I prefer the Dan Quayle spelling) Day, Cherry Popsicle Day and Trail
   Mix Day, to be followed on September 1st with "Honey, Where Did We Put
   The Treadmill?" Day.  Loni Anderson and I (but, sadly, not Neil
   Armstrong this year, except in spirit) blow out our birthday candles on
   the 5th, a day after Barack Obama turns 52.  Of course, it's also the
   time of year in which you [35]never, ever want to introduce a bogus war
   based on shitty intelligence to the public.  P.S. Hot enough for ya?

   CHEERS to morning mazel tovs.  Another milestone for the LGBT history
   books as the first same-sex marriage ceremonies were performed at the
   stroke of midnight in [36]Minnesota and, later today, [37]Rhode Island.
    The dominoes are falling so fast I can't keep count these days, but I
   think they're states #13 and #14 to openly defy God's Word and bring
   upon them a... (Please pick one in the state of your choice):
   Willy Wonka with gay marriage caption.

     Minnesota
     Swarm of Michele Bachmanns
     Rainstorm of wild rice soup
     Pox on their 10,000 lakes
     Thousand-year curse on their International polka festival

     Rhode Island
     Swarm of Elisabeth Hasselbecks
     Rainstorm of hot wieners
     Pox on their Narragansett Bay
     Thousand-year curse on their Newport jazz festival

   The fun and sentimentality of watching the events in a state on Day 1
   of their marriage equality law taking effect will never---ever---get
   old.  I'll be dabbing my eyes all day, I expect.  So before I get all
   blubbery I'll just say two words: "Congratulations!" and "Prenup!"

   CHEERS to the word of the day: Comeuppance.  That's what hit House
   Republicans like a frying pan to the face yesterday when they tried to
   pass a Paul Ryan-approved Transportation and HUD budget bill and
   [38]had to toss it in the trash because it didn't have the votes---not
   even from a majority of austerity-humping Republicans.  This is the key
   take-away message:

     "With this action, the House has declined to proceed on the
     implementation of the very budget it adopted three months ago,"
     said...Republican [House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal
     Rogers].  "Thus I believe that the House has made its choice:
     sequestration---and its unrealistic and ill-conceived discretionary
     cuts---must be brought to an end."

   Or, to put it in language the tea party types will understand: Get a
   brain, morans.

   OH, BOO HOO to Officer Overkill.  Remember that UC Davis security
   goon---Lt. John Pike---who calmly walked back and forth as he doused
   pepper spray on those protesters at point-blank range a year-and-a-half
   ago?  Here' I'll refresh your memory:
   Lt. John Pike sprays UC Davis Occupy protesters with pepper spray,
   Yeah.  That asshole.  He wants worker's comp because the public
   backlash to his treatment of those kids [39]hurt his fee-fees.  In
   fact, sometimes the criticism brings tears to his eyes.  Well ain't
   karma a bitch.

   JEERS to words unheeded.  Remember when Alan Greenspan was treated as
   an almighty sage, the Yoda of the financial universe, the Gollum of the
   Galts?  As long as he was saying what Republicans wanted to hear, he
   was good as gold.  But three years ago today, in a brief moment of
   clarity at the height of the tea party's influence, he [40]tossed his
   GOP overlords an anchor:

     MR. GREENSPAN: Look, I'm very much in favor of tax cuts, but not
     with borrowed money. And the problem that we've gotten into in
     recent years is spending programs with borrowed money, tax cuts with
     borrowed money, and at the end of the day, that proves disastrous.
     And my view is I don't think we can play subtle policy here on it.
     MR. GREGORY: You don't agree with Republican leaders who say tax
     cuts pay for themselves?
     MR. GREENSPAN: They do not.

   Did Republicans take his advice and offer the thanks of a grateful
   nation?  Hardly.  They took him out behind the woodshed, made him
   squeal like a you-know what and, unless I missed something, he's been a
   good little Greenspan ever since.  And the beltway party invitations
   overfloweth once again.

   Five years ago in C&J: August 1, 2008

   JEERS to living too close to the sun.  Man, is it hot or what??!!
   Blazing hot!  And humid...yeesh!  Just awful.  Of course I'm talking
   about the weather forecast for Baghdad: 116°, 114°, 113°, 113°...etc.
   And amazingly, our troops still have the wherewithal to smile about it:
   Iraq soldier standing next to hot thermometer in Iraq
   Now...what were you saying about the weather here, Shortsy McTanktop?

   -

   And just one more...

   JEERS to the cellar dweller.  This is Day 10 of C&J's Anthony Weiner
   information blackout...and Day 4 of our MSNBC boycott, which will last
   until they stop obsessing over the self-immolation of the least popular
   candidate in the NYC mayor's race.  Because the circus is getting so
   ridiculous, we're moving the whole damn thing down here in the
   basement.  Our pledge to post singing dogs or craaaazy cats until
   whatsizface is officially out of the race remains in force:
   Cat on tractor
   In tomorrow's update, a dachshund sings Wagner.  Because, my god, what
   else would it sing?

   Have a nice Thursday.  Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering
   about today?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [55]Tagging tips - [56]Search For Tags - [57]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Cheers to lighting equipment being delivered today.  At least
       that's what Guitar Center said yesterday.  Now let's hope it all
       works upon delivery.
       Jeers that this means my planned figure purchase (medieval
       longbowmen and crossbowmen) is put on hold because of the lighting
       expenditures.  Oh well, I've got dwarves to paint.
       Cheers to the project management stuff I'm doing at work.  This is
       all part of the "increased responsibilities" we feds in the field
       offices have been given as part of our recent promotion.  I'm
       managing the deployment and upgrade of file servers in 19 field
       offices and this year's "refresh" operation where we partially
       replace geezy old desktops and laptops in all our field offices.
       It's a far cry from the last decade when the Bushies tried to
       outsource us.  It only took six years for the fed managers who
       thrived under the Bushies to finally be gone and thus, we have a
       different breed of managers, a far better breed of managers.  We
       all understandable cursed the Worst. President. Ever. on a variety
       of levels but I cursed the bastard every day I came into work for
       the better part of 8 years since I had a grounds-eye view of how he
       and his cronies were working hard to trash the federal gubmint.
       Cheers to a good meeting yesterday of us field fed IT people and
       our supervisor in HQ.  We're coordinating better and sharing ideas
       more and it's translating, we hope, into better service for our
       [DEL: idiots :DEL] , er, users.  :)

       I go to bed. I stayed up too late the other night, got up at 6 and
       decided to go back to bed. BIG MISTAKE. I was more tired when I
       finally got up than I would have been if I had just stayed up.

       My train is at 6:24.  5-5:30 is kitten time, 5:30-6 is
       shower/clothing/breakfast time, 6-6:20 if walk time.
       On Saturday mornings, I tend to get up around 6, so I can go to a

       I do nap in the afternoons a few times a week, which helps.

       45 minutes on the chez longue out on our sun porch, which gets a

 Anthony Weiner's role model ([363]23+ / 0-)

   Apparently there is no sign of Carlos Danger on the front pages of the
   New York tabloids today. Anthony Weiner must be walking around saying
   "That Simon Cowl is okay in my book" but who could have inspired him to
   run for mayor?

   Don't be checking [387]his Congressional record because they just make
   shit up but this Daniel E. Sickles made Weiner seem like an alter boy.
   The lead in [388]Today in New York, they went to the New York Public
   Library for the straight dope.

     They pointed to an even more shocking scandal, the case of
     Representative Daniel E. Sickles of New York.

     Sickles began serving in Congress in 1857. Two years later, he shot
     and killed his wife's lover, Philip Barton Key II, opposite from the
     White House. (Key was the son of Francis Scott Key, who wrote the
     lyrics to "The Star-Spangled Banner.")

     Sickles was jailed only briefly. He was acquitted of murder - by
     some accounts, after a defense of temporary insanity.

     After finishing his term in Congress, he had a notorious tenure as a
     Union general in the Civil War.

     At the Battle of Gettysburg, he disobeyed orders and many of his men
     were killed.

     Let's omit, for brevity's sake, his many dalliances with prostitutes
     over the years.

     Still, the public apparently forgave his trespasses: in the 1890s,
     he was elected to Congress again.

   See now that is a sign of progress. Daniel E. Sickles could never get
   back into the good graces of the present day New York voters. The New
   York media is too punny for that.

       Sickles, always in need of some reason, no matter how obscure, to
       create the illusion of importance, answered the Surgeon General's
       call to collect anatomical specimens of war wounds by donating his
       amputated leg to the U.S. Army Medical Museum. The shattered
       tibia/fibula resides to this day in the National Museum of Health
       and Medicine, and proudly represents the less well preserved
       balance of Sickles' body on periodic tours.
       After Sickles' impetuous decision to place his III Corp in an
       indefensible position far in advance of that specified in his
       orders - resulting in the "sitting duck" slaughter of his troops in
       the Peach Orchard at Gettysburg - it can reasonably be imagined
       that his commanding officer - General George Gordon Meade - would
       have shattered his other leg with relish, had a discreet
       opportunity presented itself.
       As with George W. Bush a century and a half later, Sickles led a
       charmed life that defied all logic, and in short order overcame his
       reputation for one of the Civil War's most glaring blunders, and as
       is common with notorious blunderers, was elected to Congress.
       So indelibly did he rewrite his own history via the magic of
       political reciprocity, that in 1897 he was actually awarded the
       freaking Medal of Honor for his Civil War "heroics!"
       So, if you think the absurdity of electing yokels like Louis
       Gohmert to Congress is a decidedly 21st century phenomenon,
       remember one Daniel Edgar Sickles from the 19th.  And don't be
       overly surprised when they drape the Medal of Honor around Louie's
       neck for his army service, which consisted mostly of defense
       lawyering.  Can you imagine putting your freedom - not to mention
       your life - in the hands of one Louie Gohmert?  (Your honor, my
       client did not do it.  I personally witnessed a former terror baby
       commit the crime.  Yes, your honor, I forgot to recuse myself,
       but...)
       As a Texan, I am chagrined that Gohmert apparently represents the
       upper echelon of intelligence in the state, having served three
       terms as a state district judge, and temporarily serving under a
       Rick Perry appointment as Chief Justice of Texas' 12th Court of
       Appeals for six months.
       The appointment being temporary, and Texas Appeal Court judges
       being elected officials, we Texans can take shaky solace in the
       fact that the voters of Texas are not quite as stupid as the
       governor they have elected three times, making him the longest
       serving governor in Texas history.  Not quite, but damn close.

   I had to vote for Paulie LePage in the poll. He's mean, he's a bully,
   and when he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps (with a lot of help
   from some very connected Republicans) he vowed that if he'd ever become
   Governor, he'd outlaw other people even having bootstraps. He's about
   the poorest excuse for a Frenchman Maine has ever seen.

   EFF YOU, Paulie.

   CHEERS to finally having that new fridge on the way.

   CHEERS to seeing my uncle yesterday who has stopped by for a week in
   Portland on his way back to Oakland from Iceland.

   CHEERS to my brand new weed-whacker. I splurged a little and purchased
   the brush cutter attachment for it. Boy, can I use it.

   CHEERS for vacation. I managed the very difficult task of securing a
   sub musician for Sunday. Sunday I'm heading up to Stonington to see my
   good friend Nancy who recently moved Down East. I'm looking forward to
   a few days on Deer Isle catching up with my good friend.

   CHEERS to BiPM, CSM and of course, all of you. Happy Thursday!

   Grats to all the couples that married last night. I'll be going to my
   first wedding of the season tommorrow.

   It's a tad bittersweet for me. I think it was 10 years ago that Rachel
   and I took part in an event at Minneapolis City Hall where the very
   same Mayor Rybak recognized our civil partnerships. Rachel died in
   early 2006, and never got to see this day. I'm both happy and sad right
   now. I miss her very much.

       I remember a feeling I had, when I was 10, something changed and
       all the hope went out of the world. I didn't understand anything
       about it at the time but I believe it had to do with Robert Kennedy
       and MLKjr's deaths.

       I hardly think what Japan needs is a return to totalitarianism. On
       the other hand, it is somewhat comforting to know that Japan has as
       unhinged rightists just like we do in the US. I know that sounds a
       bit perverse, but, well, misery loves company.

       It's all up to the attitude of the director. There is some truth to
       that, because it's easy to let your guard down after a good dress.
       The director's job (be it musical, theatrical, dance, whatever) is
       to keep people pumped, but keep them focused.
       When I was the musical director for a professional theatre company,
       I used to make sure that on opening night there were written notes
       for the band on their music stands when they came in about details
       to watch for that could have been better in the dress. I also
       included notes for myself in those notes, so the band knew I was
       paying attention to where I needed to watch out.

       My choir has a time for centering and focus before our
       performances, which helps us to focus on what we need to do and our
       motivations for giving a great performance. It helps to get rid of
       all the numerous distractions of the day and just relax. Helps with
       the performance jitters as well.

   1) they must be referred to as "loverly," not "lovely".
   2) they must be standing in a row

   Also, every government building must be named after the GIPPER, who
   must be referred to as "The Great, Wise, and Holy GIPPER (on whom be
   pee)". Failure to comply (to include chuckling, head-wagging,
   phumphering, and saying "There you go again" or anything else in a

   Happy birthday to Hans Rott, student of Bruckner, friend and

   my wife would nominate the governor her home state of Florida - Rick
   Scott, otherwise known as Skeletor, but for shear lack of gray matter
   and obliviousness it would be the Texas governor for me.  Now it is a
   tough field and highly competitive, (especially with Walker in it) but
   then we are a very competitive society, even in the race to the bottom.
    Note that our  governor, Martinez, is not even listed, despite her
   incompetence.  Mere incompetence will get you nowhere in this group.
   You have to be spectacularly insane, as well as incompetent to, reach
   the inverted pinnacles of awfulness. She just does not have what it

   Jeers to whatever primitive payroll methods they use back at the
   Central Office.  My invoices and check requests were in a day early,
   but the boss was on the road, and they only accept his signature for
   payroll.  Nobody on direct deposit got paid.  I have a mortgage.  I am
   royally pissed.

   Jeers to this soggy, fungused summer.  I have one tomato plant left,
   the monstrous grafted Brandywine, which despite pruning, is about ten
   feet tall and has produced four tomatoes.  Everything else died of
   blight.  It's raining now, and I can hear a toad croaking.

   Jeers to my hairdresser.  She tries to do too many things at once.  I
   am always her first customer - I hate to wait - but  yesterday morning
   one of her in-laws was already there, head covered with foil, and my
   hair is not the sandy brown it should be, but dark, with a leaning
   towards red.  I hate it.

   I am too mad to have anything but jeers this morning.

   You forgot Bobby "Wonder Boy" Jindal. In case you forgot he's Gov of
   Louisiana, Why? I don't know because he hates us! Well, he hates anyone
   who didn't vote for him.
   He refused Fed $ to built a railroad to Nola and yesterday was the last
   day of the bus service to Nola which was established after Katrina so
   people could get to work.
   He closed the charity hospital (Earl K Long) and moved operations to a
   catholic hospital which is located across town from the people who use
   it. It will take them about 3 hours to get there. I could go on and on
   (haven't even touched what he did to education here)
   He's an ass and should be in the top three at least!

   ...including the phrase "Of these..."

   That means it's not "the" list of worst governors, it's just "my gently
   suggested" list of worst governors from which to choose.

   Jindal went through my mind, but I think I left him off because he
   called the GOP "the stupid party."  That would look lovely on a bumper
   sticker.

   So, anyway.  I'll keep [DEL: Gilligan :DEL] Jindal in mind for the next
   poll about GOP governors.  I do 'em every so often.

   As commented above, I actually had to think about who to pick--easy
   choice? The oh, so charming Rick Scott. But for worst? Let's go with
   the guy setting precedent on how okay it is to dismantle local
   government. That he can callously toss aside a history of elected
   representational government (yes, I KNOW it doesn't always really work
   that way) and replace it with appointees? That he can say "we don't
   care that you voted like this," and appoint people to sell off city
   assets, take property, etc....ayiyiyiyi. I generally don't use the word
   "unamerican," because the point of our history is largely that you can
   kind of really do what you want so how can anything be truly
   unamerican...but seriously. Also, Bill, seriously? You couldn't let us
   pick three or something?

   Cheers to the gigantic blue jay that has discovered something
   interesting outside my apartment. For the past few days, it comes up
   and looks like it's hovering, hummingbird style, for several seconds
   before flying off. Same spot every time. I don't see anything, but it
   must.

   Cheers to the big green thing that just knocked up against the outside
   of my office window. Either a gigantic grasshopper or a luna moth. I
   know--how often do you see those choices put together?

   General cheers to the fascinating wildlife outside my office :-)

   Jeers to too much work -- one of those weeks where new projects with
   short deadlines are hitting my desk before I've gotten to the last one.
   Am still editing the second page of a two-page article that I've been
   trying to edit since yesterday....and ten more to follow just to get
   the first project of the day done. Love the work, hate these kinds of
   weeks or days because I'm resetting priorities about every half hour
   and I end up late on my real work. Ah, well. It really, truly, could be
   worse.

   In its wisdom, the state of Texas did not endow the governor with very
   much power. But while he may not be the worst governor, I'll grant that
   Mr. Perry is The Biggest Turkey (apologies to any turkeys whom I may

       Jindal:

     That means it's not "the" list of worst governors, it's just "my

   I think Boehner would've called it the other way.  Because the "chicken
   came first" argument is the Biblical view -- God created the chicken,
   not the egg.  Whereas the "egg came first" side is the evolutionist
   view -- the First Chicken hatched from an egg that was laid by
   something that was not quite a chicken, not quite evolved there yet.

   This .signature unintentionally left blank.
