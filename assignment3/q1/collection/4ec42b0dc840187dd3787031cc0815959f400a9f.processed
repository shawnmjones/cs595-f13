Day 2 at the UN: Uniting against Polio

     Polio has almost been eradicated from the face of the Earth - but
     not quite, not yet. In New York on Thursday, heads of state and
     other world leaders came together to recommit to finally closing the
     door on this disease. It was very inspiring.

   Thursday was an outstanding day. The main reason for my trip to New
   York was to attend a meeting hosted by the Secretary-General of the
   United Nations where the heads of state from Afghanistan, Nigeria and
   Pakistan stood alongside donor government officials and new donors from
   the public and private sector to outline what we need to do to stamp
   out polio. It was a remarkable display of solidarity, energy and
   commitment. It was an honor to be there.

   Anyone who visits this website regularly knows that polio eradication
   is my number one priority and an area that I spend a lot of my time on
   at the foundation.

   Thursday's event was a fundamental step forward on the path to
   finishing the job of ending this terrible disease. The
   Secretary-General called it a "[13]decisive moment" and I think anyone
   who was in the room, or watched online, would have to agree.

   I had the chance to meet privately with the presidents of Afghanistan,
   Nigeria and Pakistan, and they all reaffirmed their public commitments
   to doing everything they possibly can to end this disease. Backing them
   up were commitments from the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the
   Centers for Disease Control to aid in this important work. Australian
   Prime Minister Julia Gillard reaffirmed her country's support for the
   effort, and the Islamic Development bank [14]announced significant
   funding for Afghanistan and Pakistan to pursue polio campaigns. The
   U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius also joined
   us, highlighting the long-standing and continuing generosity of the
   U.S. in this battle.

   Rotary International, which has been working on this for 25 years,
   reminded us of our need to seize the moment and finish the job. Sandro
   Rosell who's President of Football Club Barcelona and their foundation,
   announced the club's engagement on the polio issue in collaboration
   with Etisalat, the largest telecomm operator in the Middle East. (You
   can find a list of all the speakers and their key points [15]here.)

   We will be going to work full-steam on a comprehensive plan that gets
   us to a polio-free world, and I hope we'll have something to announce
   in six months' time. Today's announcements were an excellent start.

   Dr. Margaret Chan, the head of the World Health Organization, said it
   very nicely. "No single one of us can bring this long, hard drive over
   the last hurdle. But together we can."

   Ending polio is not impossible. But it is not inevitable. It will
   require the courage and commitment of many. But the evidence is clear:
   if we all do our part, we can and will end this disease.
