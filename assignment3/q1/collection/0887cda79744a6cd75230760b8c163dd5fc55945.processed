   [29][hqb9kpnw0rl3kw5ffdt5_normal.png] Tea party leader says IRS'
   targeting of conservatives is like a "dictatorship" [30]http://t.co/...
   -- [31]@HuffPostPol via [32]The Huffington Post
   [33]Stanley Fish has a thoughtful essay on what makes the tea party and
   the NRA crazy:

     As Police Chief Johnson said, [the tyranny argument of LaPierre and
     others] is creepy and scary, but is it -- to return to my original
     musings -- un-American? Yes and no. On the one hand, nothing can be
     more American than throwing off the shackles of a government that
     has overstepped its bounds and disregarded the rights of its
     citizens. That's how it all began. ("No taxation without
     representation.") But on the other hand, the American tradition of
     accepting the results of elections -- even when they bring with them
     policies you believe to be misguided at best and disastrous at worst
     -- is in danger of being undermined when groups of armed people
     decide that the present leadership is infected by unpatriotic,
     socialist ideas and must be resisted at all costs.

   Pass the freedom fries.

   [34]Maggie Fox:

     To pediatricians, gun control is a public health issue, not a
     political one. But they're treading a fine line, and they know it.

     The American Academy of Pediatrics has begun a renewed push to try
     to get Congress to pass gun control measures, sending more than 100
     pediatricians to Capitol Hill earlier this month. But others who
     have taken on the issue over the past decade have a warning for
     them: they can run afoul of the National Rifle Association and other
     pro-gun groups that are quick to paint anyone who advocates for gun
     control as a political extremist.

     What the doctors want is an assault weapon ban, mandatory background
     checks and waiting periods before all firearm purchases, a ban on
     high-capacity magazines, handgun regulations and requirements for
     safe firearm storage under federal law.

   We won't get it all, or all at once. But the start is mandatory
   background checks, with maybe safe firearms storage laws.

   [35]Charlie Cook:

     While Republicans Rant About Benghazi and IRS, Public Mostly Yawns

     Benghazi and IRS controversies have Republicans up in arms, but they
     might not hurt President Obama's approval ratings.

   More politics and policy below the fold.

   [36]Greg Sargent:

     The IRS scandal appears to be growing. The news that the Justice
     Department targeted Associated Press phone records has justifiably
     triggered a vociferous outcry. The Benghazi tale is mostly a bogus
     "scandal," but it continues to be treated as the real thing by
     reporters who should know better. We're looking at investigations
     that stretch over the horizon. The air is thick with talk about
     Obama's "second term curse," and the possibility that the
     administration could find its credibility damaged by the scandal
     pile-up is very real.

     But cut through the noise and jubilation among Republicans and
     conservatives, and a basic fact about our current political dynamic
     remains in place: Republicans still need to figure out how to get
     their base to stop damaging the party's efforts to remake itself.

   [37]Paul Waldman:

     It's hard to overstate how frustrated Republicans have been over the
     last few years by their failure to gin up a juicy Obama
     administration scandal.

     They tried with Solyndra and "Fast and Furious," but those turned
     out to be gigantic nothing burgers. Well now at last, they may have
     something, in either Benghazi or the IRS targeting conservative
     groups. Unlike Benghazi, where even the Republicans claiming it was
     "worse than Watergate" can't quite say what the misconduct was
     (unless you consider squabbling over talking points to be a
     nefarious and earth-shattering crime), the IRS affair is pretty
     straightforward.

   OTOH, if you want an example of self-important "it's about me"
   reporting, there's always [38]Politico:

     The town is turning on President Obama - and this is very bad news
     for this White House.

     Republicans have waited five years for the moment to put the screws
     to Obama - and they have one-third of all congressional committees
     on the case now. Establishment Democrats, never big fans of this
     president to begin with, are starting to speak out. And reporters
     are tripping over themselves to condemn lies, bullying and shadiness
     in the Obama administration.

   Oh, my goodness.

   Meanwhile, in the real world, [39]Ian Reifowitz writes about Kosovo and
   Serbia:

     After protracted, months-long negotiations, Kosovo and Serbia
     recently agreed to a compromise on sovereignty and autonomy that
     would end two decades of conflict. In extinguishing the last embers
     of war in what was Yugoslavia -- the volatile, ethnically divided
     nation where the assassination of an Austrian archduke launched
     World War I, and where civil war throughout the nineties led to
     ethnic cleansing and other atrocities -- Europe is nearing the end
     of its long journey to overcome its tribal enmities and build a
     cohesive, peaceful civilization.

   Just a reminder there's life beyond what Politico thinks is important.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Auditing? How did this subject get introduced? ([108]4+ / 0-)

       Granted, the IRS doesn't conduct enough audits of major financial
       players, mainly because it takes years to conduct the audits and
       personnel to do so are in short supply - not to mention the
       financial resources available to those being audited to delay,
       object and eventually thwart the IRS auditing process.
       But I'm still clueless about how the subject of audits (IRS audits,
       I assume) has anything to do with the topics under discussion in
       today's APR.

       They applied for 501(c)4 (tax exempt status), and the IRS was
       giving extra scrutiny to their applications.

       thank you United States Supreme Court.
       501(c)4 applications skyrocketed because of The Court's assanine
       ruling. The huge loophole that it created to engage in political
       shenanigans was a terrible blow to democracy. The public's sudden
       attraction to a 501(c)4 was not one of public welfare, but one of
       skulduggery.
       ALL 501(c)4 corporations need to be reviewed; past, present, and
       future. Tax cheating is tax cheating.

       and then there's the repeated budget-blocking, debt-ceiling
       mongering, and sequestering.
       They've all taken "the party of No" to levels we never imagined,
       and so far, have been pretty successful.
       They won't be able to repeal the ACA, but they are doing their
       damndest to make sure it can't get implemented -- by cutting off
       funding to HHS, and then blasting the Secretary for looking for
       private funding to replace that, and etc. etc. etc.

       It's about elections.  They don't care if people hate Congress.  As
       long as they hate all of Congress - which is often the case.  GOP
       banks on continual control of the House via gerrymandered Districts
       and then they hope to snipe off a few Senate seats to take the
       Senate.
       Even if that ends up not working they know their out is easy as
       their base is forgiving... no... adores the repentant sinner type.
        So if their gamble fails through 2016 then they just come a crying
       and beating their chests about how bad they were and how they now
       see the light.

 GOP is not interested in Government shutdown ([212]1+ / 0-)

          [213]Ian Reifowitz

   or reducing any of the powers that the Goverment can have; instead they
   want to reduce the amount of power that the Democrats can wield through
   government.

   For all of their talk of "Big Government" and their pandering to the
   libertarian crowd about reducing the Federal Government and returning
   more power to the States, the reality is that the GOP loves the power
   that the Federal Goverment has, and in fact want more of it.

   The GOP wants these scandals out right now, so that in 2014 only the
   righties will be enraged, while the rest of the public has a collective
   "meh" and doesn't come out in huge numbers. This will likely result in
   the Dems losing the Senate.

   But, it sets up a perfect storm in 2016 when Dems and Libertarians
   realize that we are actuallyvery much on the same team.

   Jerry Zeifman, someone I've never heard of according to this "article"
   is a "lifelong Democrat".
   Where have I heard that one before?
   Also, in a google search, came upon this in a comment in a diary (right
   in the heat of The Great DK Obama/Hillary War:
   [299]http://www.washingtonpost.com/...

     WITHOUT HONOR
     In 1973 Jerry Zeifman, chief counsel to the House Judiciary
     Committee, decided to keep a diary of the "extraordinary events"
     surrounding the impeachment of President Nixon. Now, Zeifman draws
     on that diary to give us Without Honor: Crimes of Camelot and the
     Impeachment of President Nixon, in which he accuses government
     officials of obstructing the impeachment inquiry. Their reason? Not
     any sympathy for the besieged Richard Nixon, but a desire to protect
     the reputation of John Kennedy. Zeifman's book will surely excite
     conspiracy buffs on the lookout for sinister coverups in high
     places. But those wary of such unsubstantiated theories (myself
     included) will find Zeifman's book an unconvincing, if imaginative,
     tale of intrigue.

   One question. Do you think that ethnic nationalism in Europe is
   shifting as opposed to receding? While it's true ethnic nationalism in
   relations between European countries has waned since the creation of
   the EU (such as the relationship between France and Germany), there are
   still, in my opinion highly nationalistic tendencies when it comes to
   those outside of the EU (Turkish immigrants, North African immigrants.

       Compared to the Nazi-era. But that's obviously a low bar to clear.
       While there are still the tendencies you mentioned, those have been
       there for a while. The trend in the Balkans, the most likely to
       erupt into open warfare, is a positive one.

       I also worry about the rise of right-wing groups in countries like
       Greece and Spain. Golden Dawn has seen its support skyrocket in
       Greece and there are allegations that the police are complicit in
       their attacks against minorities.

     At polling places specifically designated for police, Golden Dawn
     received as much as 23.7 percent of the vote.

       While I don't think you'd see open warfare in Greece, there is
       still a real possibility that human rights abuses will continue as
       more people begin to sympathize with these radical right-wing
       groups.

       The BNP has no seats in Parliament but used to have some local

       OK the mainstream parties are less than stellar when it comes to
       minorities' rights, but they are salvageable.  UKIP are mainly an
       anti-foreigner party, anti-EU, so even pure Scandinavians are

       are a lot better than the southern EU countries for a number of
       reasons though. (1) They have lower unemployment rates than the
       southern countries, and unemployment usually goes hand-in-hand with
       anti-immigration movements. (2) The southern countries, especially
       Greece, Italy and Spain are the main through ways for immigrants
       coming into the EU. (3) The austerity programs in the southern
       countries are taking support away from more traditional parties and
       right-wing groups are using this to their advantage. At this point
       Golden Dawn along with the other Greece right-wing groups have over
       20% popular support. As long as austerity continues and employment
       continues to stagnate I think they will become more popular.

   No question. An improving overall trend does not mean there will be no

   important, as is remaining on the lookout for problems and, for those

   to the status of real atrocities. Maybe if Americans paid more

   gin up so much outrage over bad things that still don't rise to the

   They were just doing their job, just in an uneven manner.  TV viewers
   are sick to death of endless political commericals.  Americans for
   Prosperity and Crossroads GPS and other 501(c)4s like them don't call
   the ads political so they can continue their charade as non-profit
   'social welfare' groups.  Clarifying the tax code and donor disclosure
   are needed.

   Nixon used the IRS to harass peace groups and women's liberation groups
   back in the 70's.  I haven't heard that mentioned on any newscasts,

   big bucks for political ads.  They avoided questioning the applications
   of groups that had big bucks to hire lawyers and political operatives
   to fight IRS investigations into their applications and to oppose the
   IRS' requests for more information.  The IRS doesn't have the resources
   to engage a fight with an organization that has hundreds of millions of
   dollars to fight the IRS application process and the political heft to
   raise a big public stink about them.

   Same reason the IRS audits individuals, organizations and businesses
   with fewer financial resources - it's easier, it's faster, and it takes
   far fewer IRS resources to close the cases.

   The American Academy of Pediatrics has the following practice
   recommendation:

   "The AAP recommends that pediatricians incorporate questions about the
   presence and availability of firearms into their patient history taking
   and urge parents who possess guns to prevent access to these guns by
   children." (1)

   A pediatrician who was following this practice guideline pissed off a
   gun fetishist mother.  That fetishist got a law passed that prohibits a
   physician from questioning a patient about the presence of guns in the
   home.  Florida pediatricians are ignoring the law and are fighting it
   in court. (2)

   The NRA, in addition to effectively stopping epidemiological studies of
   gun injuries, has proposed legislation in several states that would
   prohibit health care providers from questioning patients about guns in
   the home. (2)

 It's a child protection issue. ([676]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [677]Ian Reifowitz

   I don't know about other states, but here in California, children can
   be removed from their parents' custody if the parents demonstrate a
   failure to protect their children from harm.  If the recent case of a
   five-year-old shooting his two-year-old sibling had happened here in
   California, child protective services could have removed the surviving
   child from the parents' custody for the child's protection.  If you
   can't keep your kids away from guns, you're not taking proper care of
   them.

   Pediatricians need to be able to discuss these things with their
   patients' parents, if for no other reason than to ensure that parents
   are aware of what the consequences of keeping guns in the house can be.
    Those consequences can be both physical and legal.

     "Social welfare" is a term of art that doesn't mean exactly what it
     sounds like. To qualify, a group must have the aim of producing
     benefits that accrue to the community as a whole, not just its
     members. "Benefit" and "community" are construed broadly;
     organizations do not have to demonstrate that the policies they
     promote are good or that they benefit everyone.
     You can see this in the IRS regulations governing 501(c)(4) groups.
     These groups may engage in unlimited lobbying related to their
     social welfare missions. The IRS offers these specific examples of
     acceptable activity: "promotion of legislation on animal rights,"
     "advocacy of anti-abortion legislation," "legalization of currently
     illegal activity" and "advocacy of changes in the tax law."

       AP... very unclear. Law enforcement issue? Dunno yet. Don't like
       it, though. prefer negotiation and specific and not blanket
       requests.
       Are any of these really, really big issues? NO. But reporters are

        Recommended by:
                [794]Ian Reifowitz, [795]tb mare

       from WaPo, what the DoJ did was legal:

     On Monday the Associated Press reported that the Justice Department
     "secretly obtained two months of telephone records of reporters and
     editors for The Associated Press." But here's what's really scary:
     The Justice Department's actions are likely perfectly legal.

     U.S. law allows the government to engage in this type of
     surveillance--on media organizations or anyone else--without
     meaningful judicial oversight.
     The key here is a legal principle known as the "third party
     doctrine," which says that users don't have Fourth Amendment rights
     protecting information they voluntarily turn over to someone else.
     Courts have said that when you dial a phone number, you are
     voluntarily providing information to your phone company, which is
     then free to share it with the government.

   True (kindof):

     nothing can be more American than throwing off the shackles of a

     rights of its citizens

   But neither the Tea Party or NRA are about the rights of citizens, they
   are about the dictatorship of their membership: the right to
   intimidate, harass, and maintain an essentially feudal order.  When is
   the last time the Tea Party or the NRA advocated young black men to
   carry arms to political events...???  I'm hardly suggesting this is a
   good idea (young/old/black/white - it would be equally stupid).  But
   the Tea Party and NRA are all about the tyranny of cranky old white men

     out conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status for extra
     scrutiny. If that turns out to be true, then it was absolutely wrong
     and the people responsible should be held to account, as everyone in
     both parties up to and including President Obama has agreed. But
     this controversy shines a light on a larger problem in the way our

 Greg, thanks for Stanley Fish article -- ([882]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [883]Ian Reifowitz

   I just read Stanley Fish's NYT article here
   [884]http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/...

   Thanks so much for posting this.

   Although Fish as framed his article around the NRA, I found the RW
   positions he includes to be expressions of the Nullification/Tenther
   school (if I can dignify it by calling it a school).

   Over the last few days, while reading one of Frank Coccozoli's
   'Nullification' diaries here, I had a kind of breakthrough of
   understanding about that thinking.  The concepts (like  the 'patriot's'
   right and obligation to resist 'Tyranny' by whatever means necessary)
   and the emotional charge they carry go back (at least) to John C
   Calhoun, who was a major political player from around 1811, from the
   time of Monroe's presidency through Jackson's and into Van Buren's.
   Doing a little preliminary research on Calhoun's work, I was astonished
   to find that his actual phrasing is being repeated by today's
   Nullifier/Tenthers.

   In Fish's article, several of his citations of NRA people's positions
   are framed in Calhoun's terms.  And one such quote makes it clear that
   today's Calhounists take their assumed 'power of nullification' down to
   the level of the individual:

     "We are all to decide what tyranny is. Just as we decide what law we
     obey or not."

 It's pretty rational ([899]0+ / 0-)

   to expect that failure to keep a firearm in a safe position should be
   sanctionable behavior.

     But the start is mandatory background checks, with maybe safe
     firearms storage laws.

   All those accidental discharges? There are just too many conscious
   steps that have to take place before any firearm can "accidentally"
   discharge. No need to prove willful negligence in order to charge
   reckless endangerment.

   There are not accidental discharges. The purpose of a chambered round
   is, by definition, there to be discharges sometime afterward. Failure
   of the gun owner to choose the time, place, direction of discharge is
   reckless endangerment.
