Watch out for voter registration cancellations

   [206]Walter Pinkston, a Friendswood retiree and faithful Harris County
   voter, got a letter in late March asking his family to confirm that he
   was dead - which he was not - and warning that he was about to be
   purged from Texas voter rolls.

   Retired [207]Houston Baptist University Professor [208]Trilla Pando
   received a similar notice of her death from voter registration
   officials in 2010.

   Even [209]Sylvia Garcia, a former Harris County commissioner, got
   suspended - not because anyone thought she was dead - but because
   county officials questioned the accuracy of a street address the
   Houston native had used on her voting card for years.

   More than 300,000 valid voters were notified they could be removed from
   Texas rolls from November 2008 to November 2010 - often because they
   were mistaken for someone else or failed to receive or respond to
   generic form letters, according to [210]Houston Chronicle interviews
   and analysis of voter registration data.

   Garcia ended up on a "suspended voters list" in 2003 after county
   officials say she failed to respond to a notice to  confirm her
   address. Though her office was then just upstairs from the voter
   registration office, Garcia says she never got that letter.

   "How can you suspend someone without notice? To me we should be
   actively engaging people - we should not be adding any barrier to
   vote," said Garcia, who works to boost voter participation of Hispanics
   nationwide as president of the [211]National Association of Latino
   Elected and Appointed Officials.

   1 of 10 suspended

   Statewide, more than 1.5 million voters could be on the path to
   cancellation if they fail to vote or to update their records for two
   consecutive federal elections: One out of every 10 Texas voters'
   registration is currently suspended. Among voters under 30, the figure
   is about one in five.

   Texas voter registration rates are among the lowest in the nation, but
   Texas pays nearly twice as much to cancel voters - 40 cents per
   cancellation - as it does to register new ones at 25 cents.

   State and federal laws require the nation's voter rolls be regularly
   reviewed and cleaned to remove duplicates and eliminate voters who
   moved away or died. But across Texas, such "removals" rely on outdated
   computer programs, faulty procedures and voter responses to generic
   form letters, often resulting in the wrong people being sent
   cancellation notices, including new homeowners, college students,
   Texans who work abroad and folks with common names, a Chronicle review
   of cancellations shows.

   'Subject to error'

   The Secretary of State's office says it automatically cancels voters
   only when there is a "strong match" between a new registration and an
   older existing voter - such as full name, [212]Social Security number
   and/or date of birth.

   However, each year thousands of voters receive requests to verify voter
   information or be cancelled because they share the same name as a voter
   who died, got convicted of a crime or claimed to be a non-citizen to
   avoid jury duty. Those voters receive form letters generated by workers
   in county election offices that "therefore may be more subject to
   error," said [213]Rich Parsons, a spokesman for the Secretary of State
   in emailed responses to the newspaper. Voters who fail to respond to
   form letters - or never receive them - get dropped.

   Statewide, 21 percent of the people who received purge letters later
   proved they were valid voters, compared with 16 percent in Harris
   County, according to a Chronicle analysis of the latest [214]U.S.
   Election Assistance Commission data. Other counties had higher
   percentages: 37 percent of voters who received removal letters in
   Galveston County were valid voters, 40 percent in Bexar County and 70
   percent in Collin County.

   Mistaken for dead man

   Pinkston, the Friends-wood retiree, was mistaken for a dead man in
   March because he shared a relatively unusual first, middle and last
   name with a stranger of a different age who died in Colorado, according
   to county information and public records.

   "That seems like a very flimsy set of facts and reasoning to go about
   challenging my right to vote," said Pinkston, who responded in time to
   save his registration. "And in my opinion, that's a very flimsy set of
   circumstances to spend Harris County taxpayers' money to investigate
   the matter, even if it's only a few dollars in postage and associated
   costs."

   Errors 'inevitable'

   In Harris County alone, more than 100,000 voters share their name with
   at least one other voter. The phenomenon is even more common among
   Hispanics - a fact that worries voter participation activists like
   Garcia, the former county commissioner, who shares her name with 35
   other county voters.

   Harris County has been challenged in a civil lawsuit for aggressive
   purges, but it generally followed accepted state procedures and has
   been more accurate in targeting voters for cancellation than other
   counties, statistics and case studies show.

   "We appreciate your newspaper's thorough investigation of these issues
   and possible solutions," said [215]Tax Assessor Collector Don Sumners.
   "The Harris County Tax Office is following the law ... No errors are
   acceptable but some number is inevitable."

   Pando, the retired professor, said her 2008 application to vote in the
   presidential elections was rejected for unexplained reasons when she
   moved back to Texas to retire. Her erroneous death notice arrived two
   years later - after a woman who shared her maiden name died in another
   state. "If I had not been so passionate about voting I probably would
   have just let it go," said Pando.
