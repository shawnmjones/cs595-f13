Sandy aid passes Senate despite GOP opposition

   It's taken far longer than it should have, but federal aid for areas
   affected by Hurricane Sandy is [3]finally on the way.

     The Senate Monday night passed a $50.5 billion emergency spending
     bill to aid people in New York and New Jersey who are trying to
     rebuild their homes and businesses after last October's devastation
     from super-storm Sandy.

     The vote was 62 to 36, with 60 votes needed for passage.

   The vote came nearly two weeks after the House [4]approved an identical
   measure, and sends the bill to the White House for President Obama's
   signature.

   But before we move on, it's worth pausing to note the partisan split on
   Sandy relief -- in the Senate, [5]36 Senate Republicans, including
   members representing coastal states like Florida, Texas, Alabama, and
   the Carolinas, voted against the federal aid. Or put another way, 80%
   of Senate Republicans opposed post-Sandy relief.

   In the House, we saw roughly the same outcome -- 78% of House
   Republicans [6]voted against the emergency assistance.

   What we're seeing, in other words, is a fundamental shift in how GOP
   policymakers respond to communities struggling after a natural
   disaster.
     __________________________________________________________________

   For generations, these votes were not politicized or considered
   particularly controversial -- Americans could count on their elected
   representatives to step up if a natural disaster struck. It wasn't
   partisan and it wasn't ideological; this is just what the country did.
   It was a reflection of who we are.

   And those days are over. As the Sandy votes demonstrate, it is now
   effectively the standard position of congressional Republicans to
   reject disaster relief unless the funding is offset by other spending
   cuts. So long, compassionate conservatism, we hardly knew you.

   At least the tax hike on the rich went to a good cause. It's all gone
   for this year.

   But who knew there was problems with Sandy victims? They've been
   blacked out of the media so Obama doesn't look bad. If this had been
   Bush, network quarters would have been set up and desperate pictures
   sent out every day. This is proof positive that the news is tailored
   for politics. Only having Obama as president would have killed an
   otherwise pithy story. Bias? IOKIYAD.

   That's poppycock. There has been lots of coverage about this! Just
   recently the coverage showed the difficulty people are having coping
   with the cold snap.

   BTW, I live in an area that very rarely needs disaster relief. I don't
   have a problem seeing my tax dollars going to help people out - over
   and over and over - when hurricanes (too far inland here), tornados (we
   get really little ones once in a while), wild fires (not a problem
   here), earthquakes (nope not here), drought (nope not here)...

   I am pretty disgusted with the Republicans who voted against this -
   from areas that have received aid over and over and over. Perhaps we
   should think twice next time they ask for help.

   struggles. Looks like it's just the Conservative Media - Fox, CNN, CBS
   News, etc - that's removed them from the spotlight.

   Sandy was more severe than Katrina, caused more damage over a wider
   area, and affected more people. Make no mistake - There are still
   people suffering its effects.

   That said, because the recovery efforts were run by an effective
   community organizer instead of a horses ass in a playland flightsuit,
   we don't have the widespread lingering effects of the devestation.

   Yes, Shooter, I know you can search the interwebs for some scraps of
   proof that show some stuff still not fixed - Go talk to the House GOP
   who held up aid for 3 months.

   In the recent elections, my district, NC-8, voted out its Blue Dog
   Democrat-who-voted-like-a-Republican and voted in a Teapublican -
   Richard Hudson. You know - big difference, right? I recently let Hudson
   know via email how disgusted I am about his anti-aid votes (I never was
   shy about blasting former-Representative Kissell, so I'm keeping up the
   tradition of crusty, complaining constituent).

   To my surprise, I received a long and gracious reply on official email
   letterhead. It was, however full of Republican propaganda about the
   national debt and pork and it just didn't sit well, coming, as it did,
   from a Congressman from a delegation in hurricane country. I called
   bullpucky on it. My final paragraph:

   "Americans do *not* refuse help to those in need when they need help.
   That includes the victims of natural disasters, the poor, the elderly,
   wounded warriors, the unemployed and those without healthcare. We may
   ask the more fortunate among us to pay more in taxes and we may end
   corporate subsidies for Big Oil. We may re-jigger our budgetary
   priorities toward reducing and streamlining our military forces. We may
   put many more people back to work with some well-timed, federally
   funded projects to repair our crumbling Interstate bridges (thus
   putting much more money into the economy). We may also make use of the
   abundant and free wind off our Outer Banks in North Carolina to create
   electricity and thus, reduce dependence upon coal.

   But we do not refuse help to those in need. It is not the American
   way."

   The GOP rationale was the measure was not revenue neutral. Fine- we can
   take that theme and beat them to death with it. The hidden cost of
   burning fossil fuel is paid by society. Instead, it is morally right to
   take that externality and feed it back into the dynamics of the market.
   Besides providing for revenue neutral way of paying for disasters, it
   will have benefits for reducing carbon and aiding US Industries who
   must obey EPA controls, versus companies who have exported the carbon
   pollution to countries who do not have any pollution restrictions.

   Prior to the next inevitable extreme weather event that will hit the
   South, we need to have a bill that establishes an Extreme weather
   disaster fund. The Fund will be defrayed by fines on Carbon Pollution-
   Both domestic and foreign. The Carbon Pollution content of products
   from high CO2 polluting countries is estimated, and duties levied on
   products from those countries to recoup the fines. Similarly, export of
   CO2 polluting energy such as coal, oil and Natural Gas is fined unless
   it is shown that that its CO2 will be sequestered.

   Domestically, if LNG is converted to Hydrogen and the CO2 sequestered,
   then there is no fine. Otherwise, US industry will no longer enjoy the
   privatization of profit, and socialization of the extreme weather
   hidden cost of that wealth extraction.

   It is time to end socialism for the Oil Industry.

   I am sorry to have left that impression. I intended that we beat them
   senseless with their own memes of financial responsibility. The right
   is giving up on their climate denialism. Colbert last night lampooned
   the transition, mentioning in particular Erick Erickson's transition to
   fatalism regarding Climate Change[57] (Media Matters article). Ok, take
   Erickson's message and cast him as an irresponsible child unwilling to
   live in a grown up world.

   A world we must pass to our children with climate conditions that are
   still able to support carbon based lifeforms.

   After all, it makes economic sense to do this. Or do the republicans
   have a problem with policies supportive of business?

   It is tempting to rationalize whether or not beating a horse merely
   bereft of a heartbeat is futile or beneficial . Understanding this , it
   becomes a necessary , and instructive employment . After all , if an
   occupied Erick Erickson can be mused upon , isn't that activity better
   exercised on something in the next world where the supposed subject of
   his worship may chide him on his heresy , softened by the praise of his
   fine style in laying it on metamorphosed tissue .

   If the moderation of their (collective) face is only discernible in the
   disappearance of an appliance , lets say a nose , then why yes we have
   no bananas today , with business , or the exceptionalism it is entitled
   to .

   So it is safe to say that the enlightened Republican Libertarian will
   partake in a rational negotiation of policy with the end of fitting
   reason in its conclusions , when you pry it out of its cold dead
   fingers .

   The first time the GOTea demanded that disaster relief be paid for by
   equal spending cuts elsewhere was in the Spring of 2011. That was when
   it was clear that Republicans had lost all sense of decency and could

   Here is the list

   o $2 million to repair damage to the roofs of museums in Washington,
   D.C., while many in Hurricane Sandy's path still have no roof over
   their own heads.

   o $150 million for fisheries as far away from the storm's path as
   Alaska.

   o $125 million for the Department of Agriculture's Emergency Watershed
   Protection program, which helps restore watersheds damaged by wildfires
   and drought.

   o $20 million for a nationwide Water Resources Priorities Study.

   o $15 million for NASA facilities, though NASA itself has called its
   damage from the hurricane `minimal.'

   o $50 million in subsidies for tree planting on private properties.

   o $336 million for taxpayer-supported [85]AMTRAK without any detailed
   plan for how the money will be spent.

   o $5.3 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers - more than the Corps'
   annual budget - with no statement of priorities about how to spend the
   money.

   o $12.9 billion for future disaster mitigation activities and studies,
   without identifying a single way to pay for it

   Insp.

   ok lets take that list apart shall we the total for the first seven
   things on that list comes to $698 Million dollars, that is Million with
   an "M" it amounts to less than one fiftieth that's (> 1/50th) of the
   total package and all of those things are related to the area of this
   bill in that they are important to Disaster prevention and response.

   The last two add up to $18.2 billion and I would say that if you are
   going to actualy work to prevent or at least mitigate future disasters
   then those are the agencys and things you would need to fund to do
   that.

   Further if you look at that list most of those programs have alocated
   significant portions of those funds to "Red" states as carrots to get
   the republicans to sign off on the damn bill to get the people in the
   north east taken care of.

   So there are two things going on here. First the GOP are pretending to
   be penny wise and pound foolish to make their base of brain dead
   rednecks happy and they are lying and being completely disingenuous
   about where the money is going so that they can keep those same brain
   dead rednecks happy at home.

   Why should builders even be allowed to build in flood plains? People
   assume that if a house is there, it must be ok. Or sometimes they were
   built in a fine place but the weather destroyed them. We have
   earthquakes out here, what do we do, make the entire state leave? How
   about tornados. That is a large swath of the country to deny Americans
   so they won't need FEMA/gov't money in a disaster.

   Builders as a rule only build where the client wants it built. If the
   builder is the developer the subdivision plans are submitted to the
   county. They are then overlayed on a county map that has topography and
   flood planes on it. Due diligence suggests that any home buyer take the
   time to fully understand all of the possible problems associated with
   the building. Currently appraisers are armed with this knowledge to
   assist the banks in telling whether the property is a good investment
   or not. The problem with New York and New Jersey is that most homes in
   he affected areas were built before there were zoning laws or building
   departments. As for the west coast I believe that all homeowners should
   assume the risk of building/living on a fault line. As I posted
   earlier, I live in tornado alley. My insurance company and I assume the
   responsibility associated with the rebuilding of my home. I never
   expect FEMA to come bail me out. When hurricane Katrina hit. most of
   the people that ended up homeless were already on public assistance. My
   take on this is that there are alot of people that don't have any
   survival skills at all, and it is just getting worse. Enabling people
   is not the best thing we can be doing right now.

   Here (in So Cal) they build tracks of houses in flood plains. Sure, it
   might normally be flooded every hundred years, but it seems wrong to
   me. Maybe the dry river bed has been dry for years, but heavy rains
   will bring huge problems. And while we were careful buying our house
   (specifically looking for a house on ground that is more stable in an
   earthquake), not every future disaster can be predicted. And since most
   people at the bottom of the ladder are working on daily survival needs,
   I don't think it is wrong to help them back on their feet when
   something happens. It's not like they are sitting on wads of cash to
   deal with these things.

   again before his term is over is the number of senators from tornado
   prone states who voted against it.

   Are we surprised that the Republicans are against disaster aid for blue
   states. Really, are we?

   Y'all are too kind. The Republicans have become a party of unprincipled
   mofo's that vote against ANYTHING that is not in' my backyard'. The
   UNITED STATES? Nope. They just want the tax dollars of those states but
   'do it yourself' if you need aid. In my neck of the woods we call those
   people grifters.

   To all those folks who are in the Teaparty...next time there's a
   disaster in your town, refuse the money from "Big
   Government"......return your Social Security checks, refuse to use
   Medicare/Medicaid (maybe you'll die sooner so intelligent people can
   replace your votes), don't use the highways built under the Eisenhower
   years with Federal money, stay out of the Federal Parks (that includes
   the monuments in Washington DC).

   To those Senators and Representatives in the Sandy-hit states, remember
   John D Rockefeller's motto the next time there's a hurricane that hits
   the Carolinas, or a flood in Tennesee, or a tornado in the south, or an
   earthquake in Alaska.......

   Don't get angry....get EVEN
