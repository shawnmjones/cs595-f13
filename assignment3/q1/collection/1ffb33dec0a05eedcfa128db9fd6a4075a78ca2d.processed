The Big History Project: Teachers - Come Take a Look at the Online Course

     After Big History's two-year pilot program, any educator can now
     request credentials to explore the Big History Project online
     courseware, as well as use and share any of the content they like.

   After two years of development, we are ready to share our progress on
   The Big History Project. As you'll remember, the Big History Project
   looks at 13.7 billion years of history - from the Big Bang to modernity
   - with a goal of revealing common themes and patterns that help
   students better understand people, civilizations and our place in the
   universe.

   The Big History Project is in the second year of a pilot program
   designed to create and refine a world-class curriculum and online
   experience that will ultimately be freely available to schools
   worldwide. More than 80 partner schools are enrolled in our current
   pilot program.

   So, now that we're into our second year, any educator can [15]request
   credentials to our online courseware and take a look, as well as use
   and share any of the content you like.  You can also apply to join our
   2013/14 pilot program, which is the last year of the pilot before the
   course opens up to the public.

   As you might remember, two years ago I met with David Christian on a
   trip down to San Diego. I had just finished taking his [16]online
   course on big history and really enjoyed it. In fact, it was - and
   still is - my favorite course of all time. It resonated with me because
   it seeks to do something audacious, but important:  lay out a
   "complete" view of history spanning all the way back to the Big Bang.

   The meeting with David was very productive, and after a discussion we
   decided to figure out a way to make big history available to high
   school students. Traditionally, the course had been taught at the
   university level, so we knew we were in for a lot of work making the
   curriculum and content work for younger students. But by working with
   some [17]amazing teachers and pilot schools, I think we've put together
   something really special, and now we're ready to make it available to
   others.

   We are still in a pilot phase. Our goal is to support both teachers and
   students participating in the course. We also want feedback on how it
   needs to be improved. But the online experience and content is far
   enough along that many different teachers can benefit.

   The content is really exciting. It mixes traditional video lectures
   with animations, texts and infographics. Our hope is the variety of
   formats helps to keep the course exciting and engaging while also
   helping students to absorb the material. A lot of it is visually
   beautiful, but more importantly, the content is built to bring the
   concepts to life and nurture both critical thinking and literacy
   skills. Big history helps develop the kind of literacy skills that are
   highlighted in the Common Core Standards now making their way into most
   every U.S. state curriculum.

   You can get a sense of [18]some of the content here. One of my favorite
   pieces is one on horses.  "The Little Big History of Horses" looks at
   the evolution of the horse, and how, once domesticated, it helped
   advance human communication and transportation, accelerating global
   change.  It's a great example of the way big history treats subjects
   differently by going back much further in time.

   Students in our pilot program generally report a much higher level of
   confidence relative to work in more specific science and history
   courses, and our evaluation of student work suggests strong growth in
   some key areas - like literacy skills. These outcomes are core to the
   course. Ultimately we want big history to provide a strong foundation
   for students, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to
   excel in more advanced courses.

   We also want more partners and test sites. Any teacher or administrator
   who explores the site and thinks that the course could work well for
   them can apply for our 2013/14 pilot program. We have lots of ideas
   about how the course can grow and get better - ranging from new content
   to more advanced class management functionality on the website - and it
   will be up to the schools and teachers in our last pilot program to
   really help us think through these ideas to get it right. It will be
   the last year of the pilot before we make the course broadly available
   to anyone for free.

   Later next year, we will be making the course content available to the
   general public online.  But for now, we're focusing only on teachers
   and administrators.

   I loved this course.  I hope you will too.
