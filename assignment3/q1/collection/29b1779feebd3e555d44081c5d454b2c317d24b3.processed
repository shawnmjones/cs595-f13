AP blasts feds for phone records search

   By Matt Smith and Joe Johns, CNN
   updated 10:19 AM EDT, Tue May 14, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: There'd better be a "damned good explanation" for subpoenas,
       Boehner spokesman says
     * NEW: Federal review of AP phone records is unprecedented but looks
       legal, Toobin says
     * The AP calls the subpoenas a "massive and unprecedented intrusion"
     * It says federal agents collected records from bureau and personal
       phone lines

   (CNN) -- The Justice Department secretly collected two months of
   telephone records for reporters and editors at The Associated Press,
   the news service disclosed Monday in an outraged letter to Attorney
   General Eric Holder.

   The records included calls from several AP bureaus and the personal
   phone lines of several staffers, AP President Gary Pruitt wrote. Pruitt
   called the subpoenas a "massive and unprecedented intrusion" into its
   reporting.

   "These records potentially reveal communications with confidential
   sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP
   during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering
   operations and disclose information about AP's activities and
   operations that the government has no conceivable right to know," wrote
   Pruitt, the news agency's CEO.

   The AP reported that the government has not said why it wanted the
   records. But it noted that U.S. officials have said they were probing
   how details of a foiled bomb plot that targeted a U.S.-bound aircraft
   leaked in May 2012. The news agency said records from five reporters
   and an editor who worked on a story about the plot were among those
   collected, but it said none of the information the government has
   shared with it suggested agents listened in on any reporters' calls.

   The news immediately raised questions among members of Congress.

   "The First Amendment is first for a reason," said Michael Steel, a
   spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. "If the Obama administration
   is going after reporters' phone records, they better have a damned good
   explanation."

   The subpoenas were disclosed to the news agency on Friday, Pruitt
   wrote. In all, federal agents collected records from more than 20
   lines, including personal phones and AP phone numbers in New York;
   Hartford, Connecticut; and Washington, he wrote.

   "We regard this action by the Department of Justice as a serious
   interference with AP's constitutional rights to gather and report the
   news," he told Holder. Pruitt demanded that the department return all
   records collected and destroy all copies.

   The U.S. attorney's office in Washington responded that federal
   investigators seek phone records from news outlets only after making
   "every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative
   means." It did not disclose the subject of the probe.

   "We must notify the media organization in advance unless doing so would
   pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation," it
   said. "Because we value the freedom of the press, we are always careful
   and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the
   public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest
   in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws."

   CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the Obama administration "has
   been incredibly aggressive" about prosecuting leakers, and there's no
   privilege in federal law that allows reporters to protect their
   sources. But he said past administrations have avoided going that far.

   "I have never heard of a subpoena this broad," Toobin said. "It's
   legal, as far as I can tell. The administration isn't violating the
   First Amendment. But they are certainly doing more than has ever been
   done before in pursuing the private information of journalists. And
   we'll see if there's any political check on them, because there doesn't
   appear to be any legal check on what they're doing."

   The White House was unaware of the subpoenas, spokesman Jay Carney told
   reporters Monday night.

   "We are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal
   investigations, as those matters are handled independently by the
   Justice Department," Carney said.

   Holder announced in June 2012 that he had assigned two U.S. attorneys
   to lead investigations into the possible leaking of state secrets, and
   members of Congress have complained about disclosures of electronic
   warfare campaigns against Iran, U.S. drone attacks overseas and Obama's
   personal involvement in "kill lists" of militants in Yemen and
   Pakistan.

   But Pruitt wrote that most of the records collected from the AP "can
   have no plausible connection to any ongoing investigation," and the
   American Civil Liberties Union called on the Justice Department to
   explain its actions.

   "Obtaining a broad range of telephone records in order to ferret out a
   government leaker is an unacceptable abuse of power," Ben Wizner, the
   head of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a
   written statement. "Freedom of the press is a pillar of our democracy,
   and that freedom often depends on confidential communications between
   reporters and their sources."

   In a statement issued Monday night, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
   Patrick Leahy said, "I am very troubled by these allegations and want
   to hear the government's explanation."

   "The burden is always on the government when they go after private
   information -- especially information regarding the press or its
   confidential sources," said Leahy, D-Vermont. "I want to know more
   about this case, but on the face of it, I am concerned that the
   government may not have met that burden."

   And Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, told CNN that the Justice
   Department already has the ability "to listen, very transparently, to
   all the government phones and government activities."

   "You can imagine if Congress wanted to know about leaks that obviously
   came out of the administration that ended up in the press, they would
   be outraged if we tried to get that information," said Issa, a member
   of the House Judiciary Committee and a leading critic of Holder. "But
   that's exactly what they're doing. They're looking at what is
   considered to be confidential."
