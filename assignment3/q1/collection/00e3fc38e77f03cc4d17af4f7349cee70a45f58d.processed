[22]Idaho GOP mulls plan to have candidates chosen by Central Committee

   We haven't heard from Idaho Republicans in a bit, let's see [29]what
   those fine fellows are up to:

     Republicans aiming to run for governor, the Idaho Legislature or
     even county coroner may first have to win approval from GOP leaders,
     according to a proposed internal party rule change that's arisen
     following the 2013 Legislature's hotly-debated vote for a
     state-based insurance exchange.

     Numerous other rule changes are also on the docket, including a
     proposal to single out GOP lawmakers for voting in a way that
     "contradicts the Republican ideals." They could be punished with
     withdrawal of financial support, according to that proposal.

   Hmm. I see the purge of potential moderates continues be a defining
   party ideal.

   At issue appears to be Gov. Butch Otter (R-BestNameEver)'s push for a
   state insurance exchange, i.e. that he caved into the cruel Obamacare
   plot that all true patriots know is the worstest thing to ever happen
   to America. That battle pitted Republican against Republican in ways
   that made hardline Republicans very sad, and the hardliners are peeved
   enough about that they're looking to pass new rules saying that from
   now on, the hardliners are in charge and you can't even run as a
   Republican unless the state GOP's Central Committee (no, that's the
   actual name) approves of your candidacy first.

   Surprisingly, even some Republicans take issue with the thought of the
   Central Committee deciding who the party's candidates will be, so it's
   not clear how many of the pondered party-pooper proposals will properly
   prosper. We'll find out after the Committee meets to consider them this
   weekend.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [41]Tagging tips - [42]Search For Tags - [43]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [44]Civil
   Rights, [45]Community, [46]Congress, [47]Culture, [48]Economy,
   [49]Education, [50]Elections, [51]Energy, [52]Environment, [53]Health
   Care, [54]International, [55]Labor, [56]Law, [57]Media, [58]Meta,
   [59]National Security, [60]Science, [61]Transportation, or [62]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([63]California, [64]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   I imagined the "Central Committee" exercised its awesome powers to tone
   DOWN the crazy.  You know, pick candidates a little more electable
   than those likely to be preferred by Republican primary voters.

   But I'm sure Hunter's right, as always, and remoreseless purge of
   suspected moderates is a far more likely outcome.

       but in Idaho, it's the voters who tone down the committees. Here in
       Bonneville County, we have some of the most senior members of the
       State Senate, and one in particular, Bart Davis, has caught hell
       from the teabaggers and the wing nuts, but he's well known and
       popular with the voters.
       Any challenger will play hell trying to win over Bart, and I'm sure
       he's one of the biggest targets, as he never got an endorsement
       from the Bonneville County Repub CC in 2012.
       Several of the farthest right wingers who had risen to state
       prominence lost in the primaries. The only way left for them is to
       try a coup, but I doubt the voters will stand for it.
       What I'm seeing is an accelerating civil war in the state GOP. The
       last time this happened, it pissed the voters off so much they
       voted Democratic and threw out the Gov., Lt. Gov. Attorney General,
       Treasurer, and elected a Democrat to Congress. Cecil Andrus won his
       1st term at that time, and went on to win the Governor's office 4
       more times, even though he went to D.C. for 4 years as Carter's
       Sec. of Interior.
       Right many are called, and damn few are chosen.

   all political parties in California have central committees.
   Generally, elected party officials are members (i.e., governor,
   representatives, etc.) as well as people who are elected by the county
   central committees to be part of the state central committee.  First
   time I heard about central committees, I thought of a lot of Soviet
   jokes.

       One of Idaho's problems is it has really a lot of counties. Many
       more than it should, as many of them have small populations.
       Each has a Central Committee. In many, few folks want to run for
       any position, mostly because the pay is low for the time required,
       and in the farm counties, farmers can't leave their farms for very
       long.
       So the same few people run and win, time after time. Finding GOP
       candidates is a tough job in them, and finding Dem opposition is
       impossible.
       Right many are called, and damn few are chosen.

 "freedom is slavery" ([391]0+ / 0-)
       Or is it "slavery is freedom"?
       I always forget...
       Either way, obviously, you're only "free" to do what's right.
       Clearly, doing wrong can't be defined as "freedom."
       It all makes perfect sense...
       .
       Funny thing is, to people brought up in certain religious
       traditions, it actually does make sense.
       It's enough to make Dawkins' claim that a religious upbringing
       amounts to child abuse seem temptingly plausible.

   have been trying to control the Idaho GOP for almost a decade now.
   When none of their candidates made it past the primaries, first they
   took over several of the largest local Central Committees in the state
   and used their seats as a hopeful legitimizer and a way to boost their
   public presence.

   That didn't work, either, so next they began 'officially' endorsing
   their guys in the primaries, and that didn't work.

   Then they closed the primaries. All they got were Democrats and
   Independents registering as Republicans so they could have a choice, as
   most candidates are Repub and the primaries decide most local contests.
   That didn't work, either. 2012 saw almost all of the far-right
   candidates defeated in favor of moderates.

   So this is their last controlling tactic. It's going to be fun watching
   my own county's RCC- after the last election, all the hard right
   committee members, which was most of the committee, were either voted
   out or resigned. Their replacements, however, are only marginally more
   moderate.

   Right many are called, and damn few are chosen.
