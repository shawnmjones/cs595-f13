   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [41]Tagging tips - [42]Search For Tags - [43]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [44]Civil
   Rights, [45]Community, [46]Congress, [47]Culture, [48]Economy,
   [49]Education, [50]Elections, [51]Energy, [52]Environment, [53]Health
   Care, [54]International, [55]Labor, [56]Law, [57]Media, [58]Meta,
   [59]National Security, [60]Science, [61]Transportation, or [62]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([63]California, [64]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Ivan Sutherland, who first at MIT in 1963, and then later at the
       Univ. of Utah, basically invented the light-pen-sensitive touch
       screen, for air traffic controllers.

 Not Exactly ([81]0+ / 0-)

     the light-pen-sensitive touch screen
       Actually the screen wasn't sensitive to anything, touch or the
       light pen. The light pen was sensitive to the light produced by the
       screen, when the electron gun in the CRT lit up the phosphors. You
       had to display a little tracking cursor around the pen's last known
       location so that you could track its movement.  Pen tracking was
       relatively easy on a raster display, a bit more difficult on a
       vector display; I've written both kinds.
       Look at the Wikipedia article on "light pen," if nothing else than
       because the cute young thing shown using one is now my wife, and
       she's using the Hypertext system we built. [82](Wiki)
       I've always heard the invention of the light pen as being credited
       to Doug Ross of MIT and SofTech, not Sutherland.  I heard that both
       from Doug himself, my boss at SofTech, and my boss at MITRE, one of
       the principles on the SAGE air defense system that used Whirlwind.
       (Doug basically invented the field of CAD/CAM.)

   Silicon Valley Watcher: [141]The Shocking Truth About Doug Engelbart:
   Silicon Valley's Sidelined Genius

     Tributes to the genius of computer pioneer Doug Engelbart are
     flooding the web following the announcement of his death at the age
     of 88. Yet in the final four decades of his life no one would fund
     him and he felt he had wasted the last years of his life.

     [...]

     Despite all the accolades and testaments to his genius, Silicon
     Valley largely ignored him and he spent decades trying to find
     funding for his ideas, and even someone just to listen to him.

     [...]

     Think of how far we could have come in terms of collaborative apps,
     augmented systems and more, if we hadn't had to spend more than two
     decades reinventing what we already had.

     Think of what else Doug Engelbart could have contributed if he had
     funding in the last 35 years of his life.

     In 2005, Mr Engelbart confided to me: "I sometimes feel that my work
     over the past 20 or so years has been a failure. I have not been
     able to get funding and I have not been able to engage anybody in a
     dialogue."

     CNBC Host Loses It: Climate Science Is A `Bona Fide Cult'

     On Friday, CNBC anchor Joe Kernen described climate science as a
     "bona fide cult" of "enviro socialists" in an interview with the
     former CEO of Shell Oil.

     Kernen and his guest John Hofmeister laughed off the consequences of
     climate change and casually dismissed President Obama's call for
     action:
      KERNEN: John, you know, better just set your alarm clock for three
     years from now. You're not going to get a speech about natural gas
     and energy independence. You got a climate change speech. That's
     what you got and a big one.

     HOFMEISTER: That's what I call foolishness. We're not dealing with
     the real problems. Let's face climate change over time.

     KERNEN: That's easy for you to say. You don't have a house on the
     coast that will get swept in to -- New York is going to be under 32
     feet of water, Hofmeister, you better get with the program.
     [laughter]

   [151]http://en.wikipedia.org/...

     Joe Kernen (born January 6, 1956) is a CNBC news anchor. He is
     currently co-host of CNBC's Squawk Box. His nickname is "The
     Kahuna".[1]

     Kernen came to CNBC in the 1991 merger with Financial News Network,
     having joined FNN after a 10-year career as a stockbroker.

     Kernen grew up in the Western Hills section of Cincinnati and
     graduated from St. Xavier High School in 1974.[2] He holds a
     bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado and a master's
     degree in molecular biology from the Massachusetts Institute of
     Technology, where he worked on cancer research.

       from lack of intelligence, necessarily.  Surely you've seen that
       with people in your own life.
       Denial can come from feeling threatened by the new information,
       from the fact that you'd have to change fundamental beliefs you
       aren't willing to let go of, and other causes.  Including, in the
       case of oil executives and such, the simple fact that you're making
       huge amounts of money and don't intend to admit the reality of
       anything that would change that.
       Don't know what this particular guy's problem is, but he shouldn't
       be running around disguised as a journalist.

 Old Iron ([200]0+ / 0-)
       That was the justification in my college, where the comp sci dept
       had both real-time computing and batch programming in all its glory
       (punch cards, paper tape, magnetic tape).  There was a huge
       infrastructure of such machinery in government and industry, plus
       that even for large programs in an RTC environment, it was often
       stored on magnetic tape for batch programming, turning those cool
       workstations into glorified data entry points.  Remember the size
       and cost of hard drives?  Yipe!
       But for smaller programs, especially in APL, it was a blast to
       build them and watch them run right in front of you!  Then, of
       course, after your time at the workstation was up, you'd trudge
       over to the punch card machines for your mandatory pounding of the
       chads, and hope you didn't drop your vast stack and get them out of
       sequence.
       Gods, I sound like an old SNL skit.  "We had to do the surgery
       ourselves....and we liked it!"

 An Age of Giants... ([210]0+ / 0-)
       Lots of companies were into building Big Iron (aka Old Iron) back
       in the day.  It's always associated with IBM now, but companies
       like Burroughs, Control Data, DEC, and Sperry built them.  Let's
       not forget Wang Labs.  Huge things.  I actually got a tour of one
       of these installations when I was a little kid.  It was one of the
       last Burroughs mainframes, kept in a big isolated room, glassed in,
       cold as hell in there from the a/c.  Giant printers clacked away
       while magnetic tape machines as tall as a man spun about and disk
       drives the size of washing machines hummed to themselves.  The
       disks for these disk drives were removable, the size of large
       dinner plates sealed in plastic half-domes.
       All that commotion and forty years later, the little midtower
       sitting next to my knee has about six orders of magnitude more
       computing power than that behemoth.

       that first iMac mouse that was perfectly round, so you couldn't
       tell when it was upright.

   I started in 1981, and we were the FIRST year to start using terminals,
   and a mainframe.

   Never even touched a card.

   They called the terminals "widgets"

 Will dKos be getting a snark detector? ([247]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [248]Rich in PA, [249]LordMike, [250]rbird

   The BBC [251]reports:

     French company Spotter has developed an analytics tool that claims
     to be able to identify sarcastic comments posted online.

   Oh, that got my attention!

     Its proprietary software uses a combination of linguistics,
     semantics and heuristics to create algorithms that generate reports
     about online reputation. It says it is able to identify sentiment
     with up to an 80% accuracy rate.

   Such as?

     "One of our clients is Air France. If someone has a delayed flight,
     they will tweet, 'Thanks Air France for getting us into London two
     hours late' - obviously they are not actually thanking them," he
     said.

   Apparently this new tool works on 29 different languages. Officially,
   it detects sarcasm. Of course, around dKos, this could easily be used
   as a snark detector. The fee to use the tool/service starts at £1,000
   per month

   Makes you wonder what percentage of comments it would flag.......

   Marry the one you love, not the one a bigot says you're allowed to
   love.

 What could possibly go wrong... ([254]0+ / 0-)
       It is hard enough as it is to tell when someone is joking when
       online.
       But then again, I am having trouble figuring out who would pay
       £1,000 for an automated tool to do this.  Then again, maybe the
       news report itself was snark.
