   Is the use of chemicals a "red line"? Should the West intervene?

   (CNN) -- Declaring himself "war-weary" but determined to hold Syria
   accountable for using banned chemical weapons, President Barack Obama
   said Friday he was considering a limited response to what U.S.
   intelligence assessed with "high confidence" as a Syrian attack that
   killed more than 1,400 people.

   Obama told reporters he had yet to make a final decision, but hinted at
   a military strike that sources and experts say would entail cruise
   missiles fired from U.S. Navy ships at Syrian command targets -- but
   not at any chemical weapons stockpiles.

   "It is not in the national security interests of the United States to
   ignore clear violations" of what he called an "international norm"
   banning the use of chemical weapons, Obama said at a meeting with
   visiting heads of Baltic nations Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

   He called the Syrian attack a "challenge to the world" that threatens
   U.S. allies Israel, Turkey and Jordan while increasing the risk of such
   weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.

   President Bashar al-Assad's government has claimed that jihadists
   fighting with the rebels carried out the chemical weapons attacks on
   August 21 to turn global sentiments against it, a claim dismissed by
   Obama and others who say there is no evidence to support that claim.

   [42]Why Russia, Iran and China are standing by al-Assad

   Earlier, Secretary of State John Kerry released details of a
   declassified U.S. intelligence report in an effort to muster support at
   home and abroad for a military response against al-Assad's government.

   Obama's preference

   However, NATO allies want the United Nations to authorize any military
   response, something that both Kerry and Obama said was unlikely because
   of opposition by permanent Security Council member Russia, a Syrian
   ally.
   The U.N. Security Council votes to approve a resolution that will
   require Syria to give up its chemical weapons during a meeting on
   Friday, September 27, at the United Nations. The vote comes after
   assertions by the United States and other Western nations that the
   Syrian government used chemical weapons in an August 21 attack outside
   Damascus that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people. The U.N.

   attack in Syria
   White House, lawmakers huddle on Syria
   'We have to do something' about Syria
   What steps will the U.S. take in Syria?

   "My preference would have been that the international community already
   would have acted," Obama said, citing "the inability of the Security
   Council to move in the face of a clear violation of international
   norms."

   He expressed frustration with the lack of international support, saying
   that "a lot of people think something should be done, but nobody seems
   willing to do it."

   "It's important for us to recognize that when over 1,000 people are
   killed, including hundreds of innocent children, through the use of a
   weapon that 98 or 99 percent of humanity says should not be used even
   in war, and there is no action, then we're sending a signal that that
   international norm doesn't mean much," Obama said. "And that is a
   danger to our national security."

   Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Lukashevich dismissed the threats by
   the United States as "unacceptable."

   "Washington's statements threatening to apply force to Syria are
   unacceptable," Lukashevich said in a statement posted on the ministry's
   website. He added that United Nations weapons inspectors are still
   investigating and "without any proof we are hearing threats of striking
   Syria."

   "Even U.S. allies have called for 'taking a break' to wait for the U.N.
   experts to complete their work in order to get an objective picture of
   what happened there," he said.

   Rising resistance

   The remarks by Obama and Kerry, and the release of the intelligence
   report, came as Obama's administration faced rising resistance to a
   military strike against the Syrian government both at home and abroad.

   Britain's Parliament voted against joining a coalition sought by Obama
   to respond militarily, denying the president a key NATO ally that has
   steadfastly supported previous campaigns.

   In Washington, questions about the veracity of the U.S. intelligence
   and whether the nation is headed for another long war based on false
   information -- like happened in Iraq -- have emerged from both parties
   in Congress.

   "I assure you nobody ends up being more war-weary than me," Obama said,
   adding that he was not considering any option that would entail "boots
   on the ground" or a long-term campaign.

   Instead, Obama said, he and his top military and security aides were
   looking at a "limited, narrow act" to ensure that Syria and others know
   the United States and its allies won't tolerate future similar future
   violations.

   For almost two years, Obama has avoided direct military involvement in
   Syria's civil war, only escalating aid to rebel fighters in June after
   suspected smaller-scale chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government
   forces.

   However, last week's attack obliterated the "red line" Obama set just
   over a year ago against the use of Syria's chemical weapons stocks.

   Veteran Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of
   South Carolina challenged Obama's plan Friday, issuing a statement that
   said the purpose of any U.S. military action in Syria "should not be to
   help the president save face."

   The goal, they said, "should be to shift the balance of power on the
   battlefield against Assad and his forces."

   Kerry: "We will not repeat" Iraq

   Earlier, Kerry insisted that the situation differs from Iraq, saying
   the intelligence community "reviewed and re-reviewed" its information
   "more than mindful of the Iraq experience." And he added: "We will not
   repeat that moment."

   [43]Map: U.S. and allied assets around Syria

   He cited particular evidence that he insisted shows al-Assad's regime
   was responsible.

   "We know that for three days before the attack, the Syrian regime's
   chemical weapons personnel were on the ground in the area, making
   preparations," Kerry said. "And we know that the Syrian regime elements
   were told to prepare for the attack by putting on gas masks and taking
   precautions associated with chemical weapons."

   Additionally, the intelligence shows the day, time and location of the
   rockets that were launched and where and when they landed.

   "We know rockets came only from regime-controlled areas and went only
   to opposition-controlled or contested neighborhoods," he said.

   Quoting from the U.S. assessment, Kerry said the attack killed 1,429
   people, including more than 400 children.

   On Friday, the Syrian government called the U.S. intelligence
   information "old tales" based on "fabrications and lies."

   'We are not alone'

   Citing support from the Arab League, Turkey and France, Kerry said, "We
   are not alone in our will to do something" in response to the attack.
   He brushed off the British Parliament vote against joining a military
   invention, saying that the United States "makes our own decisions on
   our own timelines, based on our values and our interests" in deciding
   the proper course of action.

   [44]Read the full assessment

   Meanwhile, the U.N. mission investigating the suspected chemical
   weapons attack in Syria has completed its collection of samples, said
   Martin Nesirky, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

   Nesirky told reporters that inspectors visited a government military
   hospital in Damascus and the last of them will leave Syria on Saturday.

   Ban will get a briefing Saturday from the inspectors, but a Western
   diplomat told CNN that the secretary-general would likely wait to meet
   again with the Security Council until a final report with laboratory
   analysis is completed, which could take a week.

   Even as the U.N. inspection was winding down, opposition activists said
   Friday there is evidence of another deadly assault in Syria involving
   an incendiary agent. Seven people died and dozens were injured Monday
   in the attack on a school in northern Syria.

   So far, opposition by Russia to any military response has scuttled U.N.
   action, and Kerry expressed little hope for a breakthrough.

   "Because of the guaranteed Russian obstructionism of any action through
   the U.N. Security Council, the U.N. cannot galvanize the world to act
   as it should," he said.

   Later Friday, Obama spoke by phone with French President Francois
   Hollande and British Prime Minister David Cameron. White House
   statements said in both calls, the leaders agreed the Syrian violation
   of chemical weapons bans cannot be tolerated, but only the statement on
   the call with Hollande said they agreed the Syrian regime must be held
   accountable.

   While the British vote was a blow to Obama's hopes of getting strong
   support from key NATO allies and some Arab League states, regional NATO
   ally Turkey on Friday backed the U.S. contention that al-Assad's regime
   was responsible for the chemical attack.

   "The information at hand indicates that the opposition does not have
   these types of sophisticated weapons," said Foreign Minister Ahmet
   Davutoglu. "From our perspective, there is no doubt that the regime is
   responsible."

   Australia also weighed in, with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd saying the
   evidence against al-Assad was overwhelming and, "therefore, the focus
   now legitimately lies on the most appropriate from of international
   response."

   Rudd said there has been "no request from the United States or any
   other country for a direct or indirect Australian military
   participation" in a possible strike against Syria.

   Alone or together?

   The White House has made clear that the United States will respond in
   some form to the use of chemical weapons. Previously, it ruled out U.S.
   troops on the ground or imposing a no-fly zone.

   Sources have indicated a campaign of limited strikes by cruise missiles
   fired from U.S. naval ships in the region, targeting military command
   centers but not chemical weapons stockpiles, is the likely option.

   The British Parliament vote and demands by other key European allies,
   including France and Germany, to put off a decision until after the
   U.N. inspectors report on what happened in Syria have slowed the
   response time.

   Hollande told Le Monde newspaper that intervention should be limited
   and not be directed toward al-Assad's overthrow, a position also
   expressed by Obama.

   Also Friday, former President Jimmy Carter, said "a punitive military
   response without a U.N. Security Council mandate or broad support from
   NATO and the Arab League would be illegal under international law and
   unlikely to alter the course of the war."

   Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has repeatedly said the United States
   will respond to Syria in concert with allies.

   "Our approach is to continue to find an international coalition that
   will act together," he told journalists Friday in Manila, Philippines.

   Public opinion

   Skeptics of military action have pointed at the decision to use force
   in Iraq, when the United States government under Bush marched to war
   based on a thin claim that dictator Saddam Hussein was harboring
   weapons of mass destruction.

   Opponents are conjuring up a possible repeat of that scenario in Syria,
   though the intelligence being gathered on the use of WMDs in Syria may
   be more sound.

   An NBC News poll conducted Wednesday and Thursday indicated that 50% of
   the public says the United States should not take military action
   against Damascus in response to the Syrian government's alleged use of
   chemical weapons against its own citizens, with 42% saying military
   action would be appropriate.

   But the survey suggested that if military action would be confined to
   air strikes using cruise missiles, support rises.

   More than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama's fellow Democrats,
   signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a "full debate"
   before any U.S. action.

   CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Barbara Starr, Lesa Jansen, Ben Brumfield,
   Elise Labott, Nick Paton Walsh, Jim Acosta, Max Foster and Bharati Naik
