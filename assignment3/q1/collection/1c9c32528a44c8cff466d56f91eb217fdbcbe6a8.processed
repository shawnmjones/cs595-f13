[24]Chief Blue Dog Mike Ross enters Arkansas governor race

   Mike Ross announces campaign for Arkansas governor.
   Can't you feel the excitement from Mike Ross's (D-Villain) campaign
   announcement?
   If you didn't appreciate what the Blue Dogs did to the Democratic Party
   and the nation, then the Arkansas Democratic gubernatorial primary is
   about to get interesting.

   Former Lt. Gov. and economic populist Bill Halter is already in the
   race, and today, Rep. Mike Ross [30]joined him. Those of you with good
   memories might remember Ross as a former chairman of the Blue Dog
   caucus in the House, proud to undermine Democratic initiatives wherever
   they might arise.

   Of course, Ross has to get through a statewide Democratic primary, so
   queue the revisionism:

     Here lately, it seems the only time Arkansas makes national news is
     when these divisive politicians succeed at pushing through their
     attacks on women and families. Attacks like these only serve to
     erase the progress Arkansas has made and they detract from our focus
     on the future.

   Cute. This is the same Mike Ross who joined Reps. Paul Ryan, Steve
   King, Allen West, Michele Bachmann and Todd Akin [31]co-sponsoring the
   "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act"--the very bill that tried to
   [32]redefine rape between "forcible" and, well, the other kinds of rape
   that are okay, I guess. I just don't understand how Republicans (and
   Mike Ross) think.

   This is also the same Mike Ross who voted for GOP efforts to [33]defund
   Planned Parenthood.

     The House also approved an amendment offered by Pence to the
     spending bill that cuts all forms of federal funding for Planned
     Parenthood, which operates a network of more than 800 family
     planning clinics nationwide. Planned Parenthood receives roughly
     $360 million in federal assistance annually through Medicaid,
     Maternal and Child Health block grants and other sources.

   With Democrats like Mike Ross, who needs Republicans? Seriously, the
   dude voted against Obamacare, he voted to extend Bush's tax cuts for
   millionaires. He was the [34]only Democrat to receive Koch Brother
   money, and has been their favorite Democrat [35]for years.

   There is no place in the Democratic Party for Democrat-hating Blue Dogs
   like Ross. This race will matter, not just for the people of Arkansas
   who deserve far better, but for what we stand for as a party, even in
   the South. We'll be watching this race very, very closely.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       the importance of women in a Democratic primary, I don't think
       this'll be an issue.
       Problem, of course, is that Arkansas as a whole is one of the most
       socially conservative states in the union. It is dead-last in
       support for marriage equality. So Halter can't make the entire
       primary about this. But I don't doubt it'll play a major role.

   He could not beat Lincoln among Dems only even with a lot of help from
   unions.

   This race simply does not excite me.  I lack the money to contribute to
   anyone there.   Yes, nice to punish Ross, but it is nicer to elect
   progressives who go to Washington.  I have to pick and choose
   carefully.  Arkansans can do what they want.

       Hard for me to see the connection here.
       There are legitimate reasons to criticize some of Obama's policy
       choices and tactics, but to elevate him into the "evil one" who has
       subverted all Dems and is causing blue dogs to spontaneously appear
       from hell is rather silly.

       His enthusiastic embrace of and reference to Republican policies
       seems to be sending a bad message to blue dogs. It's just a
       complaintive comment lamenting the absence of robust
       democrattiness.
       The last thing we need is more of that crap. Obama is far from the

        If you recall, Ross opoosed almost everything Obama did.
       My point is that blaming Obama for things like this cheapens
       critiques of bad policies.  You look as if you blame everything on
       him.

   The President has a lot of personal likeability going for him,
   otherwise many of his more right-leaning policy decisions would be
   doing even more poorly than they already are with the electorate.

   Even though all the polls say voters want politicians to 'compromise',
   it's because they want things to get done that benefit them and the
   country, not because they simply want 'compromise' for its own sake.
   Not every compromise is good.

       being too chummy with the right wing.
       You, yourself, sir, have posted front page articles essentially
       saying similar things with regards to the whole Chained CPI thing.
       Obama championing a republican policy, citing repubs when defending
       his decision to do so.
       it is just a flippant comment about the Head Democrat setting a bad
       example as well as reiterating my longstanding disdain for the blue
       dog: we suffer with more than enough wingnuttiness without half the
       democratic party being essential republicans as well.
       REPHRASED for pallatibility: Obama's ongoing focus on chummying up
       with the GOP sends a message that chummying up to the GOP is a good
       thing.

 I seriously don't know the direction of this blog ([323]0+ / 0-)

   anymore. A growing number here detest anything Obama has done
   (including Obamacare), and probably see no difference between Ross and
   Obama in the first place. Kos apparently still does. To many here Obama
   himself is a Blue Dog Democrat and even a "fullblown conservative."
   Many here who HATE Blue Dogs would have voted down Obamacare too
   (albeit for a different reason). There seems to be a general "parting
   of the ways" and "splinter groups" going in every direction. "To elect
   Democrats" is unreal and too simplistic these days. Definitions and
   more sharpening of perspective, please!

   Sometime soon I'd like to see the "real" demographics here (not age,
   sex, ethnic heritage, income, etc. etc.):But who is still with most of
   what Obama does (I hate tampering with SS and the idea of passing the
   Pipeline through among others) but am still on Obama's side in general
   for many reasons) and who are past ready to "renounce" him and build a
   "real" progressive coalition, etc. Also, to identify roughly at what
   point on the political spectrum the various groups and individuals here
   sit. I'm very curious at the "present condition" of our readership.
   What is the general attitude toward what most Democrats are doing
   vis-a-vis the Republicans?

   (On a humorous note, remember Mort Sahl's old blackboard political
   spectrum as part of his routine? This goes WAY back. He'd start on the
   left with the "Albanian Communists" of the time, who were to the left
   of the most revolutionary elements in Mao's Red Army. To the extreme
   right were the Fascists, of course. He did change this assessment over
   time for humorous purposes.)

   Heck, AK dem Senator Pryor, while he voted for Obama care, voted

   in support to ban partial birth abortions.

   If he gets the nomination, Dems will support him even if they have to

 Halter will struggle ([357]0+ / 0-)

   in the Dem Primary, because too many of his supporters sabotaged the
   Party in the 2010 General.   The result?.....US Senator John Boozman,
   the #22 most conservative Senator, according to the National Journal.
   Organized labor in some counties have continued, into the present,  to
   make war with those Democrats who voted for Blanche Lincoln in the
   general.  Halter made a late, back door endorsement of the Dem ticket
   in 2010.  And he made public expressions of disapproval to those state
   committee members who did not give him standing applause, when
   introduced at a meeting.  Halter's claim of a $1 million fundraising
   effort in the 1st Qtr are a joke, when one inspects the disclosure
   reports.   Halter's own loan of $640,000 to the campaign in addition to
   out-of-state donors who maxed out to him through the general leaves him
   with a paltry total of instate individual donations.   Many women will
   not forget the Halter camp's role in defeating a sitting female Blue
   Dog, in favor of a lap dog for Mitch McConnell.   To be sure, some
   blogs are yet to realize the folly of that.

       He didn't run for re-election, and we got the wingnut

       couldn't say no.
       What happened is that the party favorite, Attorney General Dustin

 Ross was my congressman ([400]0+ / 0-)

   Right after I moved into his district, I vowed to never vote for him.
   There was a photo in the local paper of Ross speaking at a local high
   school, and then autographing a student's copy of the Constitution.
   Three days earlier, he had voted for the Military Commissions Act,
   which eviscerated the 4th Amendment.

   I've talked with Ross and his staff at several townhalls, meetings at
   his office, telephone townhalls, etc. His disdain for
   progressive/Democratic talking points in palpable. Lots of eye-rolling,
   smirking, frowning, etc. He is much more at ease with teabaggers,
   though of course they turned on him too.

   Halter is a great candidate, but the state Democratic Party hates him
   and will be 100% behind Ross. Bill Clinton probably will be too,
   because he and Ross are old friends. (Ross was Clinton's driver and
   sidekick in his early gubernatorial campaigns.)

   Ross will swing a little left for the primary, but I don't expect it to
   last. He's an opportunist and will say anything if it's popular.
