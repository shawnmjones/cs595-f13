   It took three tries, but state Rep. Steve Vaillancourt, R-Manchester,
   offered both Speaker of the House William O'Brien, R-Mont Vernon, and
   the representatives of the House an apology.

   "As I was saying before, I cannot apologize for anything I did not do,"
   Vaillancourt said. "But I do apologize for using two German words,
   which I understand has negative ramifications when three Latin words
   would have been better. I will never use a German word again."

   As Vaillancourt received a smattering of applause and returned to his
   seat, the committee huddled with O'Brien and determined that the
   apology wasn't acceptable.

   After some back and forth, with O'Brien stating to Vaillancourt that
   there were members in Representatives Hall that had family members who
   were victims of the Holocaust and had fought in World War II,
   Vaillancourt made another statement that the speaker did not believe
   was a direct apology.

   O'Brien then demanded a direct apology from Vaillancourt and he made
   it.

   The original story is below.

   The Statehouse earlier today after a Manchester Republican used a Nazi
   chant to Speaker William OâBrien when responding to what he believed
   were autocratic parliamentary moves on the voter ID bill.

   State Rep. Steve Vaillancourt, R-Manchester, blurted out the âSieg
   Heilâ after the end of a challenge to the speakerâs procedural moves
   from the floor.

   Vaillancourt rose to apologize but was reportedly shut down by OâBrien
   when he did not immediately apologize. O'Brien then attempted to have
   Vaillancourt removed from Representatives Hall by the sergeant at arms
   and later, the New Hampshire State Police.

   Vaillancourt, however, refused to budge from his seat, and stayed
   through the rest of the session and into the recess.

   After the House went into recess, OâBrien put together a committee to
   resolve the matter. At the speakerâs dais, OâBrien met with Rep. Shawn
   Jasper, R-Mancheseter, state Rep. David Hess, R-Hooksett, and Rep.
   David Campbell, D-Nashua, to discuss what to do while Vaillancourt and
   some of his supporters looked on.

   Vaillancourt later left his seat and went downstairs to get some
   coffee.

   Vaillancourt said he wasnât interested in being interviewed after the
   incident but then added, âIâm going to do what I said I was going to do
   â¦ I agreed to apologize for using two vile, inflammatory German words
   when three Latin words would have been more appropriate.â

   Later, two members of the committee met with Vaillancourt in the hall
   of the Statehouse to settle something and Vaillancourt said, âWhat one
   little thing ... I thought we already discussed this.â

   Vaillancourt also challenged the notion that he offered a Nazi salute.

   âThere was no Nazi salute at all,â Vaillancourt said, suggesting that
   he did not offer a Hitler hand motion, only a verbal offering.

   Wikipedia describes âSieg Heilâ as a âNazi saluteâ or âHitler saluteâ
   that means âhail victory.â It was adopted as a way of showing party
   obedience, according to historians.

   According to other representatives at the Statehouse, Vaillancourt has
   agreed to offer an appropriate apology when the House goes back into
   session later today.

   Doesn't being ejected from the house chamber amount to the government
   denying free speech to Rep. Vaillancourt in defiance of the First
   Amendment's guarantee that the government shall not deny that right?

   more proof that O'brien is a bully and a baby, he would not accept the
   apology until it was spoken in exactly the manner he decided if should
   be given! Don't always agree with V'Court, but kudos to him for
   standing his ground!
