What happens next in Michigan

   Training in how to "protest peacefully, get noticed and stay safe" at a
   UAW hall in Dearborn, Michigan, today.

   With [3]sudden support from Republican Governor Rick Snyder,
   Republicans in the Michigan legislature have been speeding through a
   package to severely weaken unions in that state. The pace at which the
   bills are moving through the lame-duck session is almost unbelievable.
   That it's happening in the [4]birthplace of the modern American labor
   union is almost unfathomable.

   The legislature next takes up the so-called Right to Work measures,
   which essentially ban union shops, on Tuesday. Today opponents of Right
   to Work gathered at the UAW hall, picture above, for training in how to
   "[5]protest peacefully and stand together" -- a long tradition in
   Michigan labor. State officials are [6]expecting a crowd of thousands
   next week at the Capitol in Lansing. [7]Eclectablog reports that the
   union supporters will find that conservative groups have already
   reserved the Capitol steps for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, after
   which the chambers adjourn.

   Activists are also making calls from a [8]phone-bank against the bills
   at the AFL/CIO office in Lansing. Meanwhile, a [9]judge has urged state
   police to keep the Capitol building open to protesters if at all
   possible. The closure of the building last Thursday, during the first
   votes, has prompted suits over the state's Open Meetings law.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Right to Work legislation has moved through so quickly that one
   Republican lawmaker voter against it because, he said, "[10]We
   literally weren't given the legislation to read until minutes before
   voting." From experience with Right to Work in other states,
   conservatives and liberals agree that the rule is catastrophic for
   unions, with significant [11]cuts in membership, and [12]lower wages
   and benefits. As [13]Stephen Henderson writes in the Detroit Free
   Press:

     [O]f the 11 states with the fastest-growing economies as measured by
     gross domestic product, only three were right-to-work states in
     2011. (Michigan was on that list in 2011, too, which Snyder spent
     all year this year bragging about. Now, suddenly, he claims our
     economy is being hobbled by an oppressive union environment.)

     As a result, right-to-work states also suffer much worse poverty
     than union states, by several important measures.

     Eight of the 10 states with the lowest overall per-capita incomes
     are right-to-work. And among the states with the highest rates of
     people without medical insurance (a sign of the quality of jobs
     available), seven of 10 are right-to-work. Eight of the 10 states
     with the highest poverty rates are right-to-work.

   If Right to Work, leads to job growth, it appears be because of a
   successful race to the bottom. (H/t [14]Ed Gilgore at Washington
   Monthly, [15]Alec MacGillis at The New Republic.) (And P.S. Michigan
   Republicans have also been racing through [16]new restrictions on
   abortion, [17]sweeping changes to the education that several
   superintendents call undemocratic, and a [18]revised emergency manager
   law, while [19]Detroit talks big layoffs to avoid a state takeover.)

   If the UAW wants to stop the law dead in it's tracks, it needs to have
   it's members simply engage in full blown work stoppages across the
   country until it's repealed. Which would take all of about 20 minutes,
   given the automotive industry pull in Michigan.

   daw55, right to work laws have been around since 1947 when the
   Taft-Hartley act was passed over President Truman's veto. 23 states
   have right-to-work laws which says that a worker where a union bargains
   collectively, does not have to join the union or pay for the cost of
   collective bargaining. 23 states have right to work laws, some even
   have right to work in their state constitution as well. Michigan would
   be 24.

   Ever since Taft-Hartley, companies have been working to reduce the
   power of unions. If you ever listen to Fox News, you will hear the
   companies' argument that the unions are too powerful. That is not true,
   but Fox and others have the microphone. Union membership has gone down
   dramatically over the years to around 7% of the workforce. Right to
   work laws deprive a union of iresources to bargain for its workers
   because a worker can "free-load" and not pay anything to the union.

   So you see, labor has been trying to restore the level playing field
   since 1947 and so far, the companies hold a very strong hand.

   I hope that the next four years will see movement toward leveling the
   playing field and making the collective bargaining a growing part of
   the labor-management equation.

     Union membership has gone down dramatically over the years to around
     7% of the workforce

   To echo Jimes' point a little further...

   According to the BLS no one industry is represented by a majority who
   are unionized. The closest industry is that of education in which
   roughly 47% report being a member of a union. Additionally the BLS
   states that the national average for union membership is 12% and that
   the most unionized state in our country is New York with roughly 25% of
   the state belonging to unions.

   It's amazing to me how these unions can continually effect businesses
   so much (as all these companies claim) when unions do not represent a
   majority in any fashion. Such a tiny minority and yet all these
   companies continually insist that no, no the unions are bankrupting us!
   It's rather fascinating.

   I also want to add that it isn't small businesses like mine who
   routinely complain about unions- ever notice that? It's always big
   companies like Wal Mart who have a problem with unions. Now why might
   that be? Maybe because your local mom and pop shop cares about it's
   employees, but a mega-international-corporation like Wal Mart doesn't.
   Maybe that's why I provide health insurance and a liveable wage to all
   my employees (which I would have done regardless of PPACA and any wage
   laws), but that's why Wal Mart doesn't. Maybe that's why Wal Mart
   pushes it's employees onto food stamps, public housing, and Medicare
   even while they are working full time, but I actually give people a
   salary so they can have a home.

   I know I've ranted about this before, but I'm telling you all: don't
   believe the hype when Republicans talk about small businesses. They
   don't care about us one iota. It's all for the national and
   multi-national companies. They are the "profit" makers who benefit from
   Republican policies at the expense of everybody else.

   Here's a tip, Shooter: not everyone is as much of a tool as you are.
   Some people, many of them very successful business people, manage to
   run their lives WITHOUT slurping the Kochs'... well, you know. They
   also haven't mortgaged their morals away in search for one more
   almighty dollar. I know, it's a shocking concept.

   I wonder if it would blow Shooter's mind to hear that there are lots of
   small business owners who enjoy working with unions and some who even
   prefer working with unions? There are also lots of small business
   owners who allow their employees to take part ownership of the business
   or who allow the employees to primarily run the business. And guess
   what? The majority of these companies are not only vibrant, but they do
   better than their money-to-the-top counterparts.

   But, in general, I'm not going to have a person with a rudimentary
   understanding of economics, who constantly makes statements that
   invalidate other statements that he has made or blatantly contradicts
   other statements that he has made, and a guy who fails on a continual
   basis to present any facts to support any of the arguments he makes
   talk to me about how to run a business or what it takes to run a
   business. Not to be rude, but that is probably why I still have a
   business and this supposed business expert can only talk about his
   "once-upon-a-time" story of business ownership.

   And while you are at least paying attention to the "Right to Work" scam
   being pushed through in Michigan, NO ONE is paying attention to the
   ALEC-sponsored education bills that are being rammed through in the
   same lame duck session. These laws are a nightmare and the national

   public education in Michigan and replace it with corporate for-profit

   Does anyone know what the case law is on the "attach a de minimus
   appropriation to an unrelated law to protect it from the citizenry"
   scheme?

   I would think that as a transparent pretext to circumvent the
   Constitution a court would have found the two parts of the Act
   (unrelated appropriation and body of law) to be separable on the
   grounds that the "no referenda" Constitutional clause otherwise renders
   the provision for referenda moot.

   But I'll admit IANAL. Love to hear it explained, though.

   In Michigan any bill with appropriations attached can not be overturned
   via voter referandum. So they are placing $50,000 on each bill for
   informational brochures, etc. To each bill so the citizens cant get a
   petition to repeal the bills. And BTW - they arent reporting via the
   media this craziness either. Except airing Snyders comment about how he
   will make sure the bills cant be overturned. The media needs to explain

   The right to work bill is finally getting coverage - and alot of it.
   But the other bills they have passed, FEMA (after we voted it down in
   the election), School system changes to allow more charter schools and
   open enrollment to any school, removing insurance coverage in any plan
   for abortion even for risk to mothers health, rape, ancest, fetal
   health - need to make it a seperate rider, allowing health care workers
   (pharmasists to doctors to aides in nursing homes) to refuse treatment
   based on morals. These have gotten almost no ceverage on the local
   news, the right to work bill is overshadowing all the other insane
   bills they passed this week.

   Nice summary of the nightmare passel of bills pending in MI. On the
   education package, people do not know that it will effectively give one
   person appointed by the governor (not elected) access to basically
   unlimited public funds to apportion out to any "school" (charter,
   online or "My Friend Bob's Academy") with NO standards, NO
   accountability, not even answerable to the state Board of Education.
   There is no limit to the amount of money or the number of "schools". So
   this one bill can allow one person to bleed the entire public education
   system to funnel money to anything calling itself a school in an amount
   we can't even know!

   This person can even force a school district to sell buildings (built
   with our tax dollars) that are not being "used" (anybody want to try to
   define "used"?), again with no standards or accountability. In other
   words, a school district can be forced to sell real estate to "My
   Friend Bob's Academy" at a very friendly price! This is absolutely
   INSANE and has ALEC written all over it. Help, Rachel!

   If people do not like working in a union shop, then they can quit and
   get a job in a non-union facility. Nobody forces you to work in a
   union.

   There are only two forms of forced labor in the U.S. that I know of,
   military draft and jury duty and neither one forces you to join a
   union.

   like before he was elected!! Why was he ever elected??? The jerk is
   right off of Wall St. You knew that he didn't care about the little
   person. It will be a long time cleaning up the mess these jerks leave
   and there will be enough right wing religionists in Michigan to ensure
   that these people maintain their positions.

   It is just so frustrating to see in advance what is going to happen and
   people don't pay any attention. This must be what Cassandra felt like.
   It's horrible.

   I absolutely agree with you. Except I would add a little bit of defense
   for some Republicans who voted for this piece of horse*&^%. Snyder's
   campaign was a total con job, and the Democratic nominee for governor
   was a total putz! Snyder ran his campaign to the middle, he portrayed
   himself as an old-fashioned, get the job done, rational Republican: he
   was NOT one of the radical, tea-bagging, right-wing nut jobs. Meanwhile
   the Democratic candidate ran like some union dude right out of the
   1950's. It was awful. Of course I voted for the Dem, but kept firing
   off letters and email to his campaign about how unbelievably STUPID
   they were, for all the good it did me.

   So NOW the problem is that most REPUBLICANS in Michigan have no idea
   exactly what this corrupt legislature and amoral turd of a governor are
   doing! Of course, the brainless tea-baggers hear the buzzwords they
   love and grin stupidly, but that whole group of traditional Republicans
   simply don't know what exactly is happening, because the press is doing
   a perfectly dreadful job of covering it.

   When the superintendents of schools of Bloomfield Hills and Birmingham
   sent home letters about how worried (read terrified) they are about the
   current "education" bills, I can tell you that every single Republican
   parent I talked to was FURIOUS. This was not what they thought they
   were voting for in Snyder. And it is probably more effective that when
   they get the email from Snyder asking for their support, they respond
   that if he doesn't veto these bills they will never vote for another
   Republican in their lives. Unfortunately, I fear it is too little, too
   late.

   Regular voters know what the gop will do if given an opportunity ,
   moderate middle ground voters seem to be clueless about it tho , iowa
   elected a gop gov in 2010 , he ran on improving EDUCATION , we all knew
   what that meant , the 1st thing he did was try and gut education
   funding and ALEC the tax code in a way that would destroy local funding
   for schools

   The people all got up in arms , but these same people , when you tell
   them how important it is to vote in every election , turn glassy eyed
   when the subject comes up , one gop govenor will get them motivated tho
   , but you have to have a sane candidate , FOR SURE !!!

   A great point. It isn't that folks in Michigan should just give up;
   they need to do what they can to at least slow down anti-union and
   anti-middle class legislation. However, those who oppose this need to
   begin organizing RIGHT NOW for the 2014 elections.

   Michigan Democrats need to start mobilizing and directing their
   energies toward finding electable candidates and making plans to
   develop strategies necessary to win the governorship and take control
   of both houses of the Michigan Legislature.

   At that point, they can reverse most or all of these laws, rules, and
   regulations.

   grassroots dissemination of information and a GOTV program seem to be

   Why?? This seems so uncalled for. Michigan has been an example of well
   run cities, a booming middle class, low welfare, minimal corruption,
   managing budgets, and such amazing education statistics... I mean,
   given how deep the state's surplus has been for decades and the low
   average unemployment, this seems so needless....

   It's also interesting to note that Republicans have been in control of
   the Legislature (and, for the past two years, the governorship) there
   during much of the recent decline in the state's fortunes.

   I wonder if the fat cats buying up public assets have thought that --

   someday the voters may send people to the Legislature that will use
   "Public Domain" to forcibly buy them back for less?

   It would serve them right.

   And how about a new net worth tax. Make it 99.9% of all assets over
   $500 million.

   What is sad about people having the right to choose to belong to a
   union or not? I thought this country was all about freedom. Obviously
   people are choosing not to belong, because union membership is not near
   what it used to be. Perhaps there is a reason for that. The right to
   work states are loving it when states keep their union status. Means
   more business and jobs for them. Companies can choose to pay more in
   the right to work states because they know that they will not be held
   hostage by the unions. There is a much more congenial atmosphere. Like
   voters choose, so do workers and more and more workers are choosing not
   to belong to unions. Workers are tired of being fleeced for dues money
   for the unions to support candidates and policies that workers might
   not be interested in supporting. If a person chooses to belong, then
   great and wonderful! Power to them. Like libs want choice for
   abortions, conservatives want right to work. No one is saying you can't
   belong to a union. They aren't taking your choice away.

   Sandy Michigan law is such that votres cannot repeal any appropriations
   legislature. The republicans have slapped an appropriations rider onto
   this so that we can't repeal it.

   I disagree with this law, but I'm not surprised by it. The republican
   controlled states around us have been doing the same, Ohio, Wisconsin,
   Indiana. What outrages me is their willful intent to usurp our
   democratic rights to have a say in this.

   How the hell is this not illegal? The legislative bodies work for US,
   not themselves. It is obvious that the people don't want it, and the
   move during a lame duck session shows the intent of party politics. The
   union members may rise up and commit some violence, and who could blame
   them? Look what happened in Pittsburgh, PA in the 1980's! Are people
   willing to stand by and let that happen again? If Gov. Scott was put in
   the hospital by union members, I wouldn't shed a tear for him. How can
   these GOP bastards do this? They get the legalese out mere minutes
   before a vote and the people are expected to just deal with it? I can
   feel a posse forming - at least there should be one.

   Everyone used to knock Calif but our state legislators (majority Dems)
   put in place new laws to protect woman's reproductive rights. We voters
   also voted to tax the rich higher and increase school money by
   billions. Locally we passed a 150 million bond issue to repair all
   schools and bring them all up to date with new computers. I feel for
   you guys in the GOP controlled states. You have to get hold of the
   Democrats and find out how to organize better and take back your state.
   GOP parents will suffer also with these stupid laws your legislators
   are creating. Just know that others care about how you are suffering.

   And how does CA pay for all of those services? I hope that the rest of
   the nation's taxpayers aren't expected to bail out CA. All of those
   wonderful services cost money that the state doesn't have. CA, like our
   federal government, is broke and chooses not to live within its means.
