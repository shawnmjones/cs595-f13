[22]Poll: GOP losing spending debate

   Goposaur upside down
   Behold [29]the genius that is today's Republican Party:

     For the past several years, congressional Republicans have focused
     relentlessly on a single message: Washington -- led by President
     Obama -- is spending too much money, and it needs to stop.

     But according to new Washington Post-ABC News polling, that
     laser-like focus isn't helping Republicans win the argument over
     federal spending -- with 67 percent of those tested disapproving of
     the "way Republicans in Congress are handling federal spending."

   President Barack Obama isn't doing all that much better, with 52
   percent disapproving of his handling of federal spending, but it's not
   like he's based his entire brand on spending policy. The GOP, on the
   other hand, has spent nearly every minute of the last four years
   talking about nothing but federal spending policy. For them, these
   numbers are a complete disaster.

   Republicans fare worse than Obama among independents, with 64 percent
   of indies disapproving of how Republicans are handling spending
   compared with 53 percent disapproving of how President Obama is
   handling it. But the real problem for Republicans is that their own
   base hates them. Fifty-one percent of GOP voters disapprove of their
   own party's handling of spending while just 44 percent approve. While
   Republicans are stuck with a negative net approval rating with their
   own base, President Obama has a 52-point positive approval rating on
   spending among Democrats.

   Remember, this is not a debate Democrats need to win. This isn't even
   the debate that Democrats should want to have. They should be thrilled
   to be close to the 50 percent mark in approval. For this debate, they'd
   be happy to simply be in the same general neighborhood as Republicans.
   Well, let me correct that. They'd be happy to be in the same general
   neighborhood as Republicans if Republicans weren't getting absolutely
   destroyed.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [44]Civil
   Rights, [45]Community, [46]Congress, [47]Culture, [48]Economy,
   [49]Education, [50]Elections, [51]Energy, [52]Environment, [53]Health
   Care, [54]International, [55]Labor, [56]Law, [57]Media, [58]Meta,
   [59]National Security, [60]Science, [61]Transportation, or [62]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([63]California, [64]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   because a portion of it could disapprove GOP handling of spending
   because they think they still spend too much/give in to Obama/Dems too
   much.

   Similar for Obama numbers, some Dems could disapprove from the left -
   that he's buying into the debt/deficit frame the GOP has pushed in the
   first place when we should be spending not cutting.

   If you're not talking about what billionaire hedgefund bankster Peter
   G. Peterson is up to you're having the wrong conversations.

   farther away from their numbers than the paltry 15 points currently, we

 Err, the GOP lost the House ([217]0+ / 0-)

       People do hate the GOP. People are voting against them. And in

       like crazy.
       The only real exception is unpopulated mountain states and the deep

       Until gerrymandering changes, those are the cards we have to play,
       and last I heard, Boehner is called "Speaker of the House." Obama
       lost ground in his re-election as well--do you care as much about
       that? Of course not, because he still won. People hate the GOP, but
       only by a small percentage more than they hate the Dems. That is
       not good enough. We're closer in deep red states, but we're falling
       behind in what used to be purple or blue states (NC, WV, AR) in
       equal measure.
       It depends what metrics you use, too. If you are looking at social
       issues, sure, we're doing better all over. Economic issues? Not so
       much.

 And working to change it is ([231]0+ / 0-)
       paramount. But it doesn't help spending effort caring or arguing
       about something we can't yet change. I believe that we have to
       assess and interact with the here and now accurately if we want to
       affect the future. Otherwise we risk sounding like the ineffectual
       "head in the clouds" idealists we are painted as being. (Note that
       this is not the same thing as calling for compromises because it's
       all we can do, because I don't believe that they are all we can do.
       But as long as elections are this close, we have far more work to
       do than we have done yet to persuade others that Dems have good
       answers and are worth electing.)

 And they got the gerrymandering how? ([235]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [236]helfenburg

   By kicking our ass in the 2010 elections. The damage they have done
   since, and continue to do is appalling. It will take years to rebuild
   what we have lost in Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin. And a few cycles to
   overcome the gerrymandering and retake the House.

   What was more important: Obama winning Michigan and Wisconsin or not
   winning the legislature in Michigan and Ohio? I am damn glad Obama won
   Michigan, but right-to-work there makes me vomit. Repeatedly.

   Until we regain the legislatures and governorships, and get the US
   House back, we are screwed.

       And...folks just don't see voting as useful.  I came from a small
       town of over 32K in Illinois (blue state).  But the state had to
       take over the school district, we don't even have a grocery store,
       businesses are fleeing like crazy, we've been on CNN for corruption
       & police brutality.  Everyone hates the mayor and sees him as
       corrupt yet only 1000 people showed up to vote last night in the
       primary.  Dems always run unopposed in the General.  This mayor
       will retain his seat with only 417 people having voted for him out
       of more than 32K citizens. THAT is a damn shame & disgrace.
       Somehow we've got to motivate people that voting (especially local
       voting) has a direct impact on their lives.

       There is no evidence that Bloomberg is using the gun issue to get

       and he has supported candidates for that issue.
       There is also no evidence that Robin Kelly is going to go rogue on

       trusted Jackson.

   Obviously the Reps can make a deal with each other(?!?!) to restore
   defense spending to the stratosphere (in case the 15,000 lightly armed
   Islamist scumbags worldwide march on Omaha). Obama has to hold the line
   elsewhere. A billion out of the DOD budget is a rounding error. A
   billion out of WIC or foodstamps is (more) starving kids.

   Obama won't do it, and I for one have to grant that his prevent defense
   got him reelected after the sell outs of HCR and the disaster of 2010,
   but others - besides bloggers - have to make the point that, for the
   Republicans, starving poor kids isn't a bug, it's a feature, especially
   if they're ... cough ... urban. It comes along with the whole
   libertarian [DEL: pose :DEL] ideology.

   I'd like to think there's a Senator out there (paging Gillibrand) who
   will shut the Senate down if a deal gets struck to trash PBS, WIC,
   HeadStart etc to save a couple billion in the name of bi-partisanship.
   We can fight them to a standstill for the next two years and run at
   them in 2014. We might even start getting the DOD budget rolled back
   to, say, 1999 levels. What it was before a couple guys with box cutters

 The question is why Republicans are mad ([329]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [330]MPociask

   at their own party's handling of spending.

   My guess is that they feel the party isn't cutting spending enough and
   that they're being too weak in opposing President Obama.  Plus they're
   still hopping mad about the revenue increases that Repubs agreed to in
   the fiscal cliff deal.

   If that's the case, then it's safe to venture that giving in to the
   President on revenues will only bring down the party's numbers even
   further among rank and file Repubs.  Therefore I don't see how Repubs,
   at least the ones in safe districts, have any incentive to compromise
   on revenues.

   The problem here, in other words, is the Republican base itself.
   Making the problem worse is gerrymandering that has made most
   Republicans in Congress immune from punishment at the hands of anyone
   other than their mostly Republican constituents.

   And furthermore we have a mainstream political press that refuses to
   point this fact out, choosing instead to continue blaming both sides in
   order to maintain the veneer of "impartiality".

       We are losing this battle, but not for the reason you think.
       Dems have the better story and better messaging on sequester.
       President Obama is doing exactly what I think is appropriate in the
       position he is in, far better than he did the first 2 years of his
       first term.
       But the issue arises from the fact that this is the debate.  We are
       in the first hundred days, and as far as I know, this is the first
       time we are debating the losing parties agenda.
       That is the macro sense is a win for Republicans.  It does two
       things.
       1. It drags the President into the mud when he has a halo from
       reelection.
       2.  It diminishes the chances of meeting core promises to his
       coalition as the clock for the first hundred days is run out.  If
       certain items are not addressed (I.e. immigration) and Republicans
       are successful in dragging the economy down,  Democrats will have
       another bad mid term, which is exactly what the Republican strategy
       is about.
       The issue was created back when the President decided to focus on
       debt and winning the future at a time of high unemployment.  It's a
       shame that we are here talking about Romney's agenda instead of
       Obamas due to a bad decision to move to winning the future and
       focusing on the debt 3 years ago. The legacy of the New
       Democrat/Orzag/Emanuael/Obama led decision, is the gift that keeps
       giving. Ever since the debt commission was created, there has been
       no space to discuss jobs.  This is a self inflicted wound that will
       be tough to get out of.
       They are doing there beat with this hand, but one is left to wonder
       whether getting into this game was wise for 2012 and beyond.  Maybe
       he had to in order to win reelection, but I do not believe this is
       the case.
       This is going to be the struggle of a lifetime to maintain earned
       benefit levels and control debt through better care and tax
       increases on high income earners. This is a fight we are losing.
       And Democrats are aiding and abetting.
       If I hear how good an idea chained CPI is again, like that is going
       to win votes, I am going to scream.
       19% of the public believe Democrats are better than Republicans on
       National Defense.  That happens when you refuse to nominate a
       Democrat for Defense or CIA.  And now, we are headed down the same
       path by allowing the discussion to focus on debt instead of jobs,
       immigration, climate.
       They are doing fine with the current hand, but this game should
       never have been played.  I am afraid of the repercussions of this
       process, although I still think Dems have the current upper hand.

 "Suicide by Sequester"... ([394]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [395]MPociask

   This article, by John T. Harvey in [396]Forbes explains why the
   sequester, and infliction of austerity is a crisis of choice, not
   necessity.

     The comedy of errors being played out in Washington would be funny
     were it not for the fact that the real victims will be well outside
     the Beltway. Estimates of the job loss from sequestration range from
     750,000 to 1 million. Not a single one of those will be from the
     individuals responsible for this debacle.

   "Not a single one of these" (lost jobs) "will be from the individuals
   responsible for this debacle."  That's the problem.  The GOPers are
   playing politics, hoping to gain political ground by unnecessarily
   inflicting economic chaos on the country and economic pain on people
   who have already suffered job losses, losses of homes, or significant
   loss of the values of their largest assets--their homes, etc.

   The realities are:

     ...We will lose employees from education, the military, law
     enforcement, courts, national parks, and more. The economy will
     almost certainly fall back into recession, long term growth will be
     stunted, and confidence will be shattered.

     And this helps how?

     It doesn't...

     ...what's even worse is that there is no long-term payoff, either.
     The idea that we have a debt and deficit problem is patently
     false...

   The author goes on to explain why the GOPer's panicky "sky is falling"
   claims about the "deficit problem" are wrong.


     (The fallacy): If we don't reduce the national debt, the US could
     default: This is the biggest fallacy of them all. Every penny of US
     debt is owed in a currency we are legally permitted to print. There
     is ZERO chance that we could be forced to default.

     (The fallacy: The debt must be repaid: We must, of course, meet the
     "monthly payments," but the level of debt need never be zero. The
     government has an infinite life span, so there is no day of
     reckoning when all debts must be settled....

   These points and others that have been promoted by the deficit hawks
   are disputed in more detail in the article.  The main point is that the
   republicans are willing to do anything--including bringing financial
   devastation to individuals, or recession to the economy--anything, if
   they think they can retain political power by doing so.

   This time, very few people are buying their lies.

 To the contrary - ([405]0+ / 0-)
       We should be driving the meme and the conversation about spending
       and the deficit at maximum volume.  Let's address loud and clear
       the fiscal decisions that got us to our current state of deficit in
       the first place; and no, it's not PBO and it's not the social
       safety net.
       Congress raised the debt limit 7 times during G.W. Bush's
       presidency, from $5.9 trillion to $11.3 trillion.  Nearly 50% of
       this near doubling of the national debt from 2000 to 2008 is
       attributed to the Bush tax cuts and the Bush wars.  The legacy of
       these fiscal policies continued to drive the deficits of PBO's
       first term: the Bush tax cuts and wars account for ~60% of the $5
       trillion rise in national debt 2008-2012, and the impact of reduced
       tax revenues due to the linger effects of economic downturn account
       for ~30%.
       The GOP is fond of insisting that we address the spending that got
       us to this level of deficit in the first place.  Democrats should
       be eager to do so.
