[24]Southern Republican governors discover hurricanes, decide sequestration
is bad

   Rick Scott
   Moment of realization
   Florida Gov. Rick Scott, you are a dumbass. Sorry, but there's really
   no other professional political way to put it. It looks once again like
   a group of austerity-obsessed Republicans have suddenly discovered a
   pressing new need for some of those parts of government they decided
   they didn't want to pay for. Specifically, the part they suddenly
   discover [30]personally affects them:

     With Tropical Storm Chantal headed for South Florida with landfall
     likely Saturday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott is sounding alarm bells
     about the impact of National Guard furloughs on state storm
     preparations. "The problem is you're losing training time, you're
     losing preparation time," Scott said during a radio interview in
     Jacksonville. "When will the National Guard make the decision that
     we stop the furloughs? Right after the hurricane hits?"

   Mr. Scott, I have it on very good authority that the National Guard has
   been implementing furloughs because Republicans insisted they not be
   paid enough to avoid furloughs. It was called sequestration and it was
   in all the papers. You may have heard of it.

     Scott joined with two other Southern Republican governors whose
     states are in the path of tropical storms to write a letter to
     President Obama urging him to call off the furloughs. In Florida,
     nearly 1,000 employees of the National Guard are furloughed once a
     week, saving the federal government money under the congressionally
     mandated sequester but costing the state in readiness.

   One of those two other Southern Republican governors is of course Bobby
   Jindal, most famous for being pissed off at something called "volcano
   monitoring" because his state doesn't have volcanos, but a firm
   believer in "hurricane monitoring" because Bobby Jindal only believes
   in things he can see out his window. It isn't so much an ideological
   conviction for him as it is pure self-centeredness, self-centeredness
   above and beyond that of the usual Republican wag.

   So that's great, you're sending a letter off to President Obama saying
   you're very very peeved about the congressionally mandated requirement
   that members of the National Guard be furloughed because Republicans
   have insisted not just on implementing what all parties agreed at the
   beginning was the Stupidest Possible Way to cut spending, but are now
   insisting that we not actually fix because Congress is literally simply
   too incompetent to pass any better idea. You know who would be a better
   person to complain to than President Obama? The damn Republicans who
   insist on the furloughs. The people who put the "mandate" in the
   "congressional mandate" part. You even have their numbers, it wouldn't
   be a hard call.

   Unless, of course, this isn't actually about avoiding potentially
   dangerous cuts to government safety programs, but about moving money
   around (the executive branch can't do a whole lot of that either, by
   the way) so as to screw somebody else in order to reverse only the cuts
   to government safety that affect you, and your state, and the people
   who will have your head on a plastic cafeteria tray if you screw things
   up. Because that wouldn't just be stupid, that'd make you kind of a
   bastard.

   My lingering suspicion has long been that the House, crippled by their
   own ideological schisms, incompetence and eff-it-all approach to
   government, will never be able to actually pass any legislation that
   removes the need for government-wide furloughs, program cancellations,
   and other drastic measures. They'll just go through the entire roster
   of government duties one-by-one, refunding each and every thing a week
   after the cut to that thing resulted in either a minor fiasco or an
   outright disaster, and only when the fiascos or outright disasters are
   things they can personally see out their office windows. That seems to
   be the case--though if we count recent House Republican reactions to
   natural disasters not in their own states but merely in other
   Republican-led states, even that might might be expecting too much of
   them.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [53]Tagging tips - [54]Search For Tags - [55]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       sponsorship for them.  Private corporations would be even more
       efficient than charities, after all.
       "This hurricane disaster relief is brought to you by Kraft Foods.
       When you think of disasters, think Kraft."
       Instead of naming storms and hurricanes after people, like Sandy
       and Chantal, they could be named for their corporate sponsors.
       "North Carolina battens down in anticipation of the landfall of
       Superstorm Kraft Foods.  Residents should take shelter."
       It would be awesome.  :^P

       That is doubtful considering that South Florida votes generally
       Democratic. Parts of Miami vote Republican because Castro is still
       alive and the Ros-lehtinen and Diaz - Balarts remind them at
       election time. Wy do you think we still have an embargo. Keep this
       in mind: when in Florida, the further north you go, the further

   Immediate crisis over.

   And I'm not at all convinced there's anything "dumbass" about this.
   Seems to me this was the Republican plan all along - take the "shared
   pain" of the sequester but then fight for piecemeal restoration of
   funding for just those programs they want (ideally paid for by even
   more cuts to Democratic programs.)

   The dumbasses were the Democrats who signed on to the sequester on the
   absurd theory that Republicans deal in good faith.

       There will never be a camera crew on the scene showing the breaking
       crisis among underprivileged toddlers denied Head Start placements.
        There won't be any breaking updates on the conditions of poor
       elderly patrons of Meals-on-Wheels who slowly fall victim to
       malnutrition.  No blonde TV anchors will highlight an expose on the
       countless other programs that effect the daily lives of people
       living on the margins.
       So those programs will never be re-funded.  They are invisible to
       the people who matter.
       It is EXACTLY what they wanted all along.
       More evidence:  The House will now consider two separate bills on
       Farm subsidies and SNAP.  Guess which one will pass?

   The issue is not that dumbasses like the teabaggers  and their
   governors.  The problem is no one calls them on their hypocrisy.
   Damned right I'd make political hay.

   The GOP cannot govern.  That cannot be emphasized enough.  Democrats
   keep treating Republicans as if they belong to a legitimate political
   party that has legitimate ideas.  That horse left the barn a long time
   ago.

   Aww, how many more mandatory vaginal probe laws have to be passed
   before even the White House refuses to meet with the GOP.  Why?
   Because them and their party are fucking bat shit crazy and they need
   to be told so.  Then treated as the pariahs they are.

   Rick Scott is a symptom of the degenerate GOP lunacy.  It goes waaaay

       Charlie Crist was like a weather vane. He pointed whichever way the
       political winds were blowing. Overall, he was probably more left
       than right. He is another that didn't so much leave the party as
       that the party left him. In the whole scheme of things he wasn't a
       bad Governor. Rumor has it tht the campaign to portray him as gay
       came from the right, not from opponents on the left. And we all
       know that being gay in the Republican party is a death sentence.
       You can have gay children, you can assume a wide stance in the
       airport men's room, but you cannot be openly gay and survive. God
       will donate enough money to the opposition to prevent that.

 Military Problems ([816]0+ / 0-)

   The furloughs could have been avoided, but the military loves to waste
   money.  Money like the $35 million spent on a new HQ in Afghanistan
   that will not be used.  That is just one building; I am willing to bet
   there will be more.  Air Force Aircraft will fly for 10 hours, and only
   accomplish 2 hours of training, then play around for the next 8 hours.
    That equals 8 hours of wasted fuel in an aircraft, or 1,300 gallons in
   many aircraft.  One wastes 1,300 gallon, now multiply that by a
   thousand aircraft every day for a year. I know of some units that went
   months without printer toner, paper, etc, so the command could buy new
   golf carts for all the officers....Military leaders arranged the
   furloughs for two reasons.  First to allow Military Officers to keep
   their toys, and to continue to waste resources, second to make everyone
   feel the pain a little more.

 National Guard and State Militias ([819]0+ / 0-)

   ([820]http://www.ngef.org/...)

     "The National Guard is the organized militia reserved to the states
     by the Constitution of the United States under Article 1, Section 8.
     In peacetime, the National Guard is commanded by the governor of
     each respective state or territory. When ordered to active duty for
     mobilization or called into federal service for emergencies, units
     of the Guard are under the control of the appropriate service
     secretary."

   Does the "War on Terrorism" count as an actual war under the
   Constitution even though the Congress has not issued a "Declaration of
   War"? If not, why isn't the Governor executing his authority over his
   state's National Guard?  Of course, the state would probably have to
   fund from its own budget its costs of activation of its National Guard.


   Anyhow, wouldn't it be interesting if a Governor did that?
