[24]House GOP sends clear message with Hurricane Sandy vote: They're ready to
cave on debt limit

   Outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hands the speaker's gavel to
   incoming House Speaker John Boehner after Boehner was elected Speaker
   on the opening day of the 112th United States Congress on Capitol Hill
   in Washington, January 5, 2011. Republicans are t
   When House Speaker John Boehner needs the votes to get something done,
   he turns to Democrats.
   Yesterday, the House of Representatives [30]finally voted to approve
   long overdue relief aid for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. That's good
   news, and it's a story in and of itself, but there's another important
   story about vote--the measure passed despite overwhelming Republican
   opposition.

   Here are the [31]raw numbers:

     Yeas: 241 (192 Democrats, 49 Republicans)
     Nays: 180 ("Democrat" Jim Cooper + 179 Republicans)

   This sort of thing isn't supposed to happen when Republicans control
   the house. Unlike Democrats, Republicans have a longstanding informal
   rule that no legislation will come up for a vote unless a majority of
   Republicans support it. That rule--dubbed the Hastert Rule after former
   GOP House Speaker Dennis Hastert--is supposed to prevent outcomes like
   the one last night, where a united Democratic Party teams up with a
   divided GOP to pass legislation overwhelmingly opposed by Republicans.

   But last night they ignored the rule--and it was the second time they
   ignored it this year. The first time was on New Year's Day, when 85
   Republicans joined 172 Democrats in passing the [32]tax cliff deal
   despite opposition from 151 Republicans.

   Until 2013, the Hastert Rule had only been broken once before under
   John Boehner's speakership, and that was on [33]an obscure measure
   dealing with weights and measurements. Moreover, on that vote
   Republicans were actually nearly evenly divided, with 118 Republicans
   supporting the bill and 122 opposing it. (Boehner didn't vote, so it
   was really 119 to 122.)

   Now, however, Republicans have done it twice--and they've done it twice
   in two weeks. Not only that, but yesterday the fifth-ranking House
   Republican [34]refused to rule out doing it again with the debt limit.
   Altogether, it's as clear a sign as you could possibly get that
   Republican leaders aren't going to block a debt limit increase.
   Instead, they'll let their members create as much drama as possible,
   but will in the end allow the a debt limit increase to come to the
   floor where it will pass with the backing of all or nearly all
   Democrats.

   Yes, it's true that far-right groups like Club for Growth, The Family
   Research Council, and The Heritage Foundation are [35]still saber
   rattling about the debt limit. But these are the same clowns that were
   saber rattling about the Hurricane Sandy vote--and they lost. As Brian
   Beutler exhaustively [36]outlines, every major sign points to a lack of
   resolve on the part of House Republican leadership to block an increase
   in the debt limit. And it's not just talking heads showing a lack of
   interest in brinksmanship. As Greg Sargent reported yesterday, there
   two Republican Senators have now gone on the record [37]opposing a debt
   limit crisis.

   And now that House Republicans have conducted back-to-back major votes
   in which they've basically ceded power to a coalition of Democrats and
   the handful of responsible Republicans, they've set a precedent--on
   major issues facing the nation, a minority of the House doesn't get
   veto power just because it happens to be a majority of the GOP. That
   precedent provides the only viable path forward on the debt limit and
   it is almost certainly the path that will ultimately be followed. The
   big question is whether it will tear apart the GOP in the process.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       TGhat there is no way for his Radical Caucus to do anything. So
       he's isolating them so that the Republican Brand isn't burned
       anymore, and just using the Dems to pass bills. I have no problem
       with this, since this is the closest to functional government I've
       seen since 2010.

       I don't think The Boner WANTS to be Speaker. Too much work. He'd
       rather be hitting the links, picking up checks, boozing it up at
       happy hour, and getting his Bronzer Special at Tahitian Tan.
       However, since he IS Speaker, I guess he figures he'd better make
       it as easy as possible so he can get to the activities listed
       above. If that means doing what he's been doing, then so be it.
       It's like speeding through work to get out early on a Friday. Been

 Boehner doing what masters want done ([193]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [194]david78209

   The money behind the Republican Party wants a functional country that
   helps rebuild disaster areas and funds necessary services. There is a
   reason that the mostly Southern GOP elected someone from Ohio to be
   Speaker and it wasn't for him to do what they publicly claim to want to
   do. Their power lies in shouting about all of the crazy things they
   want to do for the benefit of those who elect them while never actual
   getting a chance to inact any of it.

   Boehner has give his cacaus the chance make a principled stand without
   having to pay the political price of gettng their way.

       too because the things we care about most (Social Security,
       Medicare and Medicaid) are essentially exempt from the automatic
       cuts. Republicans' nuts are in a vise over those military cuts,
       though.
       Agreeing to the sequestration in the first place was a terrible
       deal for Republicans. I have no idea why they went for it, other
       than they ran out of time and it was their last chance to avoid
       being blamed for forcing the U.S. into default back in 2011.

 they will agree to strip the defense sequester ([251]0+ / 0-)
       in exchange for the Republicans agreeing not to make a fuss about
       the debt ceiling for the moment.
       Then the GOP will threaten to inflict the sequester--which will
       then consist solely of across-the-board domestic spending cuts--on
       the whole country.
       Obama will put SS and Medicare on the table in exchange for the GOP
       agreeing to defer the sequestered cuts, and after a few further
       rounds of negotiation, the Democrats will reluctantly acquiesce to
       avoid economic catastrophe.
       Then the GOP will accept Obama's offer because it won't include tax
       raises (the only thing they ever found objectionable). The Grand
       Bargain will be concluded.
       The OP is right--Obama has not blown his leverage. However, it was
       never the Republicans he was trying to coerce, but the Democrats.
       The debt ceiling was a poor weapon--the GOP could not have used it
       without blowing themselves up.
       The sequester minus the defense cuts is a much better weapon--it
       points only at the Democrats, not them. And they, of course, will
       happily use it if given the chance. 'Cuz they love cutting the
       budget, it's the only thing they love besides lowering taxes.
       And Obama will help give it to them, in order to further his goal
       of a Grand Bargain. That's what his whole speech was about. He
       announced he will disarm, and they will respond in kind by
       pretending to disarm--in exchange for being given another, much
       more effective weapon which they will promptly threaten to use.

       This is something that many on the left either cannot see or won't
       admit.
       On several occasions, Obama has alluded to his use of compromise to
       isolate extremism. The idea that we would be in a stronger position
       if we had assumed a more aggressive negotiating posture is dead
       wrong for two reasons: 1) we would have gotten nothing anyway given
       the current make-up of Congress, and 2) we would have unified
       Republicans for essentially no return.
       Obama's conciliation got him re-elected. Poll after poll, before
       and after the election, has shown overwhelming majorities receptive
       to the framing of compromise.  His re-election is the reason he is
       now in a position to tell Republicans to fuck off.
       No. We would absolutely not have been better off stooping to the
       Republicans' level.  The Republicans are uncompromising racists who
       simply cannot say yes to anything Obama proposes. For the life of
       me, I don't understand why so many on the left are so opposed to
       killing Republicans with their own intolerance, because that's what
       Obama's been doing for the last four years.

       functional government has always included compromise.

       The sequester doesn't get thrown out, they get re-allocated:
       programs unsupported by lobbyists get cut. If the sequester
       negotiations are where Chained CPI is introduced into a bill (the
       President has already introduced it as a policy choice), that would
       be pretty awful.
       That said, despite all this drama, I still think the debt ceiling
       will be part of the "deal", officially or not. If the GOP actually

 Boehner still needs to save face ([409]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [410]sethtriggs, [411]Algernons Labyrinth, [412]METAL TREK

   It's annoying that this matters so much, but after investing this much
   political capital in a two year temper tantrum, Boehner can't just
   cave.  He needs to get something before he allows a deal to come to the
   floor and pass with all D's + sane R's.

   I think all the worst ideas (chained CPI, Medicare age hike) are off
   the table.  The final deal will probably rescind some, but not all, of
   the defense cuts, and it will restore funding to a handful of popular
   discretionary programs.  Maybe there are less controversial
   nickel-and-dime cuts to Medicare.  Any revenues to offset the changes
   to the sequestration will come from "tax reform" (i.e. completely
   ineffective eliminations of loopholes and deductions that won't
   actually bring in much new revenue, but will be scored otherwise).  In
   exchange for giving away most of the farm, the president will gain the
   authority to unilaterally raise the debt limit unless a supermajority
   in both chambers disapproves, which would let Republicans make hissy
   fit votes for the foreseeable future without risking default.

   That last one seems like common sense to us, but from the Tea Party's
   point of view it will represent an unconscionable betrayal of
   conservative "values," since it will basically signal to the Tea Party
   that they've already extracted all of the spending cuts they'll get out
   of this president.

   I wouldn't be happy with a deal like the one above, but it's difficult
   to see a more favorable outcome that isn't a completely humiliating
   defeat from Boehner's point of view.

       My guess is they'll demand the death of Head Start, which is a very
       good somewhat inefficient target because it's poor kids who aren't

       how he wants to spin "grand bargain". Defense is untouchable in
       this country until some enterprising coalition figures out how to
       shift the munitions payouts over to solar and infrastructure.
       However, in a grand bargain scenario, maybe some Defense cuts can
       be made with Hagel / Obama / Reid / Pelosi figuring out how to
       punish the teacaucus with geographically targeted pain.
       There's also my preferred "completely humiliating defeat from
       Boehner's point of view" scenario which is all phoney revenue, no
       more debt limit hostage taking and on to the budget battles where
       Pelosi and Reid rout their whole caucus.
       They wanted the final showdown with the New Deal. Let's hope the

     The big question is whether it will tear apart the GOP in the
     process.

   To be realistic, it's unlikely.  As others have pointed out, death of
   either the Democratic Party or the GOP has been frequently predicted
   but never seems to happen.
   What does happen is major shifts in what and whom the parties
   represent.  After seeing the movie "Lincoln" my fourteen year old son
   mused on how odd it is that the 'party of Lincoln' now speaks for
   racism.

   We're all pretty strange one way or another; some of us just hide it
   better. "Normal" is a dryer setting.

       ones who were all about civil rights, while Democrats were truly
       the vile racists of the country.
       Oddly enough, all his examples were pre-1960.  Gee, I can't imagine

       No way it ends the GOP--even if that happened, another party would
       take it's place, that's the nature of our winner-takes-all
       political system--but I do think it's possible for the party to be
       divided and rendered less potent. So that's what I'm hoping for.
       Tear apart might have been a bit too colorful a way of putting it.

   The GOP extremists - in the solid majority and seemingly able to

   major issue they can respond to, raise or concoct. Meanwhile, if the
   time is right and the issue is set up strategically, it could be ripe
   for GOP leadership to send it to the House floor where it might well
   garner some votes of Republicans unwilling to be associated with
   extremists.

   Many Coulds, Mights, Ifs and Somes in there, to be sure, but ...

   ... this means picking an issue carefully and putting resources behind
   it. To position it, we have to garner public support, as deep and
   widespread as possible ...and make it visible in districts that could
   reasonably be swing districts. It means getting media attention,
   personalizing the issue for why it matters and how it matters to real
   people, not high and vague abstractions.

   Recall that the H.R. had tossed the Sandy relief overboard and were

   In the first two years of Reagan's presidency, the Republicans

   able to get most of his program enacted by peeling off enough House
   Democrats to vote with the Republicans.

   The situation isn't symmetrical because the filibuster is used so much

   able to get something done (if he pushed as hard and effectively for
