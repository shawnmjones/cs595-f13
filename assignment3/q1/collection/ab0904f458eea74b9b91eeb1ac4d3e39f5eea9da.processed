   Let's have a vote about where this community stands on Syria. But
   before we do that, let me try and condense the two arguments (pro and
   con intervention):
   Interventionists. Those supporting the president's apparent proposal
   for limited strikes to "degrade" or deter Syria's ability to use
   chemical weapons against its own people believe that such behavior--the
   indiscriminate slaughter of civilians (including children)--cannot be
   left unpunished. The United States has a moral obligation to enforce
   international standards, as well as support allies in the region more
   directly affected by the conflict. If we don't act, American
   credibility will be compromised.

   Non-interventionists. The slaughter in Syria is horrific, but our
   ability to impact an internal Syrian matter is limited. A limited
   bombing campaign is so incapable of solving the problem, that even its
   boosters talk only of "sending a message". And if the message is "kill
   all the people you want, just not with chemical weapons," what happens
   if and when Assad gasses his own people again? Finally, engaging in the
   war on the side of rebels dominated by Islamists worked out not-so-well
   in Afghanistan. What makes anyone think things will be different this
   time?
   Those should be fair representations of both arguments. I've made clear
   in the past week where I personally stand, but I'm now interested in
   getting an honest look at where the rest of the site stands. So please
   vote below.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       From the UK Independent:
       [183]Special report: We all thought Libya had moved on - it has,
       but into lawlessness and ruin: Libya has plunged unnoticed into its
       worst political and economic crisis since the defeat of Gaddafi

     As world attention focused on the coup in Egypt and the poison gas
     attack in Syria over the past two months, Libya has plunged
     unnoticed into its worst political and economic crisis since the
     defeat of Gaddafi two years ago. Government authority is
     disintegrating in all parts of the country putting in doubt claims
     by American, British and French politicians that Nato's military
     action in Libya in 2011 was an outstanding example of a successful
     foreign military intervention which should be repeated in Syria.

     In an escalating crisis little regarded hitherto outside the oil
     markets, output of Libya's prized high-quality crude oil has plunged
     from 1.4 million barrels a day earlier this year to just 160,000
     barrels a day now. Despite threats to use military force to retake
     the oil ports, the government in Tripoli has been unable to move
     effectively against striking guards and mutinous military units that
     are linked to secessionist forces in the east of the country.
       Such a wonderful future for Syria.

   with Iran), does human rights become such a pressing concern.

          [290]Buckeye Nut Schell, [291]Orla, [292]Lepanto

   The reason I opposed war is not stated in the Kos Non-interventionist
   reasoning for his poll. I oppose war because our media and government
   are lying to us, as they did in the last three major wars we
   participated in.

   The Tribune Washington Bureau news, today, pointed out that the alleged
   gas attack, according to the US pro-war crowd, has killed 1,429
   Syrians. In fact, only killed 281 according to French intel, and only
   330 according to English intel were killed. The big number is used to
   incite war.

   Today in France, the MPs are actually having a debate. Polls in France
   show 3/4 of the people do oppose war without a parliamentory vote. The
   French don't believe in war.

   In an interview on television today, Russian President Vladimir Putin
   warned the West that military action against the Syrian regime without
   UN support would be considered an "aggression".

   Putin also said he did "not exclude" the possibility of Russia backing
   strikes if it could be conclusively proved that the Syrian regime had
   carried out chemical attacks.

   Assad had nothing to gain from the gassing, IMHO the gassing was done
   by those who would gain from the bad publicity--those who want regime

       is not particularly telling.
       When did British / French intelligence make those estimates? Two
       things happen:
       1) More people die from their injuries. Not all deaths are
       instantaneous
       2) A better count is obtained as more hospitals report deaths. It
       took hours (days) to obtain accurate count of the dead and wounded
       after the Boston Marathon bombing - in a city in the United States
       with a functioning government. It's going to take days to get a
       handle on something in Syria
       It would not surprise me at all if numbers varied by a factor of 5
       with everyone being perfectly honest and reporting the truth as
       they knew it at the time. No CT is required.

     Three hospitals in Syria's Damascus governorate that are supported
     by the international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans
     Frontières (MSF) have reported to MSF that they received
     approximately 3,600 patients displaying neurotoxic symptoms in less
     than three hours on the morning of Wednesday, August 21, 2013. Of
     those patients, 355 reportedly died. - See more at:
     [310]http://www.emptywheel.net/...
       Roughly 10% had died when MSF gave their report.
       Suppose another X% died later as the results of sarin are not
       instantaneous.
       Suppose another group died and were never transported to the
       hospital at all. If someone is already dead, will you transport
       them through a war zone to a hospital?
       It does not require a CT to have many more casualties than MSF
       reported at a particular point in time. All it requires is chaos,
       which war zones have in abundance.

   it's clear that the US is using data from MSF not only without giving

   also made the comment that any action relating to war should be based
   on the UN findings.

   It's sad when pro-war advocate think so lightly about the killings of
   yet more human beings, that they suggest that an independent UN report
   is meaningless.

   Obama has nothing to gain from striking given no regime change will
   occur and, if it turns out that Assad didn't do it, it could be
   political suicide for the President and the Democratic Party.  So
   explain to me, if you're so sure Assad didn't do it and the President
   knows that, that he'd be willing to go in anyway?  It seems far more
   likely that we are on that brink of going in because the powers that be
   1. Know for certain where the attack came from and 2. That the final
   political outcome from attacking, despite the unease today, seems to be
   work the risk.

   We're not talking about George Bush and Cheney here.  While there was
   plenty in their history to show they would act for immediate self-gain,
   there's nothing in Obama or Kerry's history to show that inclination.

   That said, I'm still basically against striking here but I am far away
   from the idea that someone but Assad did this.

 Benefit of the Doubt About What? ([476]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [477]RFK Lives

   In Syria the issue is not whether chemical weapons have been used, they
   most certainly have. But it seems far more plausible that they were
   deployed by the rebels(backed by Saudi Arabia and Israel, the two
   states most eager for a western intervention in Syria), than by Assad
   whose us eof such weapons in the midst of a UN investigation could only
   bring reprisal.

   The case put forth by the Obama Administration is twofold - 1) based
   upon the dubious prerogative - not recognized in internaitonal law - of
   needing to send a message and 2) that of the necessity to degrade
   certain military capabilities of the Syraan gov't.  However, even
   assuming Assad is guilty as charge, if the chemical weapons were kept
   in a small number of easily identfiable locations (which is not the
   case), or if they could be delivered only through military assets that
   can be readily located and easily destroyed (also not the case), the
   issues we are struggling with would be far more straight-forward.

   But reality is different than the pictures we've painted in our public
   pronouncements of the facts.  The missile strikes are not expected to
   eliminate or affect chemical weapons capability of the Syrian gov't.

   Hence, an honest assessment of how Assad's gov't or military, if
   guilty, can be effectively deterred is very different from how their
   supposed  chemical weapons delivery systems can be taken out .

 Yes, how to either degrade ([481]0+ / 0-)
       chemical weapons capability or deter them if not possible is the
       main question.  But insofar as the number of times you've killed
       bin Laden is zero, your view of what is or is not the case is not
       interesting to me, and your refusal to accept Assad's culpability
       based on tautologic reasoning alone already makes your conclusions
       less credible.  (Even if you're right, you're wrong.)  You're not
       of course responsible for pushing the invasion, but as a reason not
       to give the administration the benefit of the doubt per the subject
       line, you didn't achieve it.
       As far as int'l law goes, there's a valid objection about the
       process, but pointing to Russian and Chinese subversion of the
       goals and obligations of the Security Council to protect their
       client is elevating form over substance.  A multilateral, limited
       strike is consistent with the spirit of international law, which is
       after all, the sum of agreements and practices by independent
       states anyway.

       we will achieve anything at good all let alone being greeted as
       liberators.
       The BEST case scenerio is that this bombing will teach Assad some
       undefined lesson about gassing his own people.  That is the best
       case scenerio.  Not even the biggest supporters claim anything more
       substantial or measurable than that.
       The worst is that Russia and China will get involved as the did in
       Vietnam and this will become another quagmire and Assad will give
       his chemical weapons to terrorists who will then use them against
       us in our strategic locations throughout the region.  The worst
       might be that we will defeat Assad and the rebels will take power.
        That is all we need in the region is another fundamentalist,
       extremist group of theocrats who have no idea how to govern but
       know about religious purity running their country into the ground.
       Russia could take this act as an act of aggression towards one of
       its allies and they would be correct.  Not only is gassing your own
       citizen's not a justification for acts of war against a sovereign
       nation but shooting missles into a sovereign nation who has not
       posed any threat to your country is a war crime.
       AND all of that assumes that Assad DID use chemical weapons against
       his own people which is a circumstantial case at best.

       But Rwanda was a much tougher situation. The violence there was
       person-to-person, and would have been very difficult to stop
       without a massive on-the-ground presence. Add to this that it
       happened very quickly. I don't think the world really grasped the
       magnitude of it until it was basically over.
       Surely, we could have done more than what we did (i.e. nothing),
       but all these situations are unique. It's hard to make direct
       comparisons... which is why I roll my eyes when people say that

       I think something more in Rwanda at least should have been tried.
       Instead, the whole world washed its hands of it and walked away and
       felt kinda bad while a terrible genocide unfolded in front of us.
       But it was complex, and I don't know what the right answer would
       have been, insomuch as there could even be said to be a "right
       answer."
       Each situation is only itself, and while looking at other
       situations can sometimes add insights, they can also be used to
       obfuscate. Syria isn't Libya, Libya wasn't Iraq, Iraq wasn't
       Vietnam, and none of them have a rat's behind to do with Nazis,
       really.
       These situations will always have unique factors that have to be
       considered as themselves, and sometimes there are decent options,
       and sometimes there aren't. History never actually repeats itself,
       though it does follow some consistent threads.

   The ground attacks in Benghazi had very little to do with our conduct
   in the Libyan civil war, and were entirely avoidable by having had
   better security protocol in the first place (including a Congress that
   properly funded US State Department security services). What Benghazi
   was - a soft target that was created in the wake of the Libyan conflict
   well after the civil war was over.

   US involvement, and NATO's, in the Libyan conflict ended a bloody
   conflict far sooner that it would have, and likely with a better
   result. You cannot shy from force as a means of getting to political
   ends; it does not always, or even often, work, but it can work.

       as he frames it rests almost entirely on the idea that "limited
       strikes" will be ineffectual-- ie we know in advance that they
       can't address any of the admin's own stated aims.  But I don't buy
       that.  This is about regime change.  Notwithstanding some of what
       Obama, Kerry et al are now claiming, if you listen to the rest of
       what they're claiming, and especially their signals to the GOP
       hawks in past 24 hrs, they DO believe that these "limited strikes"
       can begin the process of ending the Assad regime.
       I think "limited airstrikes" are the new "no-fly zone", from the
       Libya example.   Yes the UN resolution in that case said only
       "no-fly zone," but that was after the Russians and Chinese made it
       clear that they'd veto a resolution that was any more explicit
       about regime change.  But at the same time there seemed to be broad
       wink-wink signals that the NATO forces would not stop at grounding
       Ghaddafi's puny air force, but would immediately start going after
       ground targets too, and ultimately simply act as the rebels' air
       support.
       In this case, too, I hear "limited airstrikes" and I think, yeah,
       "no-fly zone"...
       The Syria intervention needs to be either opposed or supported as
       what it is, a bid at regime change, ill-advised or not.

 Not Necessarily ([755]0+ / 0-)
       There is still a serious debate on whther the nuclear bombs on
       Japan caused more or less casualities.  It is clear there were
       fewer American casualties by dropping the bombs and ending the war
       quickly.  What is not clear is that overall casualties were
       increased or decreased.

       US/allied casualties in invading Japan could have been 1 million,
       if things went badly.  Or as few as 50,000.  With no bomb, it comes
       out that dropping one bomb could have saved even as few as 50,000
       American lives - the public would be livid!
       Whats CERTAIN, is that between 10 and 15 million Japanese citizens
       would have died of starvation and firebombings between August and
       November 1945, when the invasion of Kyuushu would have happened.
       Compared to the 300,000 that died at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which
       was better?  300,000 died from two horriffic bombings, or 15
       million from starvation over several months?

       does anyone contemplate whether, if the bomb had NOT been used, the

       USSR?  Have not researched this, there may be valid (and more
       informed than mine) opinions around...
       I do not challenge the rest of your argument, that there was less
       overall death due to dropping the bomb.  Getting Japan to surrender
       took TWO bombs... which IMO means if conventional warfare remained
       the approach, Japan would not have surrendered, even after
       experiencing the slaughter of millions of its citizens.

       Brutal as it was, the atomic bombs in Japan showed the world the
       horror of nuclear warfare, and essentially helped scare us
       straight. Without that example, might the USSR or USA been more
       trigger-happy during the cold war? We'll never know of course, but
       it's another thing to consider.

 Per my above question, if we had NOT ([782]0+ / 0-)
       dropped the bomb, the Russians might not have gotten it for many
       years... other nations as well.  In that scenario, there would not
       have been a cold war, at least as such, as the U.S. would have
       dominated the rest of the world by virtue of being the only nation
       having the bomb.  The rest of that scenario is obviously only
       speculation...  Interesting to contemplate, however.
       Russia's gaining nuclear capability provided the context for the
       next 40 years.  Which, of course, was the Rosenberg's purpose in
       providing the info to them Russkies...  They knew a political

   Germany had already fell and Japan was well down that road.

   Why did Truman drop two atomic bombs on Japan, then?

   It was to frighten and slow down the Soviet Union.

   Stalin was already moving into Europe and occupying nations and he had
   his eyes on China and Japan, too.

   the bombs were sent as a message to Stalin to slow down and think about
   it.

 Not giving up ([826]0+ / 0-)

   Last night I was re-reading a book entitled "World War II Through
   German Eyes" by James Lucas. One thing that struck me is how Nazi
   leaders clung to a hope of winning, even in April 1945, in spite of
   evidence to the contrary. Goebbels and others figured Stalin and the
   western allies would have a falling out and Germany could choose sides.
   Actually he was right, but premature, and the falling out came after
   the war.
   I would think the Japanese thought like the Nazis, but even more so.
   After all, Japan has always been a pretty insular nation.
   btw I do think this country's Right Wing is similar. Republicans
   believe they can destroy the Affordable Care Act if they just hold out.
    The Religious Right is losing here, so they are using Russia and
   Africa as beachheads to make a comeback here. The Koch brothers believe
   they can prevail if they just keep spending on campaigns.

   If Al Qaeda wins, there will be a long slow bloodbath as Syria is

   that psych assessment isn't important, but there is no substantiation

   Assad and as horrible as this may sound, that may not be the best thing
   at this point for the Syrian people anyway. An attack may bring Assad
   to the negotiating table. At the very least it will hopefully degrade
   his ability to use chem weapons w/o opening the door to rebels seizing
   them.

   PS I am not in favor of attack, but the calculus is changing daily re
   reports of Putin wavering and defections from Assad's regime. Sadaam's
   biggest mistake is not believing we would invade. Assad may make the

       Republicans and Democrats are the same. That may be convenient for

   Difference one: Iraq didn't actually have CW. No one disputes that

   Difference two: We sent thousands of troops into Iraq. We won't send
   any into Syria. Don't go slippery slope on me; no one is going to hold
   a gun to Obama's head and force him to do what he has said he won't do.

   Difference three: Bush & Cheney spoke of their intention to spread
   Democracy by force. Obama makes no such statements and is not even
   trying to cause regime change

   Difference four: Obama is not trying to re-arrange the Middle East

   Difference five: Joe Biden's former employer is not going to be getting
   multi-year non-compete contracts to supply occupying troops in Syria

   Difference six: Cheney sent Douglas Feith over to the CIA to try to
   compel them to lie to support the desired war. No one can point to a
   similar person this time around

   I'd say that's enough differences, but if you want I can probably do

 Beg to slightly differ on difference 1 ([1048]0+ / 0-)
       Many knew (at least many here at dkos) that Iraq had CW as we had
       sold (see rummy handshake) them to them during their Iran - Iraq
       battles.  Just recently, it was confirmed that the US also
       greenlighted the use of them.
       Now one may argue that by the time of the Cheney  War on Iraq,much
       of those CW could have been degraded by and or destroyed by
       previous inspections/ wars.
       No imho much of The real bag of lies for the Cheney Bush Preemptive
       War on Iraq really tied into the
       Iraq=AQ=9/11 connection.

       from discredited sources like Curveball.
       The Cheney Administration threw everything but the kitchen sink out
       there to justify their preemptive war doctrine...and as was
       confirmed (many suspected and few warned prior) once the disaster
       played out most of if not all was a huge bag of crap..which cost
       billions in American treasure ...but most importantly human

   In the case of Iraq, the existence of the weapons was a lie.  Would you

   In Iraq, our invasion was preemptive based on the suspicion that Iraq
   had WMD.  The question then was whether military action was required to
   prevent their use.  As we now know, the whole basis for deciding to
   move forward preemptively was based on lies - any policy that is based
   on bad or false evidence would be invalid on its face.

   In the case of Syria, we have pretty good evidence that chemical
   weapons were actually used.  Their existence isn't really in question.
    So, the question being asked now is whether some type of military
   response is necessary because of the WMD use.  There may still be
   questions as to who actually used the sarafin, and what we ought to do
   about it.  I think the situation is completely different than Iraq.

   What is troubling to me - and this is where I see the parallel - is
   that in neither case am I hearing enough about the consequences and
   aftermath of a military action on Syria.  I see it here on DailyKos -
   there is a lot of "war gaming" on what the possible subsequent actions
   Syria might take, or Iran, or Russia, or al-Queda, etc., and I'm sure
   they've done it in Washington behind closed doors, but I hope the
   Congressional debate digs deeper into this.

   As in Iraq - besides the fact that we shouldn't have gone in to begin
   with - how a military action would complicate the entire Middle East
   situation seems to be discounted so far.

   For those who have short memories, [1134]here's Obama warning Assad to
   get out of the way and embrace Democracy.

     "President Assad now has a choice: He can lead that transition, or
     get out of the way. The Syrian government must stop shooting
     demonstrators and allow peaceful protests; release political
     prisoners and stop unjust arrests; allow human rights monitors to
     have access to cities like Daraa; and start a serious dialogue to
     advance a democratic transition. Otherwise, President Assad and his
     regime will continue to be challenged from within and isolated
     abroad," he said.

   Sure sounds like an awful lot like Bush spreading Democracy, doesn't

 Obama & Chemical Weapons: ([1138]1+ / 0-)

   Let me know when Obama bans the use of Depleted Uranium and White
   Phosphorous as offense weapons.

   Then I'll have a little faith that Obama gives a damn about chemical
   weapons.

       I'm about tired as hell of hearing that depleted uranium is being
       used as a chemical weapon.  The true definition of a chemical
       weapon is one in which the CHEMICAL properties of a weapon are
       directly used to kill or injure.  Depleted uranium's main purpose
       is target penetration because of the metal density.  The word
       "depleted" is there because the radioactive properties of that
       metal are such that they are extremely reduced.  There is no
       fission going on.  The military is not using DU shells and bombs so
       that they can cause cancer and suffering of future generations.
       They are using them because modern day enemies are hiding behind
       highly fortified and armored shelters that regular warheads are
       having a hard time penetrating.
       Nasty weapons?  Yes of course but they are not being used with the
       intent of random killing of innocents as with nerve gases.  War
       zones are dangerous places.  Unexploded ordinance, crumbling
       buildings, exposed volatile substances, etc. are all much more
       devastating to future populations than the effects of DU.
       Let's keep this debate real.

       I don't give a damn what the primary function of the weapon is.
       I tend to consider the results.  And DU is something which gives,

       White Phosphorous is another horrific weapon which I also consider

   but critical differences were that the use of WMDs was in the case of
   Iraq, a hypothetical and a false one at that, and the policy (regime
   change via invasion) didn't comport with the stated goal (democracy/no
   wmds).

   Was Clinton's bombing of Iraq's chemical weapons facilities in response
   to the expulsion of inspectors "neocon?"  Had we stopped there, good.
   I don't know of too many people who were objecting to the no-fly zone
   in 2003, and that required more manned airpower than anyone's
   suggesting sending to Syria.  So, I suppose I supported "war" in Iraq
   without even realizing it.  Learn something new everyday.

   Having higher confidence in Obama's assessment of intelligence than
   Bush's is also not unreasonable, and if there were a contradiction, so
   be it.  I lived through "you supported intervention in Rwanda and the
   Balkans, why not Iraq," in part because it wouldn't have really
   mattered if I had changed my mind, although the reasoning throughout is
   consistent -- some limited, tailored military intervention to promote a
   human rights objective, and not all military use is limited, tailored,
   or promoting of a human rights objective.

   So, yes, if the reason for objecting to the neocons was that they
   supported the use of military power, or even unilateral military power,
   sure (i think the issue with Iraq was more going solo in the guise of
   enforcing UN resolutions, but no matter); but that wasn't the only
   reason people could have or did object to them.

       though " / " is a pretty thin argument, and many of the leading
       lights of PNAC are around today and don't have very nice things to
       say about Obama (which I'm sure proves it's all "kabuki.")
       Conversely, there is a long standing doctrine of liberal human
       rights intervention.  Some believers in that sadly saw what they
       wanted to see with the Iraq invasion and supported it.  You could
       fault Biden and Kerry for that, but the notion that it all derives
       from PNAC is ahistorical and largely is built from imputing "goals"
       to Obama there's very little evidence for, besides your
       bootstrapping.
       But the biggest problem with your argument is that it really has
       nothing to do with Syria, to wit, whether Assad's actions and
       position justify a military response and if so, whether the
       proposed response makes sense in light of it and is nonetheless in
       the U.S.'s interest.  The situation is serious enough that it's not
       a good opportunity to sling mud.  I'm conflicted enough about
       supporting strikes, and uncertain enough about the outcome, I don't
       have a strong desire to trumpet moral superiority, and so should

       ultimately proves to be the right outcome.

 The UN hasn't even verified the use of CW, ([1208]0+ / 0-)

   let alone whom they might have been used by.

   We have a lot of supposed "evidence" that Assad used CW, based on
   incoherent chatter that has been provided us by various intelligence
   sources. None of this has been presented to the UN; many of the details
   remain classified.

   Nor is there any urgent, overriding need to go to war. American
   interests are not threatened by waiting several months for the UN
   inspectors to do their job. There is no imminent threat whatsoever.

   Now it's true that someone took a potshot at the UN inspectors in
   Syria; but again, there's a civil war going on, so who knows who that
   might have been; the Assad regime certainly isn't in complete control
   of all Syrian territory. And the proper response to that is not to
   immediately order a military strike, but to find out who did it.

   Still the inspectors finished their work and are now analyzing the
   samples. And if they find out that CW has been used, then the US will
   be in a much stronger position to demand a full investigation of who
   did it. Even Putin would not be able to object at that point.

   Regarding the Iraq example: there was no civil war in Iraq at the time
   Clinton bombed Iraq. In Syria, we are intervening in such a war and our
   attack will affect the course of that war in unpredictable ways, that
   could spill over into other, neighboring countries.

   We could end up empowering rebel factions that are even more extreme
   and dangerous than Assad. We could end up making it possible for
   terrorists to get their hands on his CW stockpiles, if he loses control
   over them. None of these were factors in Iraq circa 1998. Iraq was
   under the full control of Saddam.

   Also, Clinton did not send troops into Iraq, nor was there ever any
   possibility that he would.

   The fact that the administration won't rule out sending US troops is
   deeply troubling. They claim they have no plans to send troops to fight
   in the civil war--but that still leaves the possibility that troops
   could be deployed in other capacities, perhaps to support the rebel
   factions.

   Sending troops, even in a non-combat capacity, into a hot civil war
   where (so the administration claims) CW have been used is an extremely
   risky proposition.

   If even a single American soldier is killed, the US will invade Syria
   and topple Assad before anyone can blink. That's a virtual guarantee.

   And the administration has not answered any questions about this
   possibility--which is a very real one.

       There are a few added bonuses...
       Without international backing, either through the UN or NATO or the
       Arab League, or a judgment from the Hague, it's a unilateral act of
       war, to which Syria has every right to respond.  We can't very well
       complain if they use their anti-ship missiles to close down the
       eastern Mediterranean.  "No fair!" is not a legitimate argument.
       It's a religious war.  Both the Sunni and the Shi'a have been up to
       nasty shit already.  Even if we SAY we're acting on behalf of the
       "ultra-clean" secularist rebels, what we do will be seen as coming
       in on the side of the Sunni.  Picking sides in a religious war
       isn't the way to calm things down or work for peace in the region.
       What's more moral?  A unilateral action with murky motivations -
       are the bombs really meant as a "message" for Iran?  Or pursuing
       legal action at the Hague or the UN, with the result maybe being a
       united front against the use of chemical weapons?
       No to bombs.  They are NOT a solution to a complex problem, they
       only increase the complexity and difficulty of the solution.

       just a reason, to rebut the conclusion that the administration
       doesn't have adequate intel, in light of the totality of the
       remaining evidence.  the whole point is with looking at the fact of
       not showing  or not showing some photo in isolation as indicative
       of anything, without completely exhausting alternative
       possibilities or figuring whether that makes sense.  besides, as
       long as the syrians know we are not going to bomb everything, i
       think there is a secrecy interest in which targets we've flagged.
       i don't purport to read Kerry's mind so don't know why he didn't
       show the photo, but the possibility i raised is at least as
       consistent with the rest of the evidence as anything else, without
       requiring suspension of disbelief.  Whether it's the secretary's
       reason for not showing the photo, and whether that's correct in all

 What's of dispute? ([1327]0+ / 0-)
       There is no dispute Syria has CW and the missiles available for
       delivery.  The intel that pins this down to who ordered and did
       this is the issue and that evidence is likely highly classified for
       damned good reasons.  It's internal communications more than likely
       eavesdropped on or it's stuff leaked out by embedded agents or
       informers.

   are nothing - who is illuminating the maps, labelling the areas of
   control? How can they be accurate, without any real time on the ground
   intel?

   It can all be spun. If there is 'audio'...that can be spun too, or
   taken out of context, mistranslated. This sort of thing has happened in
   the not-too-distant past, involving parties which we are currently
   relying on for intel.

   But I beleive that the evidence is so contrived that only the Congress
   will fall for it. The rest of the world must not be invited in. Why?
   Why, if it's beyond such a "reasonable doubt" to quote FrankenKerry?

       established a precedent that the United States, and only the United
       States, has the moral power and obligation to punish or correct the
       situation.
       Is that really a precedent we want to have? Because while the use

       well.

       By the logic in your second paragraph, those countries opposing

     A covert American program during the Reagan administration provided
     Iraq with critical battle planning assistance at a time when
     American intelligence agencies knew that Iraqi commanders would
     employ chemical weapons in waging the decisive battles of the
     Iran-Iraq war, according to senior military officers with direct
     knowledge of the program.

     Those officers, most of whom agreed to speak on the condition that
     they not be identified, spoke in response to a reporter's questions
     about the nature of gas warfare on both sides of the conflict
     between Iran and Iraq from 1981 to 1988. Iraq's use of gas in that
     conflict is repeatedly cited by President Bush and, this week, by
     his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, as justification
     for ''regime change'' in Iraq.
     ....
     ....

     Though senior officials of the Reagan administration publicly
     condemned Iraq's employment of mustard gas, sarin, VX and other
     poisonous agents, the American military officers said President
     Reagan, Vice President George Bush and senior national security
     aides never withdrew their support for the highly classified program
     in which more than 60 officers of the Defense Intelligence Agency
     were secretly providing detailed information on Iranian deployments,
     tactical planning for battles, plans for airstrikes and bomb-damage
     assessments for Iraq.

     Iraq shared its battle plans with the Americans, without admitting
     the use of chemical weapons, the military officers said. But Iraq's
     use of chemical weapons, already established at that point, became
     more evident in the war's final phase.
     ....

     In early 1988, after the Iraqi Army, with American planning
     assistance, retook the Fao Peninsula in an attack that reopened
     Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf, a defense intelligence officer,
     Lt. Col. Rick Francona, now retired, was sent to tour the
     battlefield with Iraqi officers, the American military officers
     said.

     He reported that Iraq had used chemical weapons to cinch its
     victory, one former D.I.A. official said. Colonel Francona saw zones
     marked off for chemical contamination, and containers for the drug
     atropine scattered around, indicating that Iraqi soldiers had taken
     injections to protect themselves from the effects of gas that might
     blow back over their positions. (Colonel Francona could not be
     reached for comment.)

     C.I.A. officials supported the program to assist Iraq, though they
     were not involved. Separately, the C.I.A. provided Iraq with
     satellite photography of the war front.

     Col. Walter P. Lang, retired, the senior defense intelligence
     officer at the time, said he would not discuss classified
     information, but added that both D.I.A. and C.I.A. officials ''were
     desperate to make sure that Iraq did not lose'' to Iran.

     ''The use of gas on the battlefield by the Iraqis was not a matter
     of deep strategic concern,'' he said. What Mr. Reagan's aides were
     concerned about, he said, was that Iran not break through to the Fao
     Peninsula and spread the Islamic revolution to Kuwait and Saudi
     Arabia.

     Colonel Lang asserted that the Defense Intelligence Agency ''would
     have never accepted the use of chemical weapons against civilians,
     but the use against military objectives was seen as inevitable in
     the Iraqi struggle for survival.'' Senior Reagan administration
     officials did nothing to interfere with the continuation of the
     program, a former participant in the program said.

     Iraq did turn its chemical weapons against the Kurdish population of
     northern Iraq, but the intelligence officers say they were not
     involved in planning any of the military operations in which those
     assaults occurred. They said the reason was that there were no major
     Iranian troop concentrations in the north and the major battles
     where Iraq's military command wanted assistance were on the southern
     war front.

     The Pentagon's battle damage assessments confirmed that Iraqi
     military commanders had integrated chemical weapons throughout their
     arsenal and were adding them to strike plans that American advisers
     either prepared or suggested. Iran claimed that it suffered
     thousands of deaths from chemical weapons.

     The American intelligence officers never encouraged or condoned
     Iraq's use of chemical weapons, but neither did they oppose it
     because they considered Iraq to be struggling for its survival,
     people involved at the time said in interviews.

 Will military force make them listen to us? ([1581]1+ / 0-)

       What affect did military force have on Saddam or the Taliban?
       If the goal is to change Assad's behavior, we'll have to do a lot
       more than drop a few bombs. Like, at a minimum, kill him. As for Al
       Qaeda, even killing them is probably not going to work, since every
       one we kill may be a pitch for new recruits.
       I think there are diplomatic / economic channels that might get
       through to Assad. The problem is that currently they all go through
       Russia.
       Let us all have the strength to see the humanity in our enemies,
       and the courage to let them see the humanity in ourselves.

       what is the diplomatic solution to a state having violated the laws

       The problem isn't the Syrian civil war. The problem isn't Assad as

       have been, addressed diplomatically. The problem is the Assad
       regime's violation of the rules of war and the precedent of the use

       line" of a descent to total war, what is?
       Regardless, my question wasn't rhetorical. I'd like to understand
       your perspective on the use of diplomacy here. I believe in
       diplomacy, I just don't see how it can be used in this situation.
       If you have some ideas, I would be interested- my own operating
       assumption has been that diplomacy cannot work for the problem of
       the violation of the rules of war in the use of chemical weapons.
       If there are diplomatic options I haven't considered, I would
       reconsider my (currently very tepid) support for this intervention.

 I'm not sure ([1766]0+ / 0-)
       what you're referring to as "Geneva 1," but the relevant Geneva in
       my book is the Geneva Protocol (Protocol for the Prohibition of the
       Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of
       Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, 1929). The action by the Syrian
       government was a violation of that Protocol.
       Let's review the debate here. kingfishstew criticized the argument
       for using diplomacy as "ephemeral" for lacking substance. You
       presented

     UN Security Council Resolution 678 of 1990, authorizing the use of
     force against Saddam's Iraq.
       as a "real world example" of diplomacy. I brought up that I didn't
       think a UN Security Council Resolution was an option due to
       Russia's intransigent opposition. You argued that the same was said
       in 1990, we should "try and find out." I stated that the US
       government has indeed tried to get a Security Council resolution
       and provided a link to evidence of the same.
       At that point in the discussion, you stated

     That's trying to authorize military force (0+ / 0-)
     not engage in diplomacy.
     Resolution 678 was not the start of the process. It was the end of
     it.
     The idea that diplomacy is over not 2 weeks after the attack is
     incredibly absurd.
     dailykosradio
     by Armando on Wed Sep 04, 2013 at 11:38:15 AM PDT
       That was odd, considering your original "real world" evidence for
       diplomacy was also a Security Council resolution authorizing
       military force, though you did state that it was the "not the start
       of the process. It was the end of it".
       So, now we were back to the original point by kingfishstew, which
       was that the calls for diplomacy in this situation lack specificity
       and are, in his words, ephemeral. The closest we have to an example
       of real-world diplomacy in this discussion is what you imply as the
       unspecified process of negotiation leading up to Resolution 678 in
       1990.
       At that point, I brought up the point that this situation- that is,
       the violation of the Geneva Protocol and use of chemical weapons-
       does not have apparent diplomatic solutions. Implied in my argument
       was that the 1990 Gulf War was in response to the invasion and
       occupation of Kuwait had diplomatic solutions (attempt to encourage
       the Iraqis to leave, then threaten them to make them leave). These
       diplomatic means were tried until reaching the endpoint of
       resolution 678. However, I believe this situation to be different-
       because the problem is not the occupation of a country, nor even
       the continued civil war, but rather the use of prohibited means of
       war.
       Here is my argument, concisely: the use of chemical weapons in
       Syria by the Assad regime is not a problem with a diplomatic
       solution. We can do nothing, or we can respond punitively.
       I am open to hearing what you see as diplomatic tools that can be
       used in this situation. In my perspective, the two main punitive
       tools available to us are sanctions (which I argued against) and
       military force (direct or indirect, and of varying strength levels.
       I don't believe sanctions will work, so I think the only options
       are do nothing as we have been- and allow continued use of chemical
       weapons and violation of international rules of war until those
       rules truly become completely meaningless- or to strike militarily.
       Despite ample evidence of potential negatives, I think we should do
       the latter. Again, however, I am incredibly persuadable on my
       viewpoint in this situation- are there diplomatic tools that I'm
       not seeing?

 ah ([1775]0+ / 0-)
       Geneva 21 makes more sense.
       Yes, I think the Syrian civil war should be dealt with
       diplomatically.
       But again, I'm not in favor of us interceding in a civil war, I'm
       in favor of upholding international rules of war prohibiting the
       use of chemical weapons, and for punitive measures when a state
       violates said rules. Had chemical weapons not been used, I would
       not be in favor of US action.
       Now, your recent diary does present a much more compelling case.
       The idea that we will violate international norms in order to
       uphold international norms is a pretty convincing argument that we
       shouldn't do this. It would mean a case for war does rest on
       American exceptionalism.
       Hm...I'm back to undecided.
       I can't get away from the idea that the use of chemical weapons is
       a slippery slope (though I do hate slippery slope arguments) that
       requires punitive measures. But unilateral action doesn't support
       international norms either. Still is it the worst thing if states
       are afraid to use chemical weapons due to the possibility that the
       US will launch a punitive strike? Does anyone really fear the UN?
       Will Russia ever truly back punitive action if Syria continues
       using chemical weapons?

   Russia has already vetoed every attempt to get any resolution through
   on Syria. There is little sign that they're going to change their
   stance, given that Putin is still constantly arguing some kind of false
   flag thing.

   But I'm all for keeping trying. I just think that pinning much on
   getting anything through the UN -- I mean, it's probably not going to
   happen.

   Which means moving to other diplomatic approaches is the only likely
   way forward there.

   What I personally have chafed at are people acting as though there has
   been no "real" attempt at diplomacy or international consensus thus
   far. I've been watching things unfold in Syria the whole time, and
   there have been many, many diplomatic attempts by many actors --
   visible ones, which means that the backroom ones have probably been
   even more constant. Assad is uninterested thus far, and Putin is
   solidly backing Assad.

       To me, it is absolutely relevant -- that June veto was after
       evidence of another chemical attack. IIRC, language around that was
       left out at the UN specifically to try to placate Russia into
       finally doing something, and they vetoed anyway.
       But here, then: [2094]Aug 28
       Most real diplomacy doesn't happen in public view. Do you seriously
       think we haven't been talking to Russia?
       It's fine to disagree here, but yes, I think that the diplomatic
       efforts made around all of the bloodbath going on in Syria are
       absolutely relevant to what can be expected in current diplomacy.

   "Russia nixed a British-sponsored Security Council resolution over the
   weekend that voiced "grave concerns" with Syria's military offensive in
   Qusayr. The veto earned a sharp rebuke from State Department
   spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

   The comments come as Bashar Assad's armed forces are rolling back rebel
   forces in the western half of the country. Russia said Monday the Syria
   army should be allowed to wrap up its operation, confirming once again
   that the United States and Russia are on opposite sides of the
   two-year-old conflict that has left some 80,000 people dead.
   "The proposal that the international community should raise its voice
   at a time when the Syrian army is finishing a counter-terrorist
   operation against insurgents who have been terrorizing the population
   of the border-lying Syrian town for several months can hardly be called
   timely," Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said,
   according to the ITAR-TASS press agency."

       Specific reference to them was left out on purpose, to try to get
       Russia on board, but the "grave concerns" in the resolution
       included French evidence of sarin use by Assad at Qusayr.
       That evidence wasn't as easy to pin on Assad at the time, though it
       was probably Assad. It wasn't airtight enough for the UN, but that
       is exactly why "grave concerns" were there, and Russia knew that.

    No.  Will it require considerable upper body strength to twist all
   those arms?  Yes.  Is it lazy?  No.

   Is military intervention the lazy approach?  Yes.  It requires much
   less work on the part of the Administration to give the order to bomb
   than to parlay, argue, fuss, bribe, and otherwise cat-herd the various
   parties into unified action.  I'm not a lazy person, so I naturally
   have a deep disrespect for this approach.  Besides, IT IS AN ACT OF
   WAR.  I don't care if the intention is for a limited military action
   involving aerial robots and stand-off missiles, because war, it never

       From what I can tell, we have been working those angles, too, and I
       hope we continue to do so. War is the last resort for urgent
       situations when all diplomatic efforts on all levels have failed,
       and I don't see that we're there yet, personally.
       But I think the UN -- either authorizing any military action or
       authorizing heavier negotiation tactics -- is an unlikely route
       here, unless we're finding pressure points with Putin in backrooms.
       Which is possible.
       If we can get Putin or another powerful actor in the region to
       pressure Assad into not using the weapons and publicly condemning
       them, maybe there's a way here. I'm dubious, and that would have to
       happen very much out of public view, but I'm closed to nothing at
       this point except ignoring the use of sarin in civilian populated
       areas.

        Recommended by:

       ...we are in agreement.
       I do not wish to ignore the use of sarin against civilians, but
       military force is a wrong choice, in my opinion.  There are many
       reasons I oppose it, both specifically to this circumstance and in
       general.  I'll try to summarize them below.
       In this instance...
       There don't seem to be many good actors on the ground at the
       moment, other than the Kurds to the west.
       The conflict is morphing into a religious war.  We don't want to
       choose sides in such a conflict, since it will exacerbate any
       attempts to make peace or achieve anything diplomatically in the
       region.  A strike at Assad will be perceived as choosing sides.
       Is it really about sarin and Assad?  Some statements from the
       Administration seem to indicate that this is an attempt at sending
       a "message" to Iran.  That's never a good reason to drop bombs.
       Military action won't accomplish anything.  It won't hinder Assad
       in any meaningful way.
       Generally...
       I'm not one for collective guilt.  Bombs, even the advanced robotic
       weapons and GPS-guided missiles, are very blunt objects.  If we
       want to punish Assad, let's punish him, not his people.  We have
       long memories, we can wait, and when we finally can act, let us
       dispense justice on the guilty.
       There are other arguments, but then I'd be writing all day.
       Nice to have a civil discussion on this topic.

       with everything you've written here. I think where we probably
       differ is that sarin, to me, really is a very, very, very red line.
       I do realize that direct chemical warfare has occasionally been
       ignored in the past, and I think that was stupid then, too.
       I have a solid chemistry background, and IMO we do not want a world
       where anybody thinks that the international community is going to
       just sort of sit there and shrug at civilians being gassed with
       sarin. There are very few "WMD's" that actually deserve their
       reputations. This is one of them.
       That doesn't mean that it's a green light to war. It does mean to
       me that the geopolitical stakes go way beyond Syria and the
       particulars of its civil war -- I absolutely think it would be a
       mistake in general to involve ourselves in what's looking to be a
       broad sectarian-religious mess in one of the most centrally
       important areas of the Arab world since the days of the Ottoman
       Empire. I mean, you want a *%^(# mess, here it is.
       I don't know the right answer, at all. I do think that we
       absolutely need to make sure that it's clear that using something
       like sarin will not simply be shrugged at by everybody with any
       power to do anything. I don't want to live in the world where
       that's normal.
       Russia is the best key to this diplomacy, and in that regard, this
       probably couldn't have happened at a worse time in leadership
       there. Putin doesn't really care what anybody thinks about
       anything, so far as I can tell. Russia's politics have been
       hair-raising lately on any number of fronts as it is.
       Thanks for the good discussion on it right back atcha. I really do
       think there are any number of points of view here that are
       completely solid, that I respect and think bring up really
       important thoughts and concerns. I like to hope that many of us can
       be thoughtfully learning from each other while we consider all of
       this.

       giving up its naval bases in Syria? They are very protective of

       them. Or alternatively phrased, how might we ensure Russia gets to
       keep its military assets in Syria even with a possible regime
       change?
       It's the biggest players on the globe with their proxy assets in
       the Middle East that keep it roiling on the edge of chaos. Russian,
       Iran, US, UK, France, China...they all try to advance their causes
       in destabilized and chaotic political situations where a high
       powered police state and increasingly well-armed armed rebels are
       in conflict.
       And we allies have to get our own glass houses in order. Whatever
       the UK's reason for selling chemical gas weapons to Syria, or any
       Middle Eastern interests, undercuts its moral authority to judge
       any other nation or to share in umbrage standing with the US. If we
       don't call the UK, our best Anglo-buddy, out on that, well that's
       the worst loss of face, the worst loss of credibility, the biggest
       lie to our claims of being civilized. That's the red line that
       truly requires our moral attention and that of the UN. Poison gas
       only has one very uncivilized purpose--kill large numbers of people
       of all ages indiscriminatingly. Why not demand this get first
       priority for our justice league?  Pack up those UK arms dealers who
       provided the Serin and Vx gas to Syria and drop them off inside
       Syria's border. Let Syrians sort out what to do with them. Ok, Ok,
       you win. Just take them to The Hague, ASAP.  Next, the UK demands
       back, buys back the remaining stocks of poison gas...  Then we can

   I don't think it should have anything to do with 'American
   credibility'.  We shouldn't be like North Korea, with our actions
   driven by a need to feel we've 'saved face'.  Our actions should be
   driven by what is needful to minimize overall death and destruction.

   I don't believe 'limited strikes' will do any such thing, but will
   instead, if they have any effect at all, merely further draw out and
   extend the conflict, allowing for further death and destruction.

       If Assad were rounding up people and trading them like slaves on
       the open market, it'd be just as important to strike his
       slave-trading facilities for world credibility against (chattel)
       slavery at least as it is for world credibility against nuclear
       weapons. There are just certain things we shouldn't allow to be
       done, at least not as brazenly as Assad is.
       In a way, the non-interventionists arguments remind me a lot, word
       for word, of what the non-resisters (earliest Abolitionists) said
       about Southern Slavery in the 1820-1840s. Well, it's bad, but
       there's nothing anyone can do about it, except tell the Southerners
       they're bad men for keeping slaves. But don't actively help slaves
       escape, because those escapes will inevitably fail and just make it
       worse on the poor slaves. And definately it isn't an issue anyone
       should come to blows over, as they chided people like Lovejoy for
       trying to defend his presses  from pro-slavery mobs.

       think we should bomb the facility?  You do realize it will not be
       Assad who gets killed in the bombing, right?
       Certainly, there are things that should not be allowed.
       Unfortunately, many of those things are things the U.S. is engaged
       in.  And it's not up to the U.S. to unilaterally decide both what
       those things are and what is to be done about them.
       Lowering yourself by comparing noninterventionists to those who
       failed to fight against slavery does not strengthen your argument
       by any means.  In fact, it weakens it considerably.  There are, of
       course, virtually no similarities and it simply makes you look
       small and incapable of arguing your position in a positive manner.

   but I think that letting chemical weapons become the new normal will
   haunt us.

   Bashar Assad is not going to be the last dictator with a rebellion on
   his hands and an arsenal of chemical weapons.

   It's just that I think that whole "symbolic" thing matters more. If you
   have no real good choices, choose one of the options where you don't
   kill anybody.

   This whole situation is terrible and no matter what we do, or don't do,
   or do half-heartedly, Syria will suffer and thousands of innocents will
   die.

   Anyone suggesting that "they" want this war needs to explain how "they"
   caused a massive drought in Syria, followed by the Syrian government
   selling off their wheat reserves because market prices were high. That
   food crisis led directly to the rebellion. No rebellion, no chemical
   weapons.

   The last widespread use of cw gas was Saddam Hussein in the 1980 to
   1988 Iraq/Iran Wars.  A minimum of 25 years has passed before Assad
   used gas on his own people.

   That's pretty far from becoming a new normal.

   The world condemns this use.  The world disagrees about how to enforce
   or address this use of gas.  There is very little sentiment that it is
   acceptable anywhere. (outside Putin's Kremlin, perhaps)

 This is the essential argument ([2503]0+ / 0-)

     The world condemns this use.  The world disagrees about how to
     enforce or address this use of gas.  There is very little sentiment
     that it is acceptable anywhere. (outside Putin's Kremlin, perhaps)

   If the world has decided almost unanimously that chemical weapons are
   never to be used, then what are the consequences if they are? It's a
   tough question but until it's answered we will be placed in the same
   situation in the future. I hope that the hearings will at least address

   I am horrified by the devastation of civilians in Syria.  I am saddened
   by both the nerve agents being used, and the fact that Syrians are
   fleeing their homes to escape this tragedy.  If I thought we could do
   something meaningful, I would say "Bombs away!"

   However, the situation does not lend itself to an easy solution.  The
   rebels aren't really much better than the Syrian government, from our
   point of view, and probably from the average Syrian citizen's as well.
    When you factor in the influx of Al Qaeda amongst the rebel forces,
   our potential pool of allies in the event of a rebel win get far
   shorter.  I don't support Assad's regime, by any means, but neither
   would I welcome an Al Qaeda-infested government to replace him.

   Add in the possibility of an air strike missing the correct target,
   through faulty intel or human error, and my support of an air strike
   goes to nil.

   I hate to say it, but I think our "help" would only hurt.

   If it's so bad for Assad to kill his own innocent people, it's at least
   as bad for us to do it.

   I don't care if you call it a "limited strike." I don't care if you
   hedge and say you won't hit anything but chem weapons depots which are
   fifty miles or more away from major cities. If we call in strikes, we
   will kill innocent Syrians, probably including children.

   I don't support killing innocent Syrians for Assad. I think it's
   obvious that we can't have any real good effect by doing this, and it
   isn't worth the innocent lives we will take to get embroiled in yet

       what the chemicals are)?  Minutes?  Hours?  Days?  I realize there
       would likely be a need for such weapons to be non-dangerous to the
       victors, because otherwise it would be like a nuclear weapon -
       nobody alive, but nobody able to possess the territory either.  It
       doesn't do much good if you can't take the territory.  Just
       wondering how long till people can go back into the area and deal
       with the aftermath.

       Usually, it's not stored as sarin for very long -- most often, they
       would probably mix it within a day or two of use. It wouldn't
       remain very stable mixed for more than a couple of weeks, so far as
       I'm aware. So it'd ultimately depend on whether they have any
       premixed, and how long it has already been there, and so on.
       It turns to nothing majorly awful just reacting with water
       relatively quickly, though. I mean, I would guess somebody could
       get in there with zip risk within a day to a couple of days,
       depending on how much we were talking. But I would have to look up
       reaction rates at various temps and things. I do know that it
       doesn't hang out terribly long.
       The precursors are also somewhat nasty, though in terms of being
       corrosive or so on rather than being nerve agents. It'd depend
       ultimately on how they're stored in relation to each other, too.
       Those are more persistent but less directly dangerous.

   I am really torn.

   Ultimately, I side with staying out, but I did vote for limited
   intervention because it's so uncertain what actually will happen if the
   world does ignore the use of chemical weapons.

   By saying "world" I'm saying that I don't believe at all that the US
   should do this unilaterally.

   So let me ask, Kossacks, what do "we" do if we stay out and Assad uses
   chemical weapons again, killing even more or the same number of his own

     The Minnesota National Guard's 1st Brigade Combat Team, 34th
     Infantry Division, was an important part of the 2007 "surge." As a
     result of the extension of their tour to 16 months in Iraq, and 22
     months overall, the Red Bulls are recognized as having served the
     longest tour of duty in Iraq of any military unit, active or
     reserve.
      The Duluth-based 148th Fighter Wing expertly provided real-time
     surveillance for ground commanders using their Theater Aerial
     Reconnaissance System.

      St. Paul's 34th Combat Aviation Brigade was responsible for
     corps-level helicopter support from 2008-2009.

      In 2009-2010, the 34th Red Bull Infantry Division Headquarters
     provided command and control for 16,000 U.S. military Servicemembers
     operating in nine of Iraq's 18 provinces.

      With the prevalence of improvised explosive devices on the roadways
     in Iraq, the St. Paul-based 133rd Airlift Wing provided critical
     aerial transportation of people, equipment and materiel throughout
     the region.

      In 2011 the 1st Brigade Combat Team mission in Kuwait was the
     largest deployment of Minnesota Guardsmen since World War II. The
     brigad's mission included base management, convoy security, reaction
     forces, and management of specialized units from the Army, Navy and
     Coast Guard. The brigade drove 1.35 million miles and escorted
     25,970 trucks during 480 missions prior to the last U.S. military
     convoy departing Iraq.

     Current operations have troops deployed for Operation Noble Eagle
     (Homeland Security) and Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan).

   [2831]http://www.minnesotanationalguard.org/...

   Note that when the 1st Brigade went back to Iraq and drove those 1.35
   million miles in Iraq and completed 480 mission in Iraq they were
   deployed to Kuwait so the Obama administration did not count them as
   troops in Iraq.

   When they tell me no boots on the ground, I don't believe them.
   Besides, my state's troops are still deployed in Afghanistan.

   "Persuadable" might be a better choice.

   If there were better evidence that Assad was behind the attacks; if

   accomplish; if there were better assurances that a strike would do
   minimal harm to innocent people; if these things could be met, then I

   It's both a travesty and par for the course that the international
   community will sit on its hands.  China and Russia made clear they will
   veto any international action.

   This argument that 'something' has to be done, because we're setting
   precedent when we stop enforcing international law has grown on me over
   the last week.  As a species we banned the use of chemical weapons
   DURING WWI.  Can we really start looking the other way now?   Do we
   seriously want history to show that 100 years after The Great War, we
   sorta just gave up on these enforcing these laws because we lost the
   appetite for human decency?

   The United States spends 42 cents of every military dollar on the
   planet.  With that outsized power comes outsized responsibility.
   Recent experience and military adventurism has not served us well.
   This probably has a 'boy who cried wolf' effect on the public appetite
   for any kind of intervention, no matter the conflict.

   At the end of the day, I feel , and we are all well aware, neither
   option is good, but at least intervention will show that at a few
   countries still respect and want to enforce international laws
   regarding war crimes and human decency.

   Of course we may be breaking international law to enforce these
   important laws... but geopolitics has made this par for the course too.

   With heavy heart, and a level of trepidation,  I have voted for
   intervention.

   Looking at the results, I see this puts me at odds with many of my
   kossack comrades.  I hope my opinion can be respected, just as I
   respect every one of yours.

       The UN was supposed to handle this kind of issue, although the
       problem always existed about what authority it has when dealing
       with internal issues in a sovereign state.  Born out of WWII, the
       idea was to prevent another Hitler, but what if a Hitler-like
       regime executed its own citizens?
       Moreover, it's likely that no one seriously foresaw that the
       Security Council would become so bogged down by politics that it be
       effectively useless in the very situations it was designed to
       prevent and remedy.
       So, if the UN fails to act because of inherent conflicts, does that
       render US intervention null?
       We really need to decide whether we're going to effectively turn a
       blind eye to intra-state atrocities.  If we're going to intervene,
       we need to develop a strategy for such interventions more than a
       few days before acting.
       But what to do about Syria in the meantime?

   Short term I think a military strike is the worst thing they can do.

   Long term I think NO military strike is the worst thing they can do.

   So originally I was leaning towards supporting the strikes.  However, I
   have a nagging feeling that down the road whether the US acts or not
   will make little or no difference to how they are perceived and how
   others act as a result, and so you will simply get the short term pain
   without the long term benefit.  Especially when the proposed actions
   are so tepid.

   I think the US (and the UN preferably) need to act, but preferably
   without actually dropping bombs or firing missiles.  That's just going
   to inflame the Middle East even more even if the actions can be morally
   justified.

   Here's what I ask myself: what is the best course of action that will
   stop the slaughter, and prevent the chemical weapons from being used
   again including in a potentially much larger and more devastating
   attack?  Toppling Assad doesn't guarantee that.  Punishing him doesn't
   guarantee it.  Leaving him alone or threatening to send people to war
   crimes trials doesn't do that.  There are no good options here, and
   this is why I would never want the job as President.

 The pro argument ([3260]0+ / 0-)

   The better argument for intervention is that absent a stiff price for
   the use of chemical weapons, Assad will use them routinely. It's
   impossible for the rebels to protect population centers that support
   them from attack with such weapons.

   Other nations and warlords will see that chemical weapons can be both
   extremely effective and that their use is no longer punished by the
   world community. We'd be looking at mass proliferation as one side in
   each conflict acquires them and their opponents respond in kind to
   deter their use. Eventually the conventions against chemical weapons
   would fall apart, a nightmare scenario.

   If we strike Assad and he responds by continuing to use chemical
   weapons, the consequences won't be nearly as bad. It will be clear that
   he has paid a heavy price for their use and that by using them he has
   effectively seriously damaged his ultimate chance for success in the
   war.

   IF does little or nothing to stop or curtail Assad's future chemical

   outright defeat (by whom?) will bring them to publicly admit facts that
   the world already knows.

   Very glad the Prez agreed to consult Congress.  I believe acting on his
   own is a guaranteed recipe for political damage; thus he needs to act
   in concert with massive agreement from other authorities, to save his
   (and America's) ass, PR wise.  I hope more Euro nations weigh in.

   I also believe the limited strike stated so far could be very
   effective, mostly in light of Prez's handling of Osama assassination
   and its surgical and successful outcome... not to ignore the positions
   of those who questioned his "right" to kill enemies absent due process.

 It's not about chem weapons or kids, it's Iran ([3318]0+ / 0-)

   Unfortunately, the President very publicly drew his "red line" at
   Syria's use of chemical weapons. Personally, I think that was a
   mistake.

   If the U.S. fails to punish Syria in any militarily forceful way, Iran,
   N. Korea and anyone else with a nuclear or other WMD weapons program -
   or aspirations for such a program, will see a weak President who will
   not enforce his tough talk with any meaningful punishments. Without
   fear of U.S. punishment, these country's will have no reason to
   discontinue their pursuit of these programs.

   Another residual complication will be that Israel will be even more
   inclined than they already are to take matters into their own hands
   with Iran.

   The whole situation in Syria is an f'd up minefield for the U.S. and
   the West. I think Obama really misplayed this with his "red line" and
   has made what was a difficult situation nearly impossible.

   The U.S. has to act. And none of those options are good or hold the
   promise of achieving any significant results.

   But none of this is about the use of chemical weapons or the loss of
   1,400 lives. It's about politics and the message it sends to others.

   Recommended by:
          [3322]3goldens, [3323]maryabein, [3324]emal

   People urging intervention miss the context.

   Obama says no regime change, [3325]yet he authorized covert action to
   overthrow Assad over a year ago. The CIA has been [3326]training and
   arming the rebels for at least a year - there are U.S. bases in Turkey
   and Jordan set up for this purpose. It's likely there are already
   special forces on the ground in Syria.

   Our allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar (both despotic monarchies themselves)
   have been funneling billions of dollars into the conflict with our
   tacit approval, sending both weapons and Jihadist fighters into Syria.
   Saudi Arabia reportedly [3327]freed 1,200 death row inmates - rapists,
   murderers, drug traffickers - and forced them to fight against Assad.

   Qatar and Saudi Arabia, of course, have a great deal to gain
   strategically from Assad being gone, since Syria is an important
   transit hub for oil and natural gas. Like the U.S., they will do
   anything to weaken Iran's influence and prevent the rise of the
   so-called "Shiite Crescent."

   The rebels, the people we are arming and funding, have been captured on
   video committing human rights abuses of their own. Torturing prisoners,
   mass killings, [3328]using prisoners as suicide bombers - all of which
   the U.S. has turned a blind eye to. I watched Kerry insist in the
   hearing yesterday that the rebels contain hardly any radical elements
   and are "getting better" - completely divorced from reality. What
   happens once Assad is gone? Will the rebels have access to chemical
   weapons?

   These are not the actions of a country interested in peace and
   protecting human life. A "limited action" for human rights purposes, in
   a violent conflict the U.S. and its allies are helping perpetuate and
   has no plan to resolve, makes little sense.

   And finally, maybe we should look at what happened the last time we
   decided to take military action for "humanitarian purposes." Has anyone
   paid attention to what's happening in Libya? Or is it only when there's
   a chance to bomb a country that we care about the people there?

     Libya has plunged unnoticed into its worst political and economic
     crisis since the defeat of Gaddafi two years ago. Government
     authority is disintegrating in all parts of the country putting in
     doubt claims by American, British and French politicians that Nato's
     military action in Libya in 2011 was an outstanding example of a
     successful foreign military intervention which should be repeated in
     Syria...
     Libyans are increasingly at the mercy of militias which act outside

       They're basing their actions and arguments on intelligence whose
       leaders of said intelligence agencies have a track record of
       blatant misuse and lies! I have no trust in the "just trust us"
       agencies. In addition the leaders of these intelligence agencies
       have voiced they are on board with the action being proposed, and
       many of them are holdovers from the Cheney administration. The same
       Cheney administration who they perfected and raised to an art form,
       stovepiping and cherrypicking of "intelligence" as well as their
       sales pitch for War product. Not saying this necessarily is the
       case in this instance, but reason for my mistrust of anything that
       they tell us is "high confidence".
       That said, it appears from reading this, there is credible
       information that Assad used CW's in this recent attack..but imho
       many reasonable doubts, beyond a reasonable doubt. I also believe
       the record indicates that rebels have used [3339]Used CW's too in

   I'd be willing to shift to supporting intervention in Syria, and to try

   Both of those governments are also guilty of human rights atrocities.
   Our continued friendly posture toward those governments also deeply
   undermines the credibility of US policy in the eyes of most of the
   world.  Removing all three governments would offer a genuine chance to
   reshape the middle east.

   Otherwise, the current proposal is recycled, go-nowhere hand-waving, as

 Against the war in Iraq, for Syrian intervention ([3363]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [3364]Jerry056, [3365]Spit

   But barely. I have read the arguments for and against.

   I'm not pro-intervention all the time. Far from it. I was arrested in a
   civil disobedience action in the lead up to the Iraq war and spent most
   of that week on the streets, protesting. I was against the Bosnian,
   Kosovo and Albanian interventions (though I now believe I was wrong)

   So, here's why I believe what I believe. First, I believe that Assad's
   regime used chemical weapons. It seems clear from the evidence that
   chemical weapons were used and it only makes sense that Assad would
   have used them given the target and the area. I don't believe Obama is
   lying about that.

   Second, I believe that the use of chemical weapons without response is
   unacceptable. It is an international norm, and if one regime can do it
   without response many others will follow. What do international norms
   and laws mean if you can break them with impunity?

   Third, while I would almost always favor UN or international action on
   something like this, Russia's false ignorance and willful intransigence
   in supporting Syria make UN action impossible. Likewise, NATO cannot
   realistically be involved in an area outside their scope and the Arab
   League appears unwilling to do anything other than prop up
   authoritarian regimes.

   So, what I see is that action must be taken and we are the only ones
   capable of taking it (perhaps with French support).

   However, I am swayed by several things. The lack of British support is
   troubling. The potential for unintended consequences is sizable; we may
   end up sucked into a more direct conflict with Syria, or may end up
   sucked into a regional war; we might empower al-Quada, we might replay
   Afghanistan and the Soviets. I dislike war in general; cruise missiles
   and bombs are particularly poorly directed things that cause
   significant collateral damage. It seems that this will strengthen
   Assad's hold over Syria by giving him an external enemy. There seems
   little evidence we can do more than a gesture, and that gesture may not
   "degrade and deter," and may lead us into worse things.

   Currently, I'm 53% in favor, 47% against. I almost put undecided, but
   to me that's a cop-out. If I'm not against it, I'm tacitly supporting
   it. I would be glad to hear opposing arguments that don't hinge on the
   administration  lying or a general no-war-ever argument. The
   proposition that Obama is somehow a neoconservative or implementing the
   neocon agenda is completely absurd. I also dislike the straw man of
   African conflicts unintervened on- I understand we don't and can't
   intervene everywhere, this discussion is about this time, now. I also
   disagree with the notion that "dead is dead"- the use of chemical
   weapons means something. If I can, I'd love to hear from other people
   who consider the use of chemical weapons in violation of treaty and law
   unacceptable, but may not consider US intervention the best way to
   handle it. Fire away.

   First of all, there is no solution and there is no good response.

   If the US and allies don't respond, not only will the slaughter
   continue, but the use of chemical weapons will as well. It will be seen
   as a tacit admission that so long as at least one member of the UN
   Security Council is willing to let their own self-interest keep
   resolutions off the table and there's a potentially high cost to be
   paid by putting troops on the ground, WMDs are a legitimate tool for
   maintaining power.

   If they do respond, there's a strong chance that the attacks do little
   to limit Syria's chemical weapons deployment or deter Assad's will to
   use them, and the gesture will be at best likely meaningless and at
   worst, polorize Assad's support to cause greater suffering.

   If they do respond, there's also the chance that it continues to
   escalate, pulling the US closer to direct intervention on the ground,
   establishing yet another mire in the Middle East which will cost
   greatly in American wealth and lives to endure.

   There is no right answer. Regardless of what the US does, innocent
   people will continue to die on the ground in Syria. That isn't the
   question and it's a silly way to try and weigh it. The question is
   whether or not intervention will prove the less bloody option in the
   future. In every option, innocent people are going to suffer and die.
   How many and for how long is the calculus for this decision, in my
   opinion.

 My Thoughts... ([3377]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   I agree that there's little we can actually DO about the conflict
   without YET AGAIN committing an unreasonable amount of blood and
   treasure. I have supported our 'hands off' policy toward Syria up until
   now for that very reason.

   Conventional warfare, while horrific, is not in and of itself a legal
   'crime of war.' Civilian casualties, the same. In a civil war, civilian
   casualties are much more likely.

   But with the use of chemical weapons, Assad has violated a specific
   international rule.  Rule violators should be punished. (Banks, anyone?
   The Bush administration, anyone?)

   In this case, I think Obama's approach is correct. We are punishing the
   Syrian goverment for the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield. We
   are going to make some strikes, then stop. We're not getting into a
   quagmire but we are enforcing the very important rule not to use
   chemical weapons.

   This will not solve the Syrian conflict. It may help the rebels, it may
   not. But it will let Syria and others know that chemical weapons may
   not be used without consequences.

   I do have two concerns: one, that we'll somehow get sucked in anyway,
   despite Obama's claims that we won't, and two, that Syria will attempt
   some sort of retaliation against Israel in an attempt to make it into a
   regional conflict. So this is not without risk.

   Poison gas is not the same as killing by another means.  It is the same
   as dropping a nuclar bomb, fire bombing a city, sourced earth, or the
   tacits of Gangus Kong (sp?)

   Yes, you can achieve the same effect with conventional weapons, but the
   amount of effort is different.  And that effort is important in the
   calculus of everything else.

   This is also the reverse of asymeteric warfare.  Syria can not
   meaningfully threaten the United States.  And even though there would
   be cost in terms of material, equipment, and most importantly lives,
   the damage caused by the US strike will be determined by what the plan
   is, not what Syria will allow us to do.

   (Long term political issues as well, I know.)

   The US milatry time of involvement will be determined in DC and not in
   the field, that means we can limit the act of war to what "we" think it
   should be.

   A US strike is going to come with a long term cost.  Not acting is also
   going to come with a cost.  Too small an acttack will make it not worth
   the price.  Too large, not worth the back lash.

   I have no idea what the right size is.  But WMDs need a firm response.

   Let's get a scoring in place:

   A. absolutely wrong
   B. sometimes wrong
   C. rarely wrong
   D. rarely good
   E. sometimes good
   F. absolutely great

   Now, let's go through a laundry list of evils, some utterly rejected by
   today's civilized societies, some receiving a pass under specific
   circumstances, others tolerated far more than not.

   I assembled a list based on subheaders on the Human Rights wiki page
   [3398]here adding in a few subcategories where it seemed needful. Some
   redundancies and overlaps are evident already but I'm going to leave
   them in.

   The list is NOT rank ordered, but intended to show the range of "evils"
   (my word) or abuses (theirs) as defined by current thought on human
   rights.

   1. War
   2. Genocide
   3. Employment of WMDs
   4. Possession of WMDs
   5. Ethnic Cleansing
   6. Forced Relocation
   7. Mass Murder
   8. Homicide
   9. Torture
   10. Rape
   11. Sexual Abuse of Children
   12. Child Soldiers
   13. Slavery and Forced Prostitution
   14. Forced Labor
   15. Silencing Dissent
   17. Persecutions of Conscience (religious and ideological, etc.)
   17. Persecutions of Identity (gender, orientation, ethnic, racial,
   partisan)
   18. Restricting Movement
   19. Imprisonment
   20. Disarming Citizens
   21. Drafting Citizens (adults this time)
   22. Destruction/confiscation of housing, land, possessions
   23. Restriction of rights to work, participate in commerce
   24. Maldistribution of wealth (to extent it crowds out those with less
   from being able to function in a market society)
   25. Blocking access to necessities of life (water, food, medical
   attention)
   26. Interfering with Reproductive choice (not just contraception and
   abortion but right to marry and have kids with whoever one pleases)
   27. Arranged/Forced Marriages
   28. Restricting Free Press, Access to Information
   29. Emergency Suspension of Rights for National Security

   Score away, or just reflect on how many, many different ways human
   beings can suck toward one another and accommodate themselves to evil
   and abuse and oppression in their lives and the lives of those around
   them...

   ...and rationalize even worse situations for people that they'll never
   see, or speak with, or meet.

   On the one hand, I just handed pro interventionists a strong foundation
   with that last line: That we can't sleep nights knowing we could
   ameliorate suffering and correct a wrong - and did nothing.

   On the other hand, I just handed anti-interventionists support for the
   contention that the first rule for any physician, even metaphorical
   ones, is "Do not further harm."

   You just have to ask yourself what harms are attached to the likely
   war/not classical war scenarios that are looming ahead for the people
   of Syria and figure out whether or not you really will be sleeping
   better the night after the war/not classical war begins.

   you'd think the reason the public aren't behind military action was
   because the Obama admin had botched the selling of the idea. "The
   public aren't there yet" is how they spun opposition to any bombing.
   Blitzer even asked why Obama hadn't bombed Syria sooner? Then he lobbed
   softballs at McCain for 10 mins.

   So, as far as any action being taken is concerned, I went from being
   55% against, to 70%-80% against, due entirely to CNN's disgusting

   1.  Why Syria when we've let so many other 'wars' go on without getting
   involved for humanitarian reasons?

   -Really?  All or nothing?  We let other people die, so let the Syrians
   die, too?

   2.  Strategic strikes won't do anything.

   -How in the f*ck would you know that?  A simple no-fly zone over Iraq
   completely decimated Saddam's military to where he was a dictator of a
   city, not country, and allowed Bush2 to pummel what was left in one
   day.  After strikes in Libya, Ghaddafi's rule was drastically cut
   short.

   3.  We are not the world's police

   -This is more of the Reagan effect, as in the 'f*ck you all, I got
   mine' attitude.  Yes, we all care about OUR human rights, like the NSA
   spying on our porn activities, but the rest of the world and all those
   unfortunates can go to HELL.

   I really can't see how self-proclaimed 'liberals' wouldn't think twice
   about sitting back and letting this war go on when we could make a
   difference and end the fighting sooner.  Calling them all 'Islamists'
   is a chicken shit excuse for looking the other way.

   I've heard that one a lot, recently. Meteor Blades, Kos, etc. I don't
   get it- seems to lack the nuance I would expect from those folks, who I
   respect. Obviously we don't intervene everywhere, all the time- we
   can't. It isn't an argument for why we shouldn't this time.

   However, I'm not with you on the goals here. Regime change shouldn't be
   our aim. The reason we are getting involved is the violation of
   international norms and the laws of war from the use of chemical
   weapons. A punitive strike will likely deter future use of these
   weapons.

   My belief about the use of violence is that it is appropriate when it
   will decrease the use of violence. Gandhi notwithstanding, there are
   numerous examples of violent intervention preventing further violence.
   Here, violence may prevent some future use of these weapons, decreasing
   overall violence and supporting the movement of the world towards
   international law.

   I only wish we could do it in an international forum with backing.
   Someday perhaps we will do away with the archaic

       (Iran, Russia, China, Hezbollah, and of course Assad).
       There's so many angles at play, its mind boggling, but I do believe

   Some say that Assad is winning and must be cut down to size and the US

   Assad's Alawite sect to defect. They are getting out while they can.
   Alawites, a tiny minority, are scared to death. Those remaining will
   fight to the end. Many Syrian Christians fear the rebels who include
   various jihadist groups. Nobody can win this civil war, just like in
   Lebanon.

   The debate is about political posturing and pseudo-events. Many
   Americans wonder whether we are governed by cyborgs, idiots or
   pathological liars (and why the media gives us only slogans). Lebanon
   has been without a central government for 5 months, Parliament can't
   meet. Hezbollah can't govern but won't let others govern. The US and
   our PR obsessed 'leaders' should worry about what will happen in Egypt
   and about the possible development of a large failed multi-state
   including both Syria & Lebanon.  Hezbollah is deeply involved in both
   countries.

   Neither the US nor Israel know how to turn back Hezbollah. The Israelis
   can keep jihadists out of their country and obliterate sites that
   launch missiles,  but only those who live in Lebanon and Syria can get
   rid of Hezbollah. They are hampered by the many foreign fighters in
   both countries. Shock and awe doesn't work in asymmetrical warfare, but

 Geneva Protocols ([3575]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [3576]Zek J Evets

   John Kerry did an able job during hearings today of staking the
   Administration's initiative to strike Assad on defending the veracity
   of the 1925 Geneva 'Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of
   Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods
   of Warfare'.

   In sum, the argument stipulates such international conventions are
   reduced to mere policy abstractions if not backed by force when
   violated.  By all accounts I've been able to locate, outside of World
   War II, the only known use of poison, or 'noxious' gases, was carried
   out by Sadam Hussein.  This bolsters the Administration's position by
   eliminating arguments that poison gas use has been unevenly sanctioned
   (Hussein's regime was eventually crushed through military force, though
   admittedly not specifically for that reason.)

   It's a decent argument.  Kos, you served, as did I (USMC), and damn
   well know how horrific toxins like Sarin and VX (and cyanide gas,
   mustard gas, etc.) are.  The Administration's point is that chemical
   warfare is particularly cruel and terrifying, hence the adoption of a
   specific international protocol to ban their use.  Most civilians are
   probably unaware of this, but a variety of weapons are actually
   outlawed under international law (shotgun shells filled with glass
   coming most readily to mind), so land warfare is not quite the
   free-for-all some here seem to imagine.

   I've consistently opposed our Bush initiated wars, but strongly support
   the Geneva Protocols.  As a guy who packed MOPP gear, gas mask,
   automatic atropine and valium injectors during the Gulf War and was
   subjected to rocket fire, I really can't do otherwise.  I'd like to see
   this nation vigorously and consistently support international laws
   intended to suppress at least some of the barbarity to which men
   subject other men.  I'd like to see us do it even when oil isn't the
   obvious, underlying concern.  However, I won't let past
   disappointments, or Syria's proximity to the oil patch, undercut my
   support for the Administration's current request, for authorization of
   the use of force, in support of these important protocols.

   Humans need to be discussing, presenting ideas, doing research, and

   When we humans evolved our science and technology to the point of
   taking the primal powers of the universe, the god-like powers of atomic

   evolve a moral-ethical consciousness to match the physical god-like
   powers.

   Either we evolve morally, or we assure the death of many life forms on
   the planet, including homo-not-so-sapiens.

   Therefore, in light of the imperative to evolve morally, I must say,

   Even debating possible military intervention is a page out of the past.

 Syria and international law ([3587]0+ / 0-)

   The doctrine of humanitarian intervention holds that one state has the
   right to intervene militarily to protect population in another state. A
   United States military court recognized as much at Nuremberg.
   [3588]http://www.loc.gov/... p. 981-982. The doctrine does not require
   action.  But it would legitimize punishment for use of chemical
   weapons.

   The doctrine of reprisals allows the taking of otherwise unlawful
   action to punish and deter violations of the law of war. In World War
   II, for example, Germany put Canadian POWs in chains, and the Canadians
   retaliated by doing the same to German POWs. Reprisals are not allowed
   against civilians and civilian objects, but that leaves a wealth of
   legitimate military targets. This doctrine, too, would legitimize
   strikes in response to use of chemical weapons.

   Neither of these doctrines amounts to an obligation, however. They are
   permissive, that is, they legitimate an attack on Syria, facts
   permitting, but do not require it. I say "facts permitting," because
   there has to be strong and valid evidence in order to invoke them. They
   aren't a carte-blanche.

   The use of poison gas has been against international law since 1900, if
   not earlier. That was entry-into-force date of treaties banning use of
   "poison or poisoned arms" and missiles delivering "asphyxiating or
   deleterious gases" in international armed conflict.
   [3589]http://bit.ly/... (Art. 22) and [3590]http://bit.ly/... . A 1907
   treaty banned nearly identical to one of those earlier ones, use of
   "poison and poisoned weapons" [3591]http://bit.ly/... (Art. 23). Key
   parts of the two major treaties are known loosely as the "Hague
   Regulations," not "The Geneva Convention." Turkey and France ratified
   all three agreements. Turkey and later France controlled the territory
   that became Syria. Therefore, Syria, too, is bound by those
   conventions.

   Many allude to a chemical weapons treaty of 1925, calling it the Geneva
   Convention. Actually, it's the Geneva Protocol of 1925, and the "Geneva
   Conventions" are separate treaties entirely. The Protocol didn't
   actually ban chemical weapons, but it confirmed earlier treaty
   provisions that did (see above) and extended the ban to
   "bacteriological" weapons.

   In any event, the International Committee of the Red Cross found that
   there is now a rule at customary international law which prohibits use
   of chemical weapons, even in non-international armed conflict.
   [3592]http://bit.ly/.... The customary-law status of this rule makes it
   binding on Syria.
