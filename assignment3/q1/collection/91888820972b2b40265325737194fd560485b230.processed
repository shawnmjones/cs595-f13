[23]Three things everyone assumes about the Virginia governors race that may
actually be wrong

   Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe
   With just over three months to go in the 2013 elections (for the
   uninitiated ... yes, we have elections this year), the bulk of the
   interested observers and election junkies are casting their eyes to the
   South.

   Sure, Chris Christie is just one bloviation away from making any
   election competitive, and Democrat Barbara Buono is [30]amassing the
   resources to take advantage of it when he does. But, in the state of
   Virginia, a gubernatorial race that has been a polling tossup all year,
   between two strong personalities, is what is garnering the lion's share
   of the attention.

   Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the one-time head of the Democratic National
   Committee, is going heads-up with Republican state attorney general Ken
   Cuccinelli. McAuliffe has been this way once before, having run [31]a
   surprisingly distant second to Creigh Deeds in the Democratic
   gubernatorial primary in 2009. Cuccinelli ascended the ladder in a
   fairly conventional manner, moving up from the state legislature to the
   position of attorney general by easily defeating Steve Shannon in 2009
   (his margin having been larger than any of his prior state legislative
   victories).

   Both candidates are drawing a lot of political heat in this off-year
   election. So much so that a lot of folks are making assumptions about
   the race, some of which may be off the mark by a foot or two. Follow me
   below the fold for four assumptions that it seems like a lot of folks
   are making that are quite possibly errant.

   ASSUMPTION #1: Voters really don't like their choices here.

   If there is a single article of faith about this Virginia gubernatorial
   election, it is the fundamental assumption that this is the "meh"
   election: a choice between two candidates that, for all intents and
   purposes, no one particularly loves.

   In that regard, it is rather telling that one could practically see
   partisans from both sides of the ledger salivating when it became clear
   that McAuliffe and Cuccinelli were the presumptive nominees.

   There is some data that would appear to bear this out. According to
   PPP's latest poll, [32]both candidates had underwater favorability
   ratings, with Cuccinelli looking markedly worse (32/47) than McAuliffe
   (34/36). However, those numbers are owed in part to the fact that, even
   as the bulk of voters are still giving the election minimal attention,
   both of these candidates are already absolutely reviled by partisans
   from the other team. McAuliffe, among Republicans, actually does as
   nearly as bad (9/57) as Cuccinelli does with Democrats (12/66).

   However, as it happens, this week we also received some data that is,
   at a minimum, mildly contradictory to this "a pox on both your
   candidates" thesis.

   The [33]Quinnipiac poll, released on Thursday, had identical margins
   (and nearly identical toplines) as the PPP poll that was released
   earlier in the week. Both polls had Democrat Terry McAuliffe staked to
   a four-point edge over Republican Ken Cuccinelli. The only difference
   in the head-to-head trial heats was that both candidates scored a few
   points less on the PPP survey (owed almost certainly to the inclusion
   of Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis in PPP's poll, but not the Q
   poll).

   Where the two pollsters diverged, and fairly substantially, was on the
   favorability ratings for both candidates. Whereas the aforementioned
   PPP numbers for both McAuliffe and Cuccinelli ranged from
   mediocre-to-awful, the Quinnipiac poll had both men in net-positive
   territory on their favorability numbers. The divide between the two
   candidates was still present, and almost identical: McAuliffe, in terms
   of net favorability, ran about a dozen points "warmer" than Cuccinelli
   (in this case, specifically, ten points better, with McAuliffe at a net
   plus-11, and Cuccinelli at a net plus-1).

   Digging into the numbers here doesn't give us many answers. There is no
   obvious shift among party ID, for example, that explains the
   discrepancy. The most obvious thing appears to be that there were a
   considerably larger pool of voters in the Q poll without a strong
   opinion of the candidates. 70 percent of PPP's respondents either
   judged McAuliffe favorably or unfavorably, but only 49 percent of
   Quinnipiac's respondents were willing to do the same.

   Which is another reason to be potentially skeptical of the "everyone
   hates the candidates" thesis. Both candidates (McAuliffe more so than
   Cuccinelli) are still at least partially undefined. That gives them the
   potential for "upside" as they spend their campaign coffers trying to
   define themselves.

   Of course, the converse of that is that their opponents can also rush
   in and define them before they can define themselves. Which means that
   the "meh" election could very well still be a real thing, potentially.

   Which leads us to ...

   ASSUMPTION #2: The Libertarian candidate will be a factor in November.

   If you buy a lot of stock in the first assumption, then it logically
   follows that one might believe that the election's outcome could be
   swung by a 30-something NoVa lawyer by the name of Robert Sarvis.

   Sarvis is the nominee of the Libertarian Party, and he polled [34]at 7
   percent in the PPP poll released earlier this week. A [35]Roanoke
   College poll this week, which had the rather sketchy topline of
   Cuccinelli +5, had Sarvis similarly in the mid-single digits.

   What's more: There is at least a little precedent for the scenario of a
   third-party candidate playing a pivotal role in a statewide race in
   Virginia. The year was [36]1994, and the candidate (Marshall Coleman)
   scored 11 percent of the vote, which allowed Democratic incumbent Sen.
   Chuck Robb to survive the 1994 GOP onslaught with just 46 percent of
   the vote (the execrable Oliver North, the GOP nominee that year, came
   in with 43 percent).

   So, in a close election (and nearly everyone presumes it will be
   close), could Sarvis make the difference?

   Perhaps, but it doesn't seem all that likely.

   For one thing, while 1994 does tell a story of a third-party candidate
   being a legitimate player amid two unloved major party candidates,
   there is a key distinction to be made here: Marshall Coleman was a
   known quantity, with nearly universal name recognition from the outset.
   In short, Coleman was a political player long before his independent
   bid for the Senate. He had famously run for governor on the Republican
   ticket in 1989 (losing to Democrat Douglas Wilder), and had been the
   state's attorney general before that. Furthermore, Coleman secured a
   number of major-league endorsements as a third-party candidate,
   primarily from mainstream Republicans appalled by their party's
   selection of North as the nominee.

   Sarvis will enjoy none of those things. He has run for elective office
   before: he ran for the Virginia state Senate in 2011. And [37]he was
   soundly defeated by veteran Democratic incumbent Dick Saslaw 62-36. He
   has scant name recognition, and it looks like he will [38]lack the
   resources to build it (he had raised just $36,237 through May).

   And about those slightly respectable poll numbers? Well, there could
   well be some connective tissue between 1994 and 2013 here, but not in a
   way that is amenable to the Libertarian candidate. Coleman won 11
   percent of the vote, but he polled better than that in virtually every
   poll conducted during the 1994 cycle.

   Veterans of Daily Kos Elections and other electoral junkies in good
   standing have long known this to be somewhat of an ironclad rule of
   polling: Third-party candidates rarely run as well as they poll. The
   "wasted vote" dilemma is a real phenomenon, and it manifests itself in
   election after election.

   So, perhaps if the race comes down to 1-2 percentage points of margin,
   Robert Sarvis could play a spoiler role. It is unclear, though, for
   whom he would be spoiler (he drew pretty evenly from both candidates,
   based on the 2012 presidential preferences among Sarvis voters). So,
   his value to the election, barring implosion by one or both major-party
   candidates, seems limited.

   ASSUMPTION #3: E.W. Jackson will be a millstone around Ken Cuccinelli's
   neck

   Let's stipulate one thing: Republican E.W. Jackson, the nominee for the
   office of lieutenant governor, is legitimately [39]batshit. When the
   irreplaceable Daily Kos writing institution better known as Hunter can
   do a multiple-installment feature on one candidate, you know that
   you've hit a goldmine.

   As Jackson's ... ahem ... eccentricities became better known, the bulk
   of the political press covering the 2013 elections chalked off his
   prospects for election. However, that has not necessarily been borne
   out in recent data. The [40]PPP poll had Democrat Ralph Northam leading
   Jackson, but only by seven points. The [41]Roanoke College poll had it
   even closer, with Northam clinging to a two-point lead.

   It's not that Jackson is accepted by Virginia voters, mind you. It is
   that he is essentially unknown. PPP had his fav/unfav at an ugly 15/28,
   but that still means the majority of voters do not have a concrete
   opinion of him. The Quinnipiac poll, mirroring their gubernatorial
   poll, found a lot more voters on the fence, as a whopping 81 percent of
   voters did not wish to share an opinion on Jackson.

   This might be hard for some of us to understand or accept, but that
   plays into an often under-discussed phenomenon in American politics:
   The chasm between the depth of political information consumed by
   political junkies (like ourselves) and the depth consumed by the
   average voters, even during an election. In other words, we all know
   about Jackson and his forehead-slapping antics, but the average voter
   in Virginia does not. And may never do so, unless either (a) Ralph
   Northam marshals enough resources in a downballot race to finance a big
   information campaign or (b) the media takes an outsized interest in a
   downballot race, even at the expense of offering relatively less
   coverage of a tossup gubernatorial race. Option (a) is possible, but
   option (b) is comparably unlikely.

   Lots of folks (and not just those on the left end of the spectrum) have
   long assumed that Cuccinelli will be hamstrung with a ticket-mate that
   seems to be completely unelectable in any state committed to ... well
   ... sanity. But for Jackson to be unelectable, there needs to be a
   universal knowledge among Virginia voters that he is unelectable. That
   could still happen, of course. But the data shows that it hasn't
   happened yet. And, it goes without saying: an anonymous E.W. Jackson is
   the best outcome that Ken Cuccinelli could hope for.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [61]Civil

   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([80]California, [81]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these

   because they arent running on a ticket together.

   One can vote Northam AND Cuccinelli, and my guess is that is what many
   will do.

   I do think Jackson's views dont get a lot of attention until the fall
   when the race starts to heat up. Maybe that causes some awkwardness for
   KC, but I doubt it. That said, I think Jackson easily loses the Lt. Gov
   race.

       Humans in some form have been around for at least 600,000 years. We
       stopped being hunter-gatherers maybe 5,000 years ago. Our brains
       are still mostly hunter-gatherer. That means we respond to
       narratives and personalities much more deeply than to logic.
       Those are the rules of the game. The only question is: do we want
       to win? If so, then we nominate candidates with appealing
       personalities. Fortunately people with smarts and morals can also
       have appealing personalities. Though it does narrow the options.

       he's accomplished in elected office, from state assembly to city
       council.

   ...in comments myself on DKE in recent weeks.

   No it's not clear either TMac or Cooch is damaged goods with the
   general electorate.  PPP and Q-poll contradict on their favorable.
   Earlier polls by both and also by WaPo showed such high undecided that
   it was too early to say either had a clear public image.  I've said for
   awhile they could go into the election with intact public images.

   And it's a foregone conclusion the Libertarian won't matter.  I don't
   know why people entertain this, it's the same as people insisting last
   year that Virgil Goode could matter in the Presidential race.  Minor
   candidates never do anything in Virginia.  Perot in '92 and '96 was the
   only one to register in my adult life, and he underperformed
   significantly in Virginia compared to the nation as a whole.

   With Jackson, it's a given that he doesn't singularly drag down Cooch,
   and perhaps doesn't even contribute to such a thing, but it's at least
   slightly more ambiguous.  There can be a synergy for a political party
   where several candidates with similar problems sink together, and while
   Jackson is in another league with Cooch and Obenshain, their
   ideological and policy positions are close enough to potentially hurt
   them all together in a way that doesn't necessarily show up in polling,
   but just sours voters on the party as a whole.  Mostly Steve is right
   here, but Jackson has the potential to hurt on the margins.

   McAuliffe clearly has a small edge over Cuccinelli right now, but
   undecided still are high which keeps it a tossup.  I'll feel better
   when polling is showing something more like 46-42, rather than 41-37.
   If we're still up with undecideds down to around 10%, then we're in
   good shape.

       this. It's all focused on McDonnell. Granted that the current
       governor showed a startlingly high level of corruption and that the
       amount of money & gifts he graciously accepted from the
       fako-natural-medicine company dwarfs what Cuccinelli did. Still,
       Cuccinelli took money and bought & sold stock in the company in a
       way that looks suspiciously like insider trading. They put Martha
       Stewart in jail for that -- why is Cuccinelli sailing along as
       though he has been untouched by the scandal?

   (PREAMBLE): Even though McAuliffe has never won any political race of
   his own and even though his name is a household word among a huge swath
   of the over-50 crowd in the DC metro area, he only nabbed the VA
   primary nod by virtue of the fact that he was the only Dem to submit a
   candidate's petition.  How unusual is that for a non-incumbent!!!
   Nonetheless, his margin of victory was zero (and yes, that's his best
   showing to date!).

   McAuliffe is a terrible candidate because he's a polling disaster and
   because he comes across like a network marketing guru (I've seen him at
   his huckster-best, in person, and [585]wrote about it), but also
   because he's a consummate money-grubbing insider and, no matter how
   hard he washes, he can't out that [586]damn spot.

   Any real Democrat worth his or her salt should be wiping the tarmac
   with Cooch.  [587]He's got the Gov's doo doo all over his wing tipseven
   though he's just today awkwardly joined the chorus for McDonnell's
   head.

   Any real Democrat would be laughing already, starting to make policy
   and gubenatorial mansion decorating decisions. McAuliffe is saying
   ardent prayers that the most accurate polling outfit of the last cycle
   is way off base.

   Perhaps McAuliffe should help Virginia voters get more acquainted with
   Jackson. Yes, it's not, strictly speaking, his race. But to the degree
   people get to like Northam better, perhaps they'll just get out to the
   polls. Once you're there it's as easy to vote for two Democrats as to
   vote for one.

   There were THREE Democratic candidates in the primary, and McAuliffe

   Which, of course, he did.

   This time I guess nobody wanted a repeat performance, so the first

   That's right, the black ministers are endorsing a Republican.

   Next door in Pennsylvania, the Republican Party is making it harder for
   the black ministers congregations to cast their ballots, but in NJ, the
   black ministers are endorsing Christie.  They are protesting the death

       With all of the protests going on around the country over the
       immoral ruling in the Trayvon Martin case, perhaps activists in New
       Jersey should get Christie to give his own insights on the Trayvon
       Martin case.  I am sure he thinks the jury was just fine, because
       so many people feel the same way, frightening as it seems.  But,
       lets put pressure on him.  (These minsters need to hear from their
       congregations too!)
       Whenever a loudmouthed bully, Christie for example, is seen as
       being invincible, he or she usually falls apart at some point and
       we are all left to wonder what was the big deal in the first place.
        So, we might as well start the process now.
       I'm not saying that Christie is a pushover, he isn't, but, we have
       to at least give him a run for his money (and his big mouth).

       Howard Dean's 50 state strategy (which in a perfect world was
       touted as being represented in every county which, FWIW, is what
       Obama also essentially did) ultimately can overturn overlooked
       districts or counties which are assumed to be in the bag by
       Republicans. Nationally or statewide. Dean's strategy proved to be
       the difference between GOP running Congress and a wave election
       that went the other way. You can afford to lose a big state if you
       pick up a few others not expected to be a Colorado, a Nevada, a
       Florida.
       Don't forget, Mark Twain brilliantly pointed out that if you don't
       like a particular political party just give them about 50 years to
       become the one you like. I won't sneeze at 90% in SF. It's all good
       wherever we can get votes including holding on to SF and gaining
       ground in Utah. Spending everywhere holds on to established ground

   I've felt all this year that the sleepiness of this race is somewhat

   MacAuliffe has run warm positive bio spots and not much else so far -

   is waiting til early fall to destroy Cuccinelli with embarassing quotes
   and negative ads - which he can run in much greater number than Cooch.

   Then finish up with warm and fuzzy in October.
