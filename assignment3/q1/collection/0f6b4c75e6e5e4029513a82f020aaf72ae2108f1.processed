   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * The best view of the Perseid meteor shower is after midnight until
       just before sunrise
     * The annual sky show happens when Earth passes near Comet
       Swift-Tuttle's path
     * Bright streaks are "interplanetary dust" burning up as it collides
       with our atmosphere
     * The meteor show is entertainment for most, but a research chance
       for NASA

   Editor's note: Calling all stargazers. [52]Share your photos of
   celestial happenings near you.

   Los Angeles (CNN) -- A celestial fireworks show peaks Monday and
   Tuesday as Earth passes though the dust of a comet's tail.

   Humans around the world have witnessed the Perseid meteor shower every
   August for at least 2,000 years, with dozens of meteors streaking
   across the sky each hour.

   Your view is best after midnight until just before sunrise. Get away
   from city lights, if possible, for the full effect. A waning crescent
   moon means less light in the sky to compete with the meteor display.
   Next year's show will be dimmed by a full moon.

   The annual sky spectacular happens when our planet's orbit around the
   sun passes near Comet Swift-Tuttle's path, which goes by every 130
   years. The last close encounter with the comet was 20 years ago, but it
   left grains of dust in its wake.

   The bright streaks you see are "interplanetary dust" burning up as it
   collides with our atmosphere at about 133,000 mph, according to NASA
   micrometeoroid expert Diego Janches. "The fragments are either remnants
   from the solar system's formation, or they are produced by collisions
   between asteroids or comets from long ago."

   "Each such fragment is approximately the size of a dime, but the more
   constant, sporadic meteoroids have been around much longer, breaking
   down over time into tiny fragments only about as wide as a piece of
   human hair," according to NASA.gov.

   While the meteor show is entertainment for most, it is a research
   opportunity for Janches and other NASA scientists. They'll use radar
   systems around the globe to watch the fragments of sodium, silicon,
   calcium and magnesium enter the atmosphere.

   "The small meteoroids feed the atmosphere with all these extra
   materials," Janches said in a NASA.com posting. "They come in, release
   metallic atoms that get deposited in the mesosphere and then get pushed
   around from pole to pole by the general global circulation. So by using
   the metals as tracers, you can answer some important questions about
   the general composition and movement of the atmosphere."
