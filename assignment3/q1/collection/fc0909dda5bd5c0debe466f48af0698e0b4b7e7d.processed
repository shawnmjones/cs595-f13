[22]Rick Perry forgets where he is

   Rick Perry is apparently [31]now wearing horn-rimmed glasses, perhaps
   an effort to give him the perception of gravitas ahead of his 2016
   presidential campaign. But that didn't stop him from saying this on
   Saturday--in New Orleans, Louisiana:

     If Perry looked a little different, some things don't change - like
     recalling numbers or geography. Touting Texas, Perry declared,
     "There are many other states that embrace those conservative values,
     the approach we've taken over the years. I'm in one today -
     Florida."

     "We're in Louisiana," someone shouted.

   To which Perry responded:

     I know. And I said that.

   Nope, he didn't say that. But in his defense, it might not be entirely
   his fault. Those new glasses he got--maybe he just needs a new
   prescription.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [43]Tagging tips - [44]Search For Tags - [45]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [46]Civil
   Rights, [47]Community, [48]Congress, [49]Culture, [50]Economy,
   [51]Education, [52]Elections, [53]Energy, [54]Environment, [55]Health
   Care, [56]International, [57]Labor, [58]Law, [59]Media, [60]Meta,
   [61]National Security, [62]Science, [63]Transportation, or [64]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([65]California, [66]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Rogers, who did "everything that Fred Astaire did, but backward and on

   Now, apparently, he just wants to do everything backward.  He's
   abandoned the heels, and, mindful of Dorothy Parker's admonition that
   "men don't make passes at those who wear glasses"  he's cleaning up his
   image in another way.  However few people beyond the FOX talking heads

 RICK PERRY IS A NINCOMPOOP! ([921]0+ / 0-)

   The 2016 presidential election is a mere speck on the political
   horizon, yet Governor Rick Perry, in pre-campaign mode, is already
   regaling the electorate with examples of his stupidity. Mistakes such
   as confusing Florida with Louisiana don't help to elevate his public
   image as an ignoramus. How could he make such a geographical faux pas
   in the first place? I mean, all he has to do is remember that Florida
   is the state shaped like a handgun. Certainly, even a moron like he
   should be able to employ a simple word association trick to recall the
   Florida/gun thingy!

   If Perry plans to remain in the presidential race for the long haul,
   the late-night TV talk show hosts will have a field day milking his
   comedy stylings for all they're worth. This guy doesn't even have to
   TRY to be funny. He just IS funny! In fact, joke writers should send
   him royalty checks for the comic fodder he's sure to provide. (Could he
   possibly have early onset Alzheimer's?)

   There are three reasons why I can't stand Rick Perry: (1) He's far too
   dense to even consider a run for the presidency, which is an insult to
   the voters' intelligence; (2) Perry has that Texan gun nut philosophy
   regarding Second Amendment rights; and (3) Duh... I can't remember what
   the third thing is. Er... Um... Can somebody give me some help here?
   Does anyone else remember what that third one was?

   Perry's dumbassery has become the stuff of legend. (Is "dumbassery"
   even a word? If not, it SHOULD be in Webster's Dictionary, with Perry's
   picture beside it!) Wearing horn-rimmed eyeglasses in an attempt to
   project a more serious, thoughtful and intelligent public persona is an
   exercise in futility that is sure to be an abject failure. In fact,
   it's akin to the proverbial "putting lipstick on a pig" comparison! The
   only reason he opens his mouth is to change feet. When Rick Perry
   speaks, hilarity ensues.
