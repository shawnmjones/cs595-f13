Officials: Obama to tap ex-Bush official as next FBI chief

   By Joe Johns. Jim Acosta and Greg Botelho, CNN
   updated 11:10 AM EDT, Thu May 30, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: A GOP senator questions Comey's work in the hedge fund
       industry
     * James Comey could replace Robert Mueller as FBI director
     * He was deputy attorney general in President George W. Bush's
       administration
     * Officials said he "vigorously opposed" a surveillance program and
       threatened to quit

   (CNN) -- President Barack Obama plans to nominate James Comey to
   replace Robert Mueller as FBI director, officials familiar with the
   nomination process said Wednesday.

   Comey is a former prosecutor who worked in New York and Virginia, where
   his caseload included terrorism, organized crime and fraud
   prosecutions, the latter including executives from WorldCom, Adelphia
   and Imclone, [41]an official biography notes.

   He served as a deputy attorney general in President George W. Bush's
   administration beginning in 2003.

   Comey[42] testified to a Senate committee in 2007 that he considered
   resigning his high-profile administration position over a disagreement
   about the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program.

   That happened in 2004, when he was acting attorney general while John
   Ashcroft was hospitalized following emergency gall bladder surgery.
   Government officials had told CNN that Comey had "vigorously opposed"
   aspects of the warrantless wiretapping program and refused to sign off
   on its continued use.

   Comey's opposition prompted then-White House chief of staff Andrew Card
   and then-White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales to visit Ashcroft, the
   attorney general, in the hospital. Comey was in the room at the time,
   and he recalled later that "I thought I had just witnessed an effort to
   take advantage of a very sick man."

   The program was reauthorized the next day without a Justice Department
   signature, and Comey prepared a letter of resignation, he recalled. But
   he didn't turn it in, staying at the Justice Department until 2005.

   From there, Comey worked as a senior vice president and general counsel
   for the aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin. More recently,
   he had been general counsel at the Connecticut-based money management
   firm Bridgewater Associates.

   Currently, Comey is a board member of HSBC Holdings and a Hertog Fellow
   in national security law at Columbia University's law school, his
   [43]profile on the school's website says.

   Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary
   Committee, said he hadn't heard anything from the White House about
   Comey's nomination. That said, the Iowa Republican lauded Comey for
   having "a lot of experience on national security issues, ... and (he)
   has shown integrity in dealing with these matters."

   "But if he's nominated, he would have to answer questions about his
   recent work in the hedge fund industry," Grassley said, referring to
   Comey's time with Bridgewater Associates. "The administration's efforts
   to criminally prosecute Wall Street for its part in the economic
   downturn have been abysmal, and (the FBI) would have to help build the
   case against some of his colleagues in this lucrative industry."

   If nominated and approved by Congress, Comey will replace the man who
   will have led the FBI for the past 12 years -- officially starting the
   job days before the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and later seeing
   the agency through terrorism and other high-profile cases.

   Mueller's term had been set to expire in September 2011 -- per the 10
   years that FBI directors typically serve -- but, at Obama's request,
   Congress approved a two-year extension. He's now scheduled to step down
   in September.
