Vote for gun reform now central to race for highway superintendent

   In the first federal election after the Newtown shootings, the issue of
   gun reform and alliance with the NRA may well have [5]turned the
   congressional primary last week in Illinois. Here in New York State, we
   are about to have what [6]activists against gun reform [7]are calling
   the first barometer [8]on the issue since Governor Andrew Cuomo signed
   new restrictions on guns and ammunition into law.

   The race for highway superintendent  -- in the town of Brookhaven, in
   Suffolk County, out on eastern Long Island -- features Brookhaven
   Councilwoman Kathleen Walsh against Assemblyman Dan Losquadro. In
   theory, [9]it concerns matters like [10]snow plowing. On the ground, it
   has become a referendum on gun policy. As a Republican member of the
   legislature, [11]Losquadro voted for the Cuomo gun reform bill. Since
   then, people who object to that vote have flooded his Facebook page
   with comments railing against him as a traitor. They've also got a page
   going called "[12]Dan Losquadro Is Dishonest." (Update: To be clear,
   the Facebook page admin [13]disavows the shooting video above.)

   The vote happens tomorrow. Newsday notes that turnout for the special
   election could be low enough that any given special interest could
   swing the outcome.

   Up top, a YouTube clip of people shooting up a Dan Losquadro campaign
   sign. UPDATE: After I posted this, the owner of the YouTube clip made
   it private -- his explanation is [14]in the comments. After the jump, a
   flyer sent to us by Michael Hershkowitz ([15]through our Facebook
   inbox).

   Wednesday update: [16]Losquadro wins.
     __________________________________________________________________


   Kathleen Walsh is a former Republican [17]now running (pdf) on the
   Independence Party and Democratic Party lines. As with Losquadro, local
   Newsday describes Walsh as a supporter of Second Amendment rights. That
   seems to be part of the pitch against her in this flyer. Hershkowitz
   writes: "[I]t's a mystery why the full political machine is in effect
   for this relatively small special election.  I'm certainly sick of the
   daily robocalls, flyers and commercials."

   NRA highway safety proposal - Every car on the highways and byways of
   New York must have one hand gun and one shot gun! There, safety can now
   be achieved!

   With the opportunity to shoot the problem drivers on the road, commuter
   traffic jams will be a thing of the past! -Kevo

   the President put in charge of all things guns, instructing citizens to

   largenose,

   I doubt anything but the gov't folks would be "responsible" in your
   eyes...

   However, these possibly responsible, possibly not, gun owners are in
   fact, becoming "well regulated" by practicing.. They are shooting at a
   range and campaign signs make excellent targets, they are rigid paper
   (no ricochet, yet stand up straight), and are small enough to make it a
   challenge...

   When you hate guns anyway, it doesn't matter what pains we citizens
   take, you'll never be happy. Case and point, the already stringent
   restrictions on ownership and yet you're calling ever for more....

   Catherine, the point the shotgun is being fired from is either the
   first shotgun point, or the last handgun point. Either way, we had
   permission from the range officer to shoot that particular firearm from
   that shooting point.

   RobDon. What proposals are "illegal? What's wrong with background
   checks? Who needs a military style assault weapon? How are banning them
   illegal? Who needs more than a 10 round clip? (If you can't hit it with
   1, I don't want you around me.)

   No I'm not a gun "hater". I dislike irreasponsible gun owners. I can
   name 8 houses on my block with more than 20 guns. All have children
   under 5 years old. ! keeps their guns locked in a safe. All firearms
   are loaded. 1 out of 8 responsible owners. Not a good ratio.

   larry74,

   VP Biden who is in charge of the President's efforts on gun control
   advised women to buy a shot gun and just shoot it up into the air to
   scare off intruders (which is what he told his wife) and in a [56]Field
   and Stream magazine said,

     (Biden) said, "Well, you know, my shotgun will do better for you
     than your AR-15, because you want to keep someone away from your
     house, just fire the shotgun through the door."

   Shooting up into the air and blindly through a door are both
   irresponsible and in many cases illegal. This is who we should listen
   to on how to protect ourselves with guns?

   And, thanks for asking specifics if you were unsure. Most here don't
   want to hear a different opinion so they choose to "collapse" comments
   with which they disagree.

   Oh for God's sake, for the position of highway superintendent I would
   be much more interested in how competent they are in that job,
   including budgeting, management of a large, complex organization and
   the people and resources within. If the only thing Walsh has is an A
   rating for the NRA, it doesn't say anything for her other
   qualifications.

   talk. Again. What's wrong with requiring every person haveing a
   background check prior to buy a weapon? I've been to gun "shows" tht
   didn't even ask for ID. And you're against closing these "gun show"

   Alva: Bidens point about a shotgun being better than an AR15 for home
   protection is 100% correct. You have no integrity about gun issues, you
   buy into conspiracy theories about recent mass shootings, which is
   tantamount to spitting in the faces of the living friends and relatives
   of the actual victims. It's vile and despicable what you say, and the
   fact that you feel it advances gun interests also puts into question
   your intelligence...

   I'm the one who posted the vid, recorded, and now pulled it.

   For the record, i'm about as far from a "right wing extremest" as you
   can get.
   I believe that people should be free to live their lives as they see
   fit, and until you infringe on someone else's rights you are free to do
   as you see fit. I support gay rights and the legalization of marijuana.

   My reasons for shooting the sign had nothing to do with his ability to
   preform as the highway super, but were in reaction to his pledge to
   vote AGAINST the NY Safe act, and his subsequent vote in favor of the
   bill.

   My vote will reflect his dishonesty, and his failure to keep his word,
   not his stance on firearms. His going back on his word made me loose
   any confidence in him. He would be capable of LESS damage to our
   natural born rights as a highway super than he would as an assemblyman.

   And for those of you claiming its out of line in sight of the recent
   mass shootings, look on my youtube page and at the video titled "The
   recent school shooting. " I'm just as heartbroken by the loss of life
   as any other rational person would be. However, the issue is not with
   firearms, the issue is with how we deal with our mental health system.

   This is also worth a look. You can buy an "80% lower" which is a lower
   receiver that has not yet been completed. It is unregulated, as it is
   not a functioning weapon, but with a very accurate jig (also
   unregulated), and a drill that can penetrate metal (which also isn't a
   gun, and therefor unregulated), you can have a lower receiver that is
   an unregistered, DiY project, and you don't even need a 3D printer. In
   other words, 3D printing is unlikely to have a significant impact on
   the state of unregistered guns, but this might still be a little scary.
   It's mostly a very fringy group of people (and just nerds) doing this,
   and the transfer of DiY guns I'm pretty sure is highly illegal, but I
   mean to communicate that this isn't a new problem.

   Also, the government is not supposed to keep records of who owns what
   gun (except in certain states). Anything collected for a background
   check is supposed to be destroyed within a week or so of the background
   check taking place, so... I guess make of that what you will.

   Using your logic: Because people can break a law, they shouldn't make

   Since people can commit murder, there is no reason to have laws against
   murder. Makes perfect sense. Since people can make bombs, laws against
   making bombs are negated?

   Very absurd. And while that may not be exactly what you said, it is the

   You are aware of the fact they are no longer needed. You do know that

   You do realize they fought for our formation not against it right? You
   are aware that the so called militias of today are terrorist
   organizations that are always getting recruits by claiming they will
   need to overthrow the government someday right?

   Your pacifier is a sick toy of mental midgets , in my opinion. But then
   this is a democracy so until enough people get sick of the killing to

   You are as ignorant as can be, the 2nd Amendment is here to protect the
   right of the people to keep and bear arms. It's purpose is to defend
   ourselves against tyranny. The truth is that the American people ARE
   the militia. Dont believe me? How about we go to a quote from the
   Father of the Bill of Rights, George Mason?

   "I ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people, except for a
   few public officials."
   -- George Mason, in Debates in Virginia Convention on Ratification of
   the Constitution, Elliot, Vol. 3, June 16, 1788

   "You are aware of the fact they are no longer needed. You do know that
   when they were used we had no regular army with its own armory right.
   You do realize they fought for our formation not against it right? You
   are aware that the so called militias of today are terrorist
   organizations that are always getting recruits by claiming they will
   need to overthrow the government someday right?

   Your pacifier is a sick toy of mental midgets , in my opinion. But then
   this is a democracy so until enough people get sick of the killing to
   force a vote on repealing the second amendment then all I can do is
   vote for any politician that is willing to try and outlaw
   automatics,semi-automatics and pistols."

   Listen Paul, as long as tyranny exists, and it always will, the 2nd
   Amendment will ALWAYS be needed. But there is a big difference between
   rights and needs. You don't NEED to be in this country, so if you don't
   respect our rights, I have a simple solution for you, LEAVE! Go over to
   Mexico where there is gun control, and when you see a gang of drug
   cartel thugs with AK-47s that are actually FULL AUTO, go up to them and
   tell them they are not allowed to have those AKs, and that if they dont
   get rid of them you're going to call the cops on them. I'm sure they
   will laugh at you real hard before putting you out of your misery.

   so what if he vote for or against it. He's not running for a position
   that involves gun control. He's running for highway superintendent.
   which, to me he wouldn't want renegade gun on his highways anyway.
   Simple as that.

   Jake: Politicians lie, cheat, steal, and change positions, daily. You
   vote with your guns, much like my brother-in-law, but he at least is
   honest enough to admit it...

   When is it right to steal a candidates campaign sign for your own use?
   I highly doubt the shooters made a campaign contribution for the signs.

   Clearly The hardest left candidate winning in a hard left Chicago
   district is every bit the indicator of national feelings on Guns as
   Steve Stockman winning in his district is.

   "The right of the people to keep and bear arms SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED".
   In NY it says CANNOT be infringed. Mr. Losquadro violated his oath to
   protect that. So yes I am against him, and I applaud [217]Jake Albano
   for using his 1st and 2nd Amendment rights to send Mr. Losquadro a
   message, if you can't be trusted to uphold your oath to the
   constitution, then you CAN'T be trusted with ANY elected position.
   These liberals and RINOs are a cancer on New York State, and we cannot
   allow the cancer to spread. Vote Kathy Walsh!

   Losquadro for highway department superintendent. Using guns to shoot up
   a sign says something about the lack of maturity of this NRA sponsored
   group. There seems to be an element in this NRA group that are "a
   bubble off."

   No brainier here. You shave 5-10% of the Democratic voter base away
   because they oppose new gun control legislation as not all democrats
   are liberals, the dems are toast. Should have heeded Clinton's advice
   on this one. 2014 is going to be unforgiving. You take a small time
   election like this, and only the frothing people come out, this story
   will repeat itself all over the nation. They are literally 100's of
   grassroots Gun Rights Democrat sites popping up with up to the minute
   news about who our legislators are and what they do regarding gun
   control, and when its time to vote, especially in small elections, when
   everyone is sleeping, the frothing people come out, and gun control
   advocates are looking for a new job the next day.

   I doubt however Suffolk is a barometer anymore than Chicago. They are
   one of only 2 or 3 counties who have not either adopted resolutions, or
   proposed resolutions against the NY safe act. I think Suffolk is a safe
   place for a gun control advocate, however step outside NYC, they would
   get burned badly.
