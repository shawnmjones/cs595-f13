   The White House announced that President Obama will make a statement on
   Syria at 1:15 PM ET on Syria. It seems unlikely he'll be announcing the
   beginning of hostilities, according to [31]The Hill:

     President Obama will make a statement on Syria early Saturday
     afternoon as the administration lays the groundwork for military
     strikes in response to alleged use of chemical weapons by Bashar
     Assad's regime.

     The president is not expected to discuss imminent military
     operations in Syria, but to instead update the nation about his
     decisions on how to proceed.

   [32]10:37 AM PT: Waiting. Waiting. For those of you who don't want to
   listen to the pundit chatter on MSNBC, there's also a livestream
   available from the White house [33]here.

   Your Tweets Before Statement
   -- [36]@stefanjbecket
   [37]10:48 AM PT:
   [38][bGlobe_normal.jpg] RT @ap: BREAKING: AP sources say Obama is
   considering seeking congressional authorization for action against
   Syria.
   -- [39]@BostonGlobe

   [40]10:52 AM PT: The president begins, going over the evidence
   Secretary of State John Kerry gave yesterday. Adds that this is a
   national security risk for America and our allies. "This menace must be
   confronted." We must intervene, no boots on the ground. "Limited in
   scope."

   [41]10:54 AM PT: "We are prepared to strike whenever we choose." It
   will be effective any time, not time-sensitive. But we are a government
   of the people. "I will seek an authorization for the use of force" from
   Congress.

   [42]10:56 AM PT: His administration will supply Congressional members
   with all the information they need. He's confident in the case he's
   made, he's comfortable going forward without UN approval. But he still
   will seek Congressional approval even though he believes his office has
   the authority to act.

   [43]10:57 AM PT: What message will we send if dictators can gas
   children without paying a price? he asks." This has implications beyond
   chemical warfare." How can we stand up to other governments if we let
   this pass? "We cannot raise our children in a world where we do not
   follow through on the things we say."

   [44]11:00 AM PT: "I believe the people's representatives must be
   invested in what this country does abroad."

   [45]11:00 AM PT (Laura Clawson): "To all members of Congress in both
   parties, I ask you to take this vote for our national security. I am
   looking forward to the debate." Asks Congress to rise above
   partisanship. "We lead with the belief that right makes might, not the
   other way around."

   [46]11:02 AM PT: Bottom line, now that he's done: He will seek
   Congressional approval for action, but still fully believes there is
   presidential authority to act without it. He is confident Congressional
   leaders will vote for action once all the evidence is presented to
   them.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [61]Tagging tips - [62]Search For Tags - [63]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [64]Civil
   Rights, [65]Community, [66]Congress, [67]Culture, [68]Economy,
   [69]Education, [70]Elections, [71]Energy, [72]Environment, [73]Health
   Care, [74]International, [75]Labor, [76]Law, [77]Media, [78]Meta,
   [79]National Security, [80]Science, [81]Transportation, or [82]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([83]California, [84]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Once the UK said no. So does Obama once no one else wants to do
       anything. So does Obama when he once again realizes how much of a
       dope he looks. So does Obama when he realized he needed an out to
       try to save face. So does Obama when he decided Congress would
       serve as a nice scapegoat if they said no.
       If Obama truly agreed, then what took so long to seek Congressional
       approval? Him and his entire administration have been beating the
       war drums for at least 10 days, and yet not a hint of seeking
       Congressional approval, until all of a sudden everyone he thought
       would be on his side...was not. And now he realizes how dumb he
       looks to Russia and China and the rest of the world. Now all of a
       sudden he wants Congressional approval. He could have sought it on
       Thursday, or Wednesday, or Tuesday, or Monday, or last Sunday, or
       last Saturday...

 Rethugs will oppose a new war? ([352]3+ / 0-)

       Maybe a few of them. The House recently passed the [356]Nuclear
       Iran Prevention Act of 2013 with overwhelming bipartisan support.
       Seventy-six senators [357]signed a letter to the president calling
       on him to reinforce the credibility of the military option against
       Iran in the wake of the Rouhani election.
       We have another AUMF vote in the offing here. Will it even be
       close? When it comes to war in the ME the Congress is most often a
       pushover.

   And an attack actually creates greater danger to oil supplies than not.

     Syria has not exported any oil since late 2011, when international
     sanctions came into force. Prior to the sanctions Syria produced
     370,000 barrels per day (bpd), roughly 0.4 percent of global
     supplies, and exported less than 150,000 bpd, mainly to Europe.

     But there are concerns that a U.S. strike could cause the Lebanese
     militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and has been
     involved in fighting in Syria, to carry out retaliatory attacks in
     Turkey, Jordan, or oil-producing Iraq.

   Killing many innocent people to protect some innocent people in the

   Letting the CIA create this mess - even more problematic.

 great article ([696]0+ / 0-)

     If this is really about justice, is there no place for due process
     and critical scrutiny of the intelligence before letting loose with
     lethal power? And let us not kid ourselves in the face of a
     concerted rhetoric effort by the Obama administration to downgrade
     what is really unfolding. We hear of narrow limited strikes,
     targeted surgical procedures, and it's as if robots will reach into
     Syria, avoid all the people, and defanf the military capabilities of
     the Assad regime.

     War, it ought to go without saying, is a risky, unpredictable
     pursuit. You fire missiles at another country and people will die.
     If we have learned anything from the past decade, it's that military
     campaigns have unintended consequences. We could miss the intended
     targets or learn that the things we were aiming at had other uses
     than those we understood. We could provoke a strike on Israel from
     Iran. We could incite unforeseen violence from the Assad regime. And
     when one of those things happens and some fresh hell breaks loose,
     genuine moral leadership capable of speaking for international norms
     had best be supported by more than a couple of far-flung allies
     going along on a ride that has not been adequately mapped out.

     For Obama, this poorly sold, as-yet ill-defined intervention into
     another seething conflict in the Middle East presents grave risks:
     He could wind up representing the sort of American power defined by
     his predecessor, the shoot first-contemplate later mode of operation
     that has served no interests beyond the Islamist militants for whom
     such violence functions as a valuable recruiting aid.

     It doesn't matter that Bush was (kind of) a cowboy, and that Obama
     was (kind of) a law professor; all of that became irrelevant, or at
     least superfluous, when they became American presidents. To embody
     the sovereign will of the United States--to be the world's only
     superpower, the world policeman--is to be bound by the logic of
     arbitrary power, to be forced to occupy and preserve the state of
     exception in which American exceptionalism is founded. Because the
     United States is powerful, it has the power to decide where and how
     and when and to whom the rules apply. If it does not have that
     power, it is not powerful; if it is not powerful, it is not the
     United States. The stakes for every American president, then, are
     existential. If Syria is allowed to cross the red line unpunished,
     it will threaten the very basis of American identity, the
     exceptionalism which makes America the solitary sovereign actor on
     the world stage. Punishing them for doing so--with a handful of
     inconsequential cruise missiles or even a more aggressive and
     disastrous bombing campaign--would accomplish no more than
     re-instating that narrative, that the United States is, still, the
     decider. But that's all its meant to accomplish.

   Good article; worth reading the whole thing.

   Yet nobody is truly proposing that we do that. And with good reason,
   given the consequences. Assad doesn't seem inclined to step down. The
   rest of the world isn't going to make him. The rebels seem unable to
   force him...

   So failing that, what do we do? Do we know with certainty that Assad
   ordered or authorized the gassing? We don't appear to even know where
   the CW are located, which is just well, since the administration
   doesn't seem inclined to risk civilian exposure by bombing those sites
   anyway.

   If drawing red lines compels you to act without the ability to truly
   alter the course of the conflict, I don't think we should be drawing
   red lines, even as valid as the outrage towards Assad's murder of his
   people is.

       ...I was in extended conversations with people right here who

       As for the cited blockquote, which I wrote, it is no surprise that
       he, like every president before him back 60 years, has been
       unwilling to surrender executive power that has gradually been
       accumulated. The executive branch has for decades argued that the
       War Powers Act of 1973 is unconstitutional. That doesn't make it
       so.
       The point is that he has, imo, taken the right step in this matter
       and decided to delay what was being presented as an imminent
       intervention until Congress has its say. There is nothing bad in
       that decision either for those of us who oppose unilateral military

       He noticed that his high-handedness with Congress was stoking
       opposition to military action, and that, in fact, what the American
       people hated most about striking Syria was that he didn't even
       intend to have Congress debate the issue.
       There are other things the American people hate about striking
       Syria, rather intensely, but that one was at the top of the list.
       Since Obama is probably fairly sure of having leadership from both
       parties on his side, he is probably fairly sure that he will get
       his authorization.   Although, maybe not--because that begs the
       question of why he would have pushed forward without them in the
       first place. Perhaps that part of it was a trial balloon of sorts,
       to see how much objection he would meet if he did start acting
       unilaterally without Congress.

 I'm willing to give him credit, MB ([1228]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   but I'm not willing to act like going to Congress was his plan all
   along.  I'm giving him credit for coming to his senses, not for being a
   great defender of the Constitution and the balance of powers.

   It's an important distinction.

   I've noticed around here that on the few occasions when opposition has
   made Obama step back and change his position, it's often the case that
   Obama is described as agreeing with the opposition, as if he had been
   in agreement all along. Someone did this just today, in fact.  But
   taking a crappy position and then letting yourself be argued out of it,
   while admirable for its willingness to accept criticism and change
   course, is not the same as taking the right position from the
   beginning.

   The party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits

       I have no idea how many tomahawk missiles for how many days, the

   represent the American people's voices. It's pretty clear that Congress
   doesn't. It's not the same as in Great Britain. And if Congress
   approves it, it's because they don't have skin in the game and limbs to
   lose. It's the folks you can just use, abuse, manipulate and break, the
   poor folks.

   It looks as if Obama's move is a democratic one in a democracy that
   still pretends it is one.

   But with democracies like this one, I would in the words of  Rumsfeld

       If he is in favor, but realizes it's a tough sale to the country,
       and his willing to defer to Congress, as the representatives of the
       public, that's a good thing. Whether he will proceed if there is a

 Securing the CW is not a stated objective. ([1578]0+ / 0-)
       The stated objective is to "punish" the regime in Damascus for
       using CW on civilians in a civil conflict.
       The real objective is to end the stalemate and force the government
       forces into a cease-fire and peace talks with the rebels... with or
       without Assad.
       It is highly preferable that the Syrian Army remain in control of
       the CW until peacekeeping troops can be brought in to enforce the
       cease-fire.
       The trick is to hurt the Syrian Army just enough to convince them
       they're not going win this war, but to leave them just strong
       enough to defend themselves and prevent ethnic cleansing of the
       Alawite community.
       The President isn't going to discuss the real objective in public,
       because he needs the "punishment" motive as diplomatic cover to
       keep Russia and Iran at bay.

   1) Yes, Obama ought to seek and receive Congressional authorization.
   It's the way the system is designed to work.

   2) Squalling Congressional Republicans ought to shut their pieholes, as
   they spent the entire Bush administration yowling about how the
   president has the "inherent authority" as CiC to do any damn thing he
   pleased, and it was Congress's job to wave its collective hands and
   say, "It's all you, George! We don't want to tie your hands or
   anything! Hugs and sloppy kisses!"

   3) Using the same argument that half of Congress and every member of
   the Bush administration who didn't sort mail for a living, Obama has
   the authorization from the 2001 AUMF to turn Syria into a patch of
   glowing black glass if he chooses. He shouldn't do either of those
   things, but if he adopted the GOP's own arguments, he certainly could.

       WJC was ready to start the action back in June and was publicly
       criticizing Obama for being too slow about it.

     Bill Clinton told Sen. John McCain he agrees that President Barack
     Obama should act more forcefully to support anti-Assad rebels in
     Syria, saying the American public elects presidents and members of
     Congress "to see down the road" and "to win."

     At another point during a closed-press event Tuesday, Clinton
     implied that Obama or any president risks looking like "a total
     fool" if they listen too closely to opinion polls and act too
     cautiously. He used his own decisions on Kosovo and Bosnia as a
     point of reference.

       In fact, he suggested Obama would be a "wuss" for listening to

     "You just think how lame you'd be... suppose I had let a million
     people, two million people be refugees out of Kosovo, a couple
     hundred thousand people die, and they say, `You could have stopped
     this by dropping a few bombs. Why didn't you do it?' And I say,
     `because the House of Representatives voted 75% against it?'"

       He seems very pre-committed to an invasion, for whatever reason.
       The buildup for this "crisis" has been going on for the last 3 or 4
       years, there are obviously some very wealthy and powerful people
       who want this to happen, who want access to the pipelines and
       energy resources.  There's a lot of private profit to be had in
       following through on the original plan.
       Obama's not up for re-election and doesn't care much about a
       legacy, except that he wants to be seen as a macho kind of POTUS.

       Tell us all about those hugely valuable and desirable pipelines and
       energy resources in Syria. How acquisition of them will far
       outweigh increased instability in the surrounding region and their
       piddly little pipelines and miniscule energy resources.
       Or maybe try responding to the facts of the situation.
       Here it is again - since you apparently missed it the first time

     Syria has not exported any oil since late 2011, when international
     sanctions came into force. Prior to the sanctions Syria produced
     370,000 barrels per day (bpd), roughly 0.4 percent of global
     supplies, and exported less than 150,000 bpd, mainly to Europe.

     But there are concerns that a U.S. strike could cause the Lebanese
     militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and has been
     involved in fighting in Syria, to carry out retaliatory attacks in
     Turkey, Jordan, or oil-producing Iraq.

   I'm glad he's deigning to request approval from Congress, but it looks

   I honestly believe it would be better to allow the UN process to

   Assad? Probably. But make them do so in writing so that if we DO take
   action we can honestly say we did so because the UN failed.

   As it is Obama pointed out that by waiting for Congressional approval
   the UN will have more time to analyze the information it has. Another
   commenter said the UN inspectors have left due the threat of a US
   attack. This is bad. We should make sure they do their job thoroughly

   legally he has the arguments on his side in saying the illegality of

   make me not do it. It's in your hands and not in mine" and at the same
   time saying "I am not the guy who doesn't face the soup, but you might
   be"?

   Well, so now what? Congress should debate? I can't for the life of me
   see that this Congress debates in earnest anything.

   All I see is people being pissed off at everyone and everything around
   them.

   But I don't understand the whole shebang. Someone enlighten me, please.

   Whatever he does I think it's like the situation of a parent being
   principled and trying to hold a bad behaving kid accountable and punish
   it with methods the parents know won't help.

   Welcome to reality.

 Regarding the President's statement today: ([2346]7+ / 0-)

   Maybe some of the hysteria over Syria will die down a little bit now,
   on both the right and the left. Some additional thoughts:

   -So much for those salivating Tea Baggers' wet dream of hoping the
   president would take rash, unilateral military action so they could
   force their Republican puppets to put articles of impeachment on the
   table for allegedly violating his Constitutional authority.
   (Nyeah-nuyeah-nyeah-nyeah-neayh. Dream on if you think this president
   is going to give you the satisfaction...you can continue to go about
   trying to manufacture another bogus reason for impeachment.)

   -To my ears, these comments by the President regarding Syria were pitch
   perfect.

   -For those claiming that President Obama was just like President Bush
   when it comes to wanting to go to war, it appears you may have been
   premature in making that judgment. President Obama may still take
   military action, but this shows me that he doesn't exactly relish the
   idea, unlike President Bush, who virtually salivated for the
   opportunity to be a "war president" so he use that term for political
   purposes, including re-election. President Obama's approach to this is
   completely different from President Bush's "my way or the highway"
   approach.

   For Obama, increases stress on the internal GOP rift (Rand Paul clearly
   will be a lead opponent vs McCain/Graham, who knows where Cruz ends up)

   For Repubs, either they help block it (damage Obama's standing) or
   provide enough votes to go forward, hope Obama gets blame if/when
   doesn't succeed

   This is a horrible choice - if no one acts, easier for chemical weapons
   to be accepted, which is terrible; if we act, we're making ourselves
   the world's conscience, a role tough for us to play, and of course the
   way this could go wrong are numerous.

   Not sure how I'd vote. I'm glad he's going to Congress though.

   are insecticide for humans. A single drop of exposure leads to burning,
   twitching, convulsions and then death. Totally horrific. Anyone who
   uses such weapons, especially on children, deserves the full fury of
   the civilized nations of the world. If Russia wants to count itself
   among the civilized nations, it needs to get out of the way and stop
   supporting Assad. President Obama has done the right thing here. Assad
   isn't going anywhere. We can wait a few weeks while Congress gets its
   say, time we can use to turn the screws on the gutless Saudis,
   reluctant Turks and over-cautious NATO. Further action will be
   necessary to ensure that such weapons do not fall into the hands of Al
   Qaeda, who are clearly present in Syria and are actively exploiting the
   chaos. Their possession of such materials would pose an existential
   threat to Americans everywhere. The Syrian chemical weapons need to be
   destroyed as soon as possible and Assad and his regime brought before
   the Criminal Court of Justice.

   The GOP will be against it, since their one and only principle is
   opposing Obama.

   And Democrats who wouldn't want to be mean to anyone even if they
   dirty-bombed capitol will oppose it also.

   I could be wrong of course.  Wouldn't be the first time.

   And if the vote loses, Obama will go ahead anyway and lots of the
   Kossack community can yell 'worse than Bush.'
