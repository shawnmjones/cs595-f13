[23]Government reports just 88,000 jobs added in March, with 7.6% jobless
rate. U6 falls to 13.8%

   March was the 30th consecutive month the government has reported that
   the seasonally adjusted job gains outpaced losses. But, at 88,000, the
   number [30]announced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was far below
   the February figure and is clearly going in the wrong direction. The
   January and February numbers, however, were revised upward.

   A consensus of experts surveyed ahead of time by Bloomberg News had
   forecast the BLS would report 193,000 new jobs had been added in March.
   Even the most pessimistic advance appraisal, however, didn't come close
   to the actual number. The official unemployment rate fell to 7.6%, but
   that was wholly a function of a reduced workforce.

   The private sector expanded by 95,000 jobs. Governments at all levels
   lost a total of 7,000 jobs, but 14,000 were lost in federal employment,
   so local and state governments have been doing some hiring. Last March,
   the BLS reported a seasonally adjusted gain of 205,000 private- and
   public-sector jobs.

   One good bit of news was that the BLS revised its previously reported
   growth in payroll employment for January from 119,000 to 148,000 and
   for February from 236,000 to 268,000. The BLS counted 11.7 million
   Americans as unemployed. Those unemployed for six months or more fell
   to 4.6 million. The civilian labor force participation ratio fell to
   63.3 percent, its lowest level October 1978; the employment-population
   ratio fell to 58.5 percent. That is is within the range it has been in
   for the past four years but it had previously not been so low since
   1983. Some 496,000 Americans left the labor force in March.

   In BLS jargon, the added 88,000 jobs constitute "U3." But the bureau
   also measures with an alternative gauge called "U6." This tallies
   workers who are part-time not by choice but for "economic reason,"
   meaning they want full-time jobs but can't find them, and some but not
   all Americans who want jobs but have stopping looking for one. The U6
   rate for March dropped to 13.8 percent. Add up the 11.7 million who are
   officially unemployed (U3), the 7.6  million underemployed (U6), and
   the 6.72 million who are not in the labor force but say they want a
   job, and you have 26 million unemployed and underemployed Americans.

   At the current pace, the increase in jobs means just getting back to
   where the nation was when the recession began 65 months ago will take
   until 2018 or later, more than a decade all told. But in the post-World
   War II era, the shortest time between one recession and the next was
   just under nine years. Critics have pointed out that, in one of the
   more insidious forms of class warfare, productivity gains have been
   accruing almost exclusively to employers not workers. Median household
   income now is eight percent less than it was in 2000. And corporate
   profits have doubled. In short, even those Americans lucky enough to
   have jobs are not, on average, faring as well as they were before the
   Great Recession struck.

   The federal budget sequester began March 1, and since the BLS closes
   the data for its report on the 12th of each month, it's a little early
   for the impact from that to be hitting very hard. But the Congressional
   Budget Office estimates that if it continues to the end of the fiscal
   year, it could cost 750,000 jobs. But some economists scoff at this,
   saying the CBO's methodology is off and, at worst, the sequester might
   force the shedding of 300,000 jobs. Split the difference, and the
   economy could lose two to three months worth of job growth between now
   and September 30.

   For more details about today's jobs report, please continue reading
   below the fold.

   As I have previously explained:

     The government's BLS jobs report is the product of a pair of
     surveys, one of more than 410,000 business establishments called
     Current Employment Statistics, and one called the Current Population
     Survey, which questions 60,000 householders. The establishment
     survey determines how many new jobs were added, always calculated on
     a seasonally adjusted basis. The CPS provides data that determine
     the official "headline" unemployment rate, also known as "U3."
     That's the number which is now 7.7 percent.

     The BLS report only provides a snapshot of what's happening at a
     single point in time. The jobs-created-last-month-numbers that it
     reports are not "real." Not because of a conspiracy, but because BLS
     statisticians apply seasonal adjustments to the raw data, estimate
     the number of jobs created by the "birth" and "death" of businesses,
     use other filters. In the fine print, they tell us that the actual
     number of newly created jobs reported is actually plus or minus
     100,000.

   Because of this range of possibilities, the economy could have lost as
   many as 12,000 jobs in March or could have added as many as 188,000. As
   better data are obtained, the BLS revises its count each month for the
   previous two months. Today's numbers will be fine-tuned in the May and
   June reports just as January's and February's were revised
   substantially upward by today's.

   Every month, one or two days ahead of the BLS report, Automatic Data
   Processing, one of the nation's largest payroll services companies,
   also provides a snapshot of newly added seasonally adjusted jobs
   created solely by the private sector. On Wednesday ADP [31]reported
   that the economy generated 158,000 new private-sector jobs in March.

   Also on Wednesday, TrimTabs Investment Research [32]estimated that
   156,000 new jobs had been added to the economy in March. The firm
   calculates payroll job growth based on daily deposits of income taxes
   being withheld from people's paychecks.

   o o o

   Here's what the job growth numbers looked like in March for the
   previous 10 years. These data have been recalculated via the BLS's
   annual benchmark revisions:

   March 2003: -  215,000
   March 2004: + 333,000
   March 2005: + 135,000
   March 2006: + 280,000
   March 2007: + 186,000
   March 2008: -    79,000
   March 2009: -  830,000
   March 2010: -  154,000
   March 2011: + 205,000
   March 2012: + 205,000
   March 2013: +   88,000

   Among other changes in today's job report:

   o Professional services: + 51,000
   o Leisure & hospitality: + 13,000
   o Health care: + 23,000
   o Retail trade: - 24,000
   o Construction: + 18,000
   o The average workweek (for production and non-supervisory workers)
   rose 0.1 hour to 34.6 hours.
   o Average manufacturing hours fell 0.1 to 40.8 hours.
   o The average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm
   payrolls rose 1 cent from February's revised figure to $23.82.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       There's more than enough evidence showing that companies are
       abusing the system and not even trying to recruit US workers then
       turning around and saying there's not enough skilled workers.
       They simply want a higher, cheaper supply of labor to screw
       workers.

       I've been in offices where tech jobs are suddenly "outsourced" to
       Indian companies that promise cheap labor with work visas. These
       employees don't get paid the same as regular workers. I've talked
       with a few and they end up all living together in cramped
       apartments just to survive.
       This is not encouraging when "work visas" equate to "imported slave
       labor".

   how many points will the UE rate jump?

   There are millions of potential workers here on visa overstays that
   will not be competing for entry-level jobs.  They will be competing for
   much higher paying jobs in the tech, health and administrative fields.

   I have given up hope that my field, IT, will turn around anytime soon.
    More and more projects are being outsourced to India and Pakistan and
   elsewhere, or the government allows those workers to simply come here
   and earn slave wages for slave hours.  And, all the workers who never
   bothered to go home will soon be given the red carpet treatment and
   allowed, with the blessings of the US government, to step into what few
   IT jobs are left.

 IT industry failures... ([167]6+ / 0-)

       I know what you mean. It's not that we are bitter IT workers
       towards them. But the companies that scam these people into the
       country are creating a real crisis. We expect each worker to be
       paid a commensurate wage. When companies fail to do so they create
       a vacuum. And when they ignore or prohibit hiring of the existing
       US IT workforce just to get cheap labor they end up breaking the
       overall industry.
       In the past workers had to strike to get fair wages for all.
       Nowadays, Congress is circumventing Labor through these Work Visa
       programs. They were not meant to be used as a cudgel against Labor.
       They were meant to find necessary skills when we didn't have enough
       in the country already.
       IT workers are currently underemployed or unemployed simply because
       the companies are either too cheap or too self-important to hire
       and train up the current work force. They are looking for extremely
       experienced and skilled IT workers at below rockbottom salaries.
       This isn't the way America works.
       There are a few tenets to IT hiring I tend to stick to.
       - Hire for skills, but look for talent: Hire skilled workers and
       trainable workers. You can hire a person with the right skills but
       you can't make them work. It takes skills plus talent to make a
       team work.
       - Pay people what they are worth and they work harder: Skimping on
       salaries just for budgetary reasons is a losing proposition. As a
       manager, you have the job of securing the funding necessary to make
       the project succeed. It's your failure if you can't. Underpaying
       workers depresses their talents and can even make them make
       mistakes that can cost you success overall. It's not worth it.
       - Train a workforce, don't just hire one: It's an old idea which
       has been discarded over the years thanks to outsourcing. But it
       needs to come back if we are going to make real jobs in this
       country. Hiring a worker is like planting a seed. You grow them
       into what you need them to be in the future as part of the overall
       team. You can build a tremendous team of individuals if you can
       follow all of these tenets correctly. People that can be
       dependable, dedicated and enthusiastic about your company's
       success.
       But of course, companies fail in this arena. They hire peicemeal
       for projects. The do so on the cheap and personnel move on to other
       places multiple times because of this. The IT world suffers because
       of it.

       Especially point three, training.  This is a point that's often
       overlooked whenever people talk about the phantom "skills-gap" our
       nation faces.  Now, somewhat obviously, there isn't any kind of
       skills gap, because if there were, unemployment would be near rock
       bottom in sectors of the economy, and wages would be sky-rocketing
       as companies fought over the highly-demanded but limited supply of
       skilled workers.
       But second, and more importantly, if there were a skills gap, how
       come companies aren't hiring people and training them?  Are they
       such terrible employers they're afraid people will flee to greener
       fields as soon as the training is complete?
       The example I always call to mind is World War II.  America sent
       its men off to war.  But America also needed industry to produce
       the goods to win the war!  So what did American companies do?  They
       shattered the gender barrier, and hired completely unskilled women,
       who after being trained were assembling the planes, bombs, tanks,
       and ships we needed to win the war.  That's what a skills shortage
       looks like.
       American companies today have a terrible disease of the mind.  They
       don't want to please customers, just shareholders.  They don't want
       to pay their employees, just their executives.  And they don't want
       to train the next generation, they just want to import foreigners
       who have state-subsidized educations, who will work in America at
       rock bottom wages.  It's terrible.

 I agree and would add a couple things ([199]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [200]Wynter, [201]denise b

   One is sort of an offshoot of your final point: when making any
   decision that might impact them, take them into account and if possible
   include them. This applies to numerous things, including not creating
   an environment so hectic they can't be effective (the studies on this
   should terrify managers concerned about productivity)

   The other builds on your first point - it is difficult to find workers
   who meet all the criteria for a professional IT position. Over the past
   few years, my small team at a large company has had occasion to need a
   number of people. Out of loads and loads of resumes, few were what we
   needed (and our needs are not unusual). Out of the few we interviewed,
   few would have worked out. Out of the few we actually hired. . .let's
   just say the trend continued, though there were a couple bright spots.

      The point of all this is that in IT at least, both employers and
   workers have focused too much on technical ability and not enough on
   other things that make for a good employee and a good team. The result
   is a workforce increasingly devoid of these skills. I tend to think
   that some older workers might be more likely to fit the bill if only
   companies were willing to invest the time on training. But the overall
   problem is a lack of focus on what matters most.

   The IT world isn't the only world that suffers because of this. The
   idea of a bright line between IT and the rest of the company is a
   concept that needs to go away in this day and age. For most of the
   nation's top companies, IT should be inextricably intertwined with the
   business.

 Recruiting suffers of test aces. ([205]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [206]eparrot

       IT has suffered a good deal from having too many skill sets that
       are in technology that is moving faster and faster. I can't tell
       you how many jobs I have seen that posted that want obscure skill
       sets or combinations of skillsets all at the expert level even
       though that version of the skill only came out a year or so ago.
       I'm one of those old school mainframe folks that grew into the .Net
       web area of developing. And there is no way in hell I can keep up
       with all the various branches to this segment of the field. Most of
       these specific skillsets are similar and if you can understand one
       you can figure out the other in with a little bit of training or on
       the job experience. But many recruiters don't look for that when
       they screen resumes. They look only for the keywords and don't
       delve deeper to see whether the candidate could actually compensate
       for this on the job.
       I pride myself as a jack of all trades that can adapt to almost any
       environment or requirement given a chance. But you can't shine in
       an interview these days with just that behind you. They fire off
       questions not designed to gauge your ability to solve problems but
       rather to ascertain if you know the keywords, jargon or obscure
       factoids that accompany a skillset. Only asking test type questions
       will always get you someone that can pass tests, not someone that
       can properly develop, code, and test an application. We have lost
       the ability in recruiting to adequately assess candidates.

       every bit as much as government spending money.  Keynes even
       identified lowering taxes as a way to stimulate.
       While I agree with you that under funding SS was not a smart thing,
       the payroll tax holiday was a perfectly targeted stimulus.  It
       affected lower and middle income earners much more than higher
       earners - and those lower income earners were much more likely to
       inject those dollars immediately back into the economy through
       consumer spending.

   the revisions to January and February were both very positive (+29k and

   (seems to be the pattern for the past 2 years of weak initial reports
   and strong revisions).

   Also, U-6 declining is again a sign that this isn't all about
   "discouraged workers" but may be a more fundamental shift that we
   should have expected with an aging population.

   Overall, the initial read is not good, but let's see how the revisions

       You are seeing more kids staying in school/not entering the

       You are likely seeing more single income families (something made
       possible by extremely low interest rates and technology).  In other

       that declaration turned to ashes.
       That is not to say nothing good has happened since the recession
       officially ended nearly four years ago. Obviously, the growth we've
       had is better than what was happening right about now in 2009 with
       jobs being shed in the 600,000s each month. But the old saw about
       employment being a "lagging indicator" that improves several months
       to a year behind GDP recovery leaves a sour taste given how long

   Something like $20 billion is coming out of the economy on a monthly
   basis due to the loss of relief in FICA taxes. The sequester results in
   an additional $14 billion that must be cut from the Fed budget over the
   next 6 months. Added together that's a $34 billion monthly hit to the
   economy split between retail sales (mostly discretionary I hope) and
   government purchases of goods and services from the private sector.

   There will be direct government jobs lost due to the sequester but
   there's no way you can cover any significant fraction of the costs by
   dumping employees. You have to close entire operating facilities and
   eliminate all associated costs.

   We've been experiencing an inventory build in the economy coming out of
   the 4th qtr and that led to a lot of early year hiring, same as has
   occurred in the last 3 years or so, but that's mostly over for now. The
   danger right now is if we start losing jobs going forward. That would
   be a major blow to confidence with potential contagion effects.

   The President stated that we could lose as many as 750k jobs due to the
   sequester. The Fed chairman said the sequester would cut 1.5 percentage
   points from GDP. I think we should consider these forecasts to be more
   accurate than what is coming out of wall street given that wall
   street's incentive for accuracy is dubious.

   That said, we don't want to make too much out of any one month, given
   the way that the numbers are derived, but I fear that our leaders have
   decided to "solve" this problem by defining it away.

   The overall job number chart is a good start just to see if we are

   number is a smokescreen for a more nasty problem we are seeing... low
   paying or underpaying jobs.

   We should be able to generate a job breakdown from the new jobs
   detailing out what types of jobs are being created. Are they "flipping
   burgers" or are they "engineering/tech" jobs?

   These trends will tell us if this is a good recovery overall or it's a
   false recovery that is just good for the 1%.

 What recovery? ([563]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [564]MPociask, [565]HeyMikey, [566]Tweedledee5

   Look at where we should be in employment not just percent job loss, but
   relative to population growth. The civilian participation rate is a
   better measure. I just don't think that we have a real recovery.

   MB's observation that a recession will happen before we return to the
   employment level pre-crash is correct. But the goal is to attain the
   the level that we would have been at without the crash. This seems
   impossible. Given that each successive recession has taken longer and
   longer to recover we may have significant structural problems with the
   economy.

   The stock market, some local real estate markets and corporate earnings
   are up. Personal earnings are flat. I ask manufacturers and retailers
   in my business sector and the response is always the same "what
   recovery?" Granted, this is anecdotal evidence, but if we had a robust
   recovery it would have encompassed all of my sources.

   The unemployment rate becomes more and more suspect as the recession
   continues as more workers give up and potential new workers don't even
   try. The economist's definition of recession is dysfunctional. If we
   lost 80% of the economy and then in the next quarter grew 1% of what
   was left we would be out of a recession. When employment is back to
   where it should be as a function of population then I'd say that the
   recession is over.

       Since, as you mentioned, it's pegged to quarter to quarter growth.
        Those are very fuzzy numbers - estimating GDP is an art, not a
       science.  And if GDP is growing, not a recession!  Never mind if
       all the gains are going to the top 10%, while the bottom 90% are
       worse off.
       Recession and growth are just arbitrary terms - we could redefine
       them by any metric we wanted, really.  What would a people driven
       definition look like?  Perhaps several factors - has job growth
       been outpacing population growth - have median wages been rising -
       how close is the economy to outputting at maximum capacity - what
       are poverty or food stamp numbers doing?
       It'd be a messier test than just saying GDP up, GDP down, but then
       again, reality is messy.

       The unspoken assumption here is that employment "where we would

       of population" = employment where we actually were before the
       crash.
       That assumption, unfortunately, is incorrect.
       We are dealing with both:
       (a) a hit to employment that should be short-term, but is being
       prolonged due to government austerity bungling (Dems) and malice
       (GOP);
       AND
       (b) long-term, essentially permanent, changes due to automation and
       offshoring, which mean the US economy may never again provide jobs

       Amazon is also buying up warehouse space in medium-sized cities.
       Looks like it will soon have next-day delivery standard, with

       Google's self-driving vehicles are, of course, already well-known.
       What this means is that soon most retail shopping will be done via

       Most retail jobs will disappear.

 Automation ([593]0+ / 0-)
       Just means that certain jobs that were once done by people are now
       done by machines.  This is something economies have been facing
       since, what, the water wheel?  And more importantly, the Industrial
       Revolution?
       The Industrial Revolution was a plus for jobs - it freed up people
       from menial tasks and allowed them to put their talents to use at
       more productive positions.
       I guess if there's a point of divergence on how people view
       automation, it's this.  You can believe either A) almost everyone
       has talents that can be put to use in an economy, and given the
       chance people will put those talents to work, or B) there's a
       significant amount of people who will have no talents to contribute
       in a highly automated society, and they will essentially be
       obsolete and unemployable.
       Put me in camp A.  Bring on the Burrito Bombers!  I think
       automation is just the fruition of John Adam's statement:

     I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study
     mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and

 "In the long run, we're all dead"--Keynes. ([597]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [598]The Wizard

       You're absolutely right--but only in the long run, which (absent
       WWII-scale government intervention) will likely be decades.
       Read the Stiglitz piece. It shows how leaps in farm efficiency
       created the Great Depression, by making millions of former farm
       workers "surplus." And they remained "surplus" until we went on the
       humongous Keynesian stimulus program known as World War II. And it
       shows how the same kind of thing has been going on for the last few
       decades in manufacturing, and (as I showed above) retail is next.

 Need more Sequester news... ([603]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [604]Meteor Blades, [605]pollwatcher, [606]Tweedledee5

   The media needs to step up to the plate and start highlighting all the
   bad news that is coming out of the Sequester and labeling it for
   exactly what it is.

   If we let them get away with it they will just start labeling any old
   downward trend as part of the slow recovery. The media needs to take
   responsibility for things and start investigating for a change.

   We are losing ground because the Sequester still exists.

   REPEAL the damn thing and we can move on to recovering jobs like we
   should have been doing years ago!

   For doing these posts every month.  It's real yeoman's work you do, and
   obviously a lot of time goes into it.  Whenever I hear job news
   somewhere other than here first, I wait to read what you're going to
   write about it.

   A statistic you sometimes highlight is the amount of jobs needed to
   keep up with population growth - I think it's something like 100,000.
   In my book, that means this month we lost jobs.  (Never mind using a
   sensible metric, like number of jobs needed per month to return to
   previous peak employment in, say, a year.  If we counted jobs that way,
   people would realize what a catastrophe the job market is.  But I guess
   it's hard to combat the scary sounding-ness of TRILLION DOLLAR
   DEFICIT).

 I find this data to be complete and utter B.S. ([613]0+ / 0-)

   86,000 jobs added?  Are you frickin kidding me?  Someone's been
   botching with the data in my view or maybe the data has been reported
   to be insufficient.

   Either way, I'm not believing a single bit of it because I know the Bay
   Area (where I live) shouldn't be the least bit affected by this.  We're
   adding jobs all around, companies are hiring (even Oracle is hiring
   sales people like mad) and it's been off the hook since last fall.
   Start-up comings are growing like crazy and it won't stop.

   Now for other areas n the U.S.?  Well, that's to be determined.  I
   can't speak for them.

   But assuming this data is in fact accurate.  Well, we know we need to
   work to defeat all GOP in Congress for re-election one by one!

 Sorry 88,000 jobs added ([616]0+ / 0-)

   Still, I've realized that the Bay Area's growth is only one small
   portion of the economy.

 While the sequester formally did not hit until ([619]0+ / 0-)

   March 1, that it was coming has been known in earnest since the
   beginning of the year, and that may have sapped employers of
   confidence, particularly defense contractors.

 Leadership of both Parties stabbing America in ([622]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [623]Tweedledee5

   the back.

   1) Like many others here, I spent my own money and months of my time
   working during the Bush Administrations to overthrow the Republicans
   and install Democrats.    In 2009 we had a Democrat in the White House,
   a huge Democratic supermajority in the House and a filibuster proof
   Democratic majority in the Senate.

   And what was the result?

   2) The Superrich got bailed out,  $7 Trillion in debt was dumped onto
   the common citizen and we've endured almost 5 years of massive
   unemployment.

   A major cause of our recession is that income and wealth have become
   deeply concentrated in people who have put the money under mattresses
   in the Cayman Islands -- instead of investing it to provide jobs.   The
   fix is to confiscate that income and wealth via taxes and give it to
   the lower 98% percent who will spend it and get the economy going.
   Instead, we  extended the Bush Tax Cuts for the Rich.

   3) I despise Republican prostitutes.   But I also despise Democrats who
   think our current situation is acceptable -- who argue that the
   Democratic leadership is only screwing us 93% whereas the Evil
   Republicans would screw us 95%  and so we should give unquestioning
   obedience and support to the current leadership instead of trying to
   reform the Party.

   4) If Obama was like FDR he would have put the Republicans in the
   wilderness for 40 years for what they did when they were in power --
   instead,  he was totally silent for a year while the Tea Party
   Astroturf spread their lying propaganda and the Republicans were back
   in control of the White House 2 years later.

   5) SilverOz argument above that labor force participation is due to
   baby boomers going into golden retirement is utter crap -- most boomers
   no longer have the savings to retire.   As at least one commentator has
   noted today,  this longlived recession ensures that many baby boomers
   are going to be in deep poverty 10 years hence --even if Medicare and
   Social Security are not cut.

   6) But , hey, Bill Clinton has $40 million net worth last time I
   checked.   Maybe he and Citigroup's Sandy Weill can explain how that
   financial deregulation they passed with  Republican Senator Phil Gramm
   back in 1999 will bring on a golden age of prosperity shortly.

   7) There is one thing worse than an enemy that attacks you from the
   front --it is an enemy that takes command of your outrage and anger
   just so that they can lead you off a cliff and leave you impotent,
   impoverished, embittered and deeply depressed.

   88,000 jobs added is better then 87,000 jobs, if we can Net 88,000 jobs
   per month unemployment will be under 1% by the time Hillary takes
   office in 2017.
   Which also means I too will soon find a job and not have to take my MBA
   for retraining in burger flipping.
   Lets keep this train rolling.
