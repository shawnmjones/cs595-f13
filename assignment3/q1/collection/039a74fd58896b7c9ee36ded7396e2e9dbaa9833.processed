[24]GOP can back immigration reform and suffer short term, or suffer forever

   reform at Chamizal National Memorial Park in El Paso, Texas, May 10,
   2011. REUTERS/Jim Young
   National Review [30]plays dumb.

     John McCain, a principal instigator of the Senate group, has made
     his motives clear: "Elections, elections -- the Republican party is
     losing the support of Hispanic citizens." His plan apparently is to
     develop a bipartisan approach to helping Republicans win elections;
     perhaps Chuck Schumer imagines other outcomes. Senator McCain has
     not said why he believes that the interests of Hispanic citizens are
     to be identified with those of non-citizens, why those interests
     should trump the interests of citizens (including Hispanic citizens)
     harmed by the lawlessness of our borders, or why a senator with an
     established record for supporting amnesty could not muster one in
     three votes from those Hispanic citizens.

   George W. Bush, the most Latino-friendly Republican in forever, got 40
   percent of the Latino vote (I know some claim it was lower, but I'm not
   convinced). McCain got 31 percent, Mitt Romney 27 percent. Why did
   McCain only get 31 percent? Because he spent the entire GOP primary
   season promising to [31]vote against the same immigration reform
   policies he had previously championed.

   But let's look at this another way: electorally.

   President Barack Obama won last year 51-47. Had Mitt Romney equaled
   Bush's 40 percent with Latinos, the totals would've been 50-49 (around
   49.8-48.8 to be exact). Had Romney gotten ~44 percent of the Latino
   vote, he would've won the popular vote.

   The Latino community is growing. It went from 9 percent of voters in
   2008 to 10 percent in 2012. The median age of natural-born Latinos is
   18. The percent of the non-white vote is expected to rise another two
   points in 2016 (and Asians and African Americans are even more
   Democratic than Latinos).

   Republicans will never win a majority of the Latino vote. There are
   simply too many core disagreements on both economic on social issues.
   But 40 percent isn't out of the realm of possibilities. And once you
   get to 40 percent with brown Americans, you don't need to squeeze out
   as many more (diminishing) Anglo voters. It's still a tough task for
   any Republican, but not as rough as losing 75-80 percent of the
   non-Anglo vote makes it.

   The percent of the non-Anglo voters is expected to rise another two
   points in 2016, from 28 to 30 percent. Think of it this way: If Anglos
   were 70 percent of voters last year instead of 72, it would've boosted
   Obama's winning margin by 1.4 points, from:
   Obama 51.1, Romney 47.2

   to:
   Obama 51.8, Romney 46.6

   If that seems crazy, it is! And this is the dilemma the McCains of the
   GOP are trying to address. Yes, they won't win the Latino vote,
   probably ever. But they have no prayer of winning the White House
   unless they begin to chip away at Democratic advantages with non-white
   constituencies. And they'll never stand a chance of doing that unless
   they stop standing in the way of reform.

   I know it's an impossible choice for them--most of those legalized
   immigrants would end up Democratic voters. But conservatives have a
   choice between a short term problem and a never-ending one.

   Because the growth of Americas brown population isn't slowing. So
   Republicans can either take their bitter medicine (immigration reform)
   and suffer short term, or stand in the way of it, and suffer short term
   ... and long term.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   minorities don't have a fair shot at these jobs because the whites want
   them that badly and make it hard to get hired or into some unions.

   Fact is there aren't jobs Americans don't want to do, but there are
   wages they won't take for them. Around here you can earn a living at
   hard manual labor.

   grow. If they are legalized they will pay into the social security
   system, that helps us all.  I think the worst thing about a high
   percentage of undocumented people is that employers don't have a need
   to improve working conditions. They can hire someone who can't
   complain.

   I also think that having a large group of people with less rights or no
   rights causes numerous social problems for everyone. Crime victims and
   witnesses won't talk to the police because they are afraid of the
   consequences.

   I know a lot of people think it is a crime for people to come here
   without proper documentation, but we have to be realistic. Some people
   came as kids and had no say in the matter, some people had no way of
   surviving the 8-15 year wait to get in.

       we need them because they will pay their fair taxes? not unless
       there is tax reform because otherwise they will get screwed as the
       rest of us do. Their coming here does not nothing to make things

       hope they can all buy real estate but there are many of Americans
       locked out of owning real estate due to prices in some places but
       also tough mortgage requirements and tight funding.
       think there are always people that drive w/o a license for many
       reasons so again, them coming here legally does not automatically
       mean they run out and get licenses.
       do you even know what it would mean to them??? does it matter to

       people, but in others it has been revved up. It seems to me that
       from 2008-2010, there was just a horrible anti-immigrant sentiment
       flooding the airwaves, comments sections, etc.
       There are some people who just believe what they here or see. If
       all they see of immigrants are people being arrested for drug
       crimes or any other negative stereotype then they will think about
       that group as "bad". If other things were emphasized, like family
       values, the work-ethic, respect for authority and the elderly, then
       people would think differently. Well, some people anyway.

 Lindsay Graham said a while back... ([295]0+ / 0-)

   ...that "we're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in

   Graham knows that his party, the GOP, is dependent on the "Angry White
   Male" segment of the population, which is slowly decreasing as
   percentage of the national electorate, as its political base.

   Over the next several decades, the GOP will have to pull itself to the
   center in order to remain relevant on the national political stage, as
   ultra-conservatives will probably only be able to get elected in some
   pockets of the Deep South (such as Graham's home state of South
   Carolina) and Interior West a few decades from now.

   Blacks, homosexuals, Hispanics, workers, immigrants, people of
   religions that are not theirs, etc. have been so successful among their
   racist base that Republicans cannot put the genie back in the bottle.
   Their base demands racism/xenophobia/hatred and since the base is all
   they have they will always play that card in the elections.

   They somehow thought that Cuban-Americans did not pay any attention to
   their campaign of hatred against all Hispanics (since local ads were
   always sure to attack Castro and pretend to be for Cuban-Americans),
   but Republicans forget that the inter-tubz carries their
   campaigns-o-hatred to everyone, even HIspanics like Cuban-Americans
   that had  overwhelmingly supported Republicans since Bay of Pigs.

   The GOP base hates the idea of giving the 'illegals' amnesty in any
   circumstances.  So, let's say they swallow their pill now and offer a
   path to citizenship in hopes that someday, they may begin to attract
   minorities again.  That will piss off their base, who in turn will
   primary any GOP congressmember who votes for the bill and then elect
   folks who are even more rabidly anti-brown.  Which drives away
   minorities even more. And leads to more electoral losses because even
   reasonable white folks are repelled by the racism.  I think they are
   fucked.  They have kept the Southern Strategy and it its latest
   manifestation is the Teabaggers.  They have no way of putting that

   ...that the growing Latino demographic means that Republicans ought to

   voters.  Worrying about adding more Latino voters with amnesty is in

       Republicans have worked themselves into this predicament precisely
       because they have always chosen the short-term solution over the
       long-term.  They're predatory opportunists, which shows as well in
       their economic ideology.  This type of mentality always goes for
       the short cut, easy fix, and they wind up in a tar pit as a result.

   Most of the even somewhat moderate GOP politicians in congress are out

   constituencies.  These people have very little to gain and much to lose
   (tea party primary) by supporting what will be called amnesty.  The
   good news is that a filibuster might not happen as there are SOME
   moderate Rs in the Senate, but you might have to wait until 2014 to get
   it through congress.

   I doubt it will hurt them that much in the long run though as this

   long they think they're going to be relevant, never mind a force to be
   reckoned with.

   They're aging out. McCain, McTurtle and Cryin' John are not going to be
   around forever.  Especially if they get primaried for not being far
   enough to the right.  Even the younger ones have crossed from fringe to
   f&ckin' nuts, so they won't be viable much longer.

   The younger generation of Americans do not see their world in the same
   terms that the current Teabagging Republicans do.  If television and
   radio changed my generation, the internet and social media have done
   the same for the last two generations. And that is a good thing!

   Every now and then, immigration becomes an issue in this country.  My
   ancestors (the filthy, drunken, lazy, stupid Irish) got the 'No Welcome
   Mat' thrown at their feet.  They took the jobs no one else wanted to
   do.  All the same crap that is going on now, went on for my
   ancestors...and the ancestors of everyone on DK.  Some had it even
   worse, as they didn't even ask to come here in the first damn place!

   With a little help, with a lot of determination, and with the
   challenging of the silly-assed stereotypes, each successive group of
   immigrants has found their place here.  And so it shall be again.

   And we are all the better for it.

   If the Republicans cannot understand that, they have no place in the
   future of this country, and we should wave them a hearty, "See ya!!" as
   the screen door hits them in the ass on the way out.

 Votes are irrelevant. ([644]0+ / 0-)

   Both party leaderships are corporate whores (engaging in
   war-profiteering, torture, bankster bailouts, deregulated trade etc,)
   and are very adept at making pro-corporate policy appear beneficial to
   the average Joe. We'd better support policy based on our own economic
   best-interests.
   The Democratic base has never had a solid understanding of basic
   macroeconomics, the Law of Supply and Demand being the leading example.
   While the so-called 'protectionists' continue to clearly explain (over
   the last forty f*cking years or so) about what happens when the supply
   of labor increases while consumer disposable income/demand remains
   relatively unchanged, it produces a lower demand for labor and downward
   pressure on wages (as has already happened through `free' unrestricted
   trade). This stellar counsel continues to be ignored as an overwhelming
   majority of Democrats now support loosening immigration laws (which
   will also produce a supply of labor increase).
   The so-called 'protectionists' will continue to be proven right on
   these issues (i.e. the Law of Supply and Demand is called a "Law"
   because it is, wait for it, A F*CKING PHYSICAL/PHISICAL LAW, i.e. it's
   like gravity, there are NO F*CKING EXCEPTIONS TO THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND
   DEMAND.
   Those who are well-off enough to profit from this supply of labor
   increase, mostly republicans (yes we must not forget that George W.
   Bush tried, and Ronald Reagan actually succeeded in INCREASING THE
   SUPPLY OF LABOR by legalizing millions of immigrants, which officially
   makes this yet another TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN POLICY) will profit from
   the cheap labor while those who are not well-off enough to profit from
   the supply of labor increase will see their real wages fall (i.e. the
   Law of Supply and Demand). Consumers may get lower prices on some
   products/services, but it will be the 'save money live better'
   mindfuck, downward pressure on wages will continue to outrun whatever
   savings they getting, because ALL OF THE CORPORATE SAVINGS (from the
   cheap labor) DO NOT GET PASSED DOWN TO THE CONSUMER.
   Whether one understands the economics or not, the idea that getting
   more democratic votes as automatically being the ticket for higher
   living-standards for the working-class (while ignoring time-tested LAWS
   of economics) is a belief for the politically blind. We'd better
   support policy based on our own economic best-interests.

   FDR/Truman, and everything got turned on its head.

   As much as we are enjoying the problems of the Republicans, they could
