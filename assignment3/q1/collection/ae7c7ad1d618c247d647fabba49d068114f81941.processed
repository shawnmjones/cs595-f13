[3]My Occupy LA Arrest, by Patrick Meighan (UPDATE: 12/9/11)

   My name is Patrick Meighan, and I'm a husband, a father, a writer on
   the Fox animated sitcom "Family Guy", and a member of the Unitarian
   Universalist Community Church of Santa Monica.

   I was arrested at about 1 a.m. Wednesday morning with 291 other people
   at Occupy LA. I was sitting in City Hall Park with a pillow, a blanket,
   and a copy of Thich Nhat Hanh's "Being Peace" when 1,400 heavily-armed
   LAPD officers in paramilitary SWAT gear streamed in. I was in a group
   of about 50 peaceful protestors who sat Indian-style, arms interlocked,
   around a tent (the symbolic image of the Occupy movement). The LAPD
   officers encircled us, weapons drawn, while we chanted "We Are
   Peaceful" and "We Are Nonviolent" and "Join Us."

   As we sat there, encircled, a separate team of LAPD officers used
   knives to slice open every personal tent in the park. They forcibly
   removed anyone sleeping inside, and then yanked out and destroyed any
   personal property inside those tents, scattering the contents across
   the park. They then did the same with the communal property of the
   Occupy LA movement. For example, I watched as the LAPD destroyed a
   pop-up canopy tent that, until that moment, had been serving as Occupy
   LA's First Aid and Wellness tent, in which volunteer health
   professionals gave free medical care to absolutely anyone who requested
   it. As it happens, my family had personally contributed that exact
   canopy tent to Occupy LA, at a cost of several hundred of my family's
   dollars. As I watched, the LAPD sliced that canopy tent to shreds,
   broke the telescoping poles into pieces and scattered the detritus
   across the park. Note that these were the objects described in
   subsequent mainstream press reports as "30 tons of garbage" that was
   "abandoned" by Occupy LA: personal property forcibly stolen from us,
   destroyed in front of our eyes and then left for maintenance workers to
   dispose of while we were sent to prison.

   When the LAPD finally began arresting those of us interlocked around
   the symbolic tent, we were all ordered by the LAPD to unlink from each
   other (in order to facilitate the arrests). Each seated, nonviolent
   protester beside me who refused to cooperate by unlinking his arms had
   the following done to him: an LAPD officer would forcibly extend the
   protestor's legs, grab his left foot, twist it all the way around and
   then stomp his boot on the insole, pinning the protestor's left foot to
   the pavement, twisted backwards. Then the LAPD officer would grab the
   protestor's right foot and twist it all the way the other direction
   until the non-violent protestor, in incredible agony, would shriek in
   pain and unlink from his neighbor.

   It was horrible to watch, and apparently designed to terrorize the rest
   of us. At least I was sufficiently terrorized. I unlinked my arms
   voluntarily and informed the LAPD officers that I would go peacefully
   and cooperatively. I stood as instructed, and then I had my arms
   wrenched behind my back, and an officer hyperextended my wrists into my
   inner arms. It was super violent, it hurt really really bad, and he was
   doing it on purpose. When I involuntarily recoiled from the pain, the
   LAPD officer threw me face-first to the pavement. He had my hands
   behind my back, so I landed right on my face. The officer dropped with
   his knee on my back and ground my face into the pavement. It really,
   really hurt and my face started bleeding and I was very scared. I
   begged for mercy and I promised that I was honestly not resisting and
   would not resist.

   My hands were then zipcuffed very tightly behind my back, where they
   turned blue. I am now suffering nerve damage in my right thumb and
   palm.

   I was put on a paddywagon with other nonviolent protestors and taken to
   a parking garage in Parker Center. They forced us to kneel (and
   sit--SEE UPDATE) on the hard pavement of that parking garage for seven
   straight hours with our hands still tightly zipcuffed behind our backs.
   Some began to pass out. One man rolled to the ground and vomited for a
   long, long time before falling unconscious. The LAPD officers watched
   and did nothing.

   At 9 a.m. we were finally taken from the pavement into the station to
   be processed. The charge was sitting in the park after the police said
   not to. It's a misdemeanor. Almost always, for a misdemeanor, the
   police just give you a ticket and let you go. It costs you a couple
   hundred dollars. Apparently, that's what happened with most every other
   misdemeanor arrest in LA that day.

   With us Occupy LA protestors, however, they set bail at $5,000 and
   booked us into jail. Almost none of the protesters could afford to bail
   themselves out. I'm lucky and I could afford it, except the LAPD spent
   all day refusing to actually *accept* the bail they set. If you were an
   accused murderer or a rapist in LAPD custody that day, you could bail
   yourself right out and be back on the street, no problem. But if you
   were a nonviolent Occupy LA protestor with bail money in hand, you were
   held long into the following morning, with absolutely no access to a
   lawyer.

   I spent most of my day and night crammed into an eight-man jail cell,
   along with sixteen other Occupy LA protesters. My sleeping spot was on
   the floor next to the toilet.

   Finally, at 2:30 the next morning, after twenty-five hours in custody,
   I was released on bail. But there were at least 200 Occupy LA
   protestors who couldn't afford the bail. The LAPD chose to keep those
   peaceful, non-violent protesters in prison for two full days... the
   absolute legal maximum that the LAPD is allowed to detain someone on
   misdemeanor charges.

   As a reminder, Antonio Villaraigosa has referred to all of this as "the
   LAPD's finest hour."

   So that's what happened to the 292 women and men were arrested last
   Wednesday. Now let's talk about a man who was not arrested last
   Wednesday. He is former Citigroup CEO Charles Prince. Under Charles
   Prince, Citigroup was guilty of massive, coordinated securities fraud.

   Citigroup spent years intentionally buying up every bad mortgage loan
   it could find, creating bad securities out of those bad loans and then
   selling shares in those bad securities to duped investors. And then
   they sometimes secretly bet *against* their *own* bad securities to
   make even more money. For one such bad Citigroup security, Citigroup
   executives were internally calling it, quote, "a collection of
   dogshit". To investors, however, they called it, quote, "an attractive
   investment rigorously selected by an independent investment adviser".

   This is fraud, and it's a felony, and the Charles Princes of the world
   spent several years doing it again and again: knowingly writing bad
   mortgages, and then packaging them into fraudulent securities which
   they then sold to suckers and then repeating the process. This is a big
   part of why your property values went up so fast. But then the bubble
   burst, and that's why our economy is now shattered for a generation,
   and it's also why your home is now underwater. Or at least mine is.

   Anyway, if your retirement fund lost a decade's-worth of gains
   overnight, this is why.

   If your son's middle school has added furlough days because the school
   district can't afford to keep its doors open for a full school year,
   this is why.

   If your daughter has come out of college with a degree only to discover
   that there are no jobs for her, this is why.

   But back to Charles Prince. For his four years of in charge of massive,
   repeated fraud at Citigroup, he received fifty-three million dollars in
   salary and also received another ninety-four million dollars in stock
   holdings. What Charles Prince has *not* received is a pair of zipcuffs.
   The nerves in his thumb are fine. No cop has thrown Charles Prince into
   the pavement, face-first. Each and every peaceful, nonviolent Occupy LA
   protester arrested last week has has spent more time sleeping on a jail
   floor than every single Charles Prince on Wall Street, combined.

   The more I think about that, the madder I get. What does it say about
   our country that nonviolent protesters are given the bottom of a police
   boot while those who steal hundreds of billions, do trillions worth of
   damage to our economy and shatter our social fabric for a generation
   are not only spared the zipcuffs but showered with rewards?

   In any event, believe it or not, I'm really not angry that I got
   arrested. I chose to get arrested. And I'm not even angry that the
   mayor and the LAPD decided to give non-violent protestors like me a
   little extra shiv in jail (although I'm not especially grateful for it
   either).

   I'm just really angry that every single Charles Prince wasn't in jail
   with me.

   Thank you for letting me share that anger with you today.

   Patrick Meighan

   -------

   UPDATE (12/9/11): Hey all, thank you for the nice thoughts from many
   folks who have read this account. One necessary clarification about the
   7 hours spent by the roughly 100-of-us in the Parker Center parking
   garage immediately following our arrest:

   though we were indeed forced to kneel on that parking garage pavement
   for an extended period and though we did in fact have our hands tightly
   zipcuffed behind our backs for that entire seven-hour stretch on the
   pavement, and though we were barred from standing and moving for that
   time period, the LAPD officers, in point of fact, did allow us to shift
   ourselves out of the kneeling position onto our butt-cheeks, our
   side-legs, etc., as necessary. At the very least, when we began to do
   so, they did not stop us. I apologize for implying otherwise.
   I also want to say that I don't consider my above-described treatment
   at the hands of the LAPD to be, in any way, uniquely-brutal, or that I
   was especially victimized. Yes, getting arrested and going to jail was
   scary and sometimes painful and it generally sucked, but jail is
   supposed to suck. Again, the point of this blogpost is not that I was
   treated especially poorly by the LAPD officers who arrested, processed
   and held us. The LAPD officers were just doing their jobs, as they
   understood them. The point of the blogpost is simply to contrast the
   legal response to nonviolent protestors against the the legal response
   (or, rather, non-response) to the perpetrators of the largest act of
   coordinated larceny in economic history, for whom the next arrest will
   be the first one.

   Best,
