[24]John Boehner can thank God for his job. Literally.

   House Speaker John Boehner makes a brief statement to the media at the
   Capitol in Washington December 19, 2012. Frustrated by their inability
   to wring more
   "I didn't need mom or apple pie, I had God."
   In the [30]latest rehash of the ongoing war among House Republicans
   that pits the completely crazy against the marginally less insane wing
   of the party, we learn one interesting thing: In January, when John
   Boehner's reelection as Speaker of the House was in doubt, it took
   divine providence to save him. No, really.

     Barely 36 hours after the caustic New Year's Day vote, Boehner faced
     a coup attempt from a clutch of renegade conservatives. The cabal
     quickly fell apart when several Republicans, after a night of
     prayer, said God told them to spare the speaker.

   Huh. Considering what a failure Boehner's leadership has been, this
   seems to prove that God does indeed work in mysterious ways.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       It seems like an expression of vanity, doesn't it, to believe that
       God is running around like a sort of valet or butler attending to
       your every whim and answering to your every anxiety?
       I happen to belong to a Christian sect, but I have to confess that
       this idea of God having this sort of personal interest in the daily
       drag of my life and an obligation to answer to me all the time ...
       It's a bit foreign.

       to tell people what they, themselves, already want to do.
       Therefore, in this instance, it won't be good.
       I actually haven't seen any instance where God "spoke" to someone
       that had a good outcome in general, actually.
       A quick review also shows that God always has exactly the same
       prejudices that the person being "spoken" to does.  He's really
       very accommodating that way.

   Just like when George Bush said that "God told me to invade Iraq," it
   was Dick Cheney on the White House intercom.

   Remember this Onion article? [305]http://www.theonion.com/...

   Voice Of God Revealed To Be Cheney On Intercom

   WASHINGTON, DC--Telephone logs recorded by the National Security Agency
   and obtained by Congress as part of an ongoing investigation suggest
   that the vice president may have used the Oval Office intercom system
   to address President Bush at crucial moments, giving categorical
   directives in a voice the president believed to be that of God.

   President Bush sits at his desk in the Oval Office, where he received
   messages from an intercom voice identifying itself as "God" and thought
   to have been Vice President Cheney (below).
   While journalists and presidential historians had long noted Bush's
   deep faith and Cheney's powerful influence in the White House, few had
   drawn a direct correlation between the two until Tuesday, when
   transcripts of meetings that took place in March and April of 2002
   became available.

   In a transcript of an intercom exchange recorded in March 2002, a voice
   positively identified as the vice president's identifies himself as
   "the Lord thy God" and promotes the invasion of Iraq, as well as the
   use of torture in prisoner interrogations.

   A close examination of Bush's public statements and Secret Service time
   logs tracking the vice president reveals a consistent pattern, one
   which links Bush's belief that he had received word from God with
   Cheney's use of the White House's telephone-based intercom system.

   Officials privately acknowledged that there is reason to believe that
   the vice president, as God, urged Bush to sign legislation benefiting
   oil companies in 2005.

   "There's a lot of religious zeal in the West Wing," said a former White
   House staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It's possible
   that the vice president has taken advantage of that to fast-track
   certain administration objectives."

   An ex-Treasury Department official and longtime friend of Cheney was
   asked to comment on the vice president's possible subterfuge. "I don't
   know. I certainly don't think it's something [Cheney] planned," he
   said. "I do know that Mr. Bush was unfamiliar with a phone-based
   intercom, and I suppose it is possible that Dick took advantage of
   that."

   A highly placed NSA official who has reviewed the information released
   Tuesday said Cheney masked his clipped monotone, employing a deeper,
   booming voice.

   Vice President Cheney.
   Said the NSA source: "It sounded as though the speaker, who identified
   himself as God, stood away from the intercom to create an echo effect."

   On Capitol Hill, sources are expressing surprise that Cheney, a vice
   president with more influence than any other in U.S. history, would
   have resorted to such deception.

   "The vice president has a lot of sway in this administration," said a
   former White House aide. "But perhaps when President Bush was
   particularly resolute and resistant to mortal persuasion, the vice
   president chose to quickly resolve disputes in his favor with a
   half-decent God impression."

   For many, the revelation explains Bush's confusion in the wake of
   Hurricane Katrina.

   "I was very surprised by the president's slow response in New Orleans,"
   political commentator Bill Kristol said. "The president told me that he
   was praying every day in his office, but had received no reply. I had
   no idea what he meant, but of course, it all makes sense now."

   At the time of Katrina, Cheney was on a fly-fishing trip, from which he
   returned on Sept. 1.

   According to highly placed White House sources, Bush's senior advisers
   are trying to shield the president from the news. Aides are concerned
   that too harsh an awakening might shake Bush's faith, which has been a
   central part of his life for nearly 20 years.

   "It's hard to tell the leader of the free world that he has been the
   butt of an elaborate and long-term ruse," a former staffer said. "Maybe
   it would be easier to take if it came from Cheney's God voice."

     God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game
     of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective
     of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in
     an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with
     blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you

   wants to give up a good bohner when you have one?)  They use the god
   excuse for some very simple reasons:
   1 - Their base is very religious, so the base will go along with it.
   2 - Since God told them to do it, their base won't blame them if it all
   goes to hell. The base will blame Bohener for failing to do gods work.
   Why they kept him is the more interesting question.

   The GOP caucus likely includes among its evangelical Christians some

   Oh, it's you. Do you know what time it is in Beverly Hills?

   Sorry, I didn't know you were there.

   I come here a lot. The parking is good.

   Some of us Tea Party folks were just having a prayer service and we
   wondered if we could ask for your Divine guidance.

   Sigh.

   Specifically should we keep Mr. Boehner as our leader or not.

   Boner? The man's name is really Boner? And he's your leader.
   (God laughs.)

   Yes, but perhaps not for long.

   Mrs. Bachmann. When you came unto my celestial throne many months ago
   asked me if you should run for president I told you no, never, under no
   circumstances and if you even tried I would send drought to the
   heartland of America. And what did you do?

   I ran for president.

   Yes, you disobeyed me and I made your nation dry up. And now you ask me
   if your caucus should replace this Boner person. And with whom would
   you replace him?

   Me.

   Get this right this time, Michelle Bachmann. If you even have one vote
   about this I will triple the plagues I sent to Egypt this time and make
   sure your congressional district gets it worst of all.

   So that's a no?

   While we're at it I want you to leave your job and become a more
   obedient wife to your kind husband. I don't ordinary require wives to
   stay at home and take care of their husbands, but you should restrict
   your public appearances to buying environmentally safe lightbulbs at
   Home Depot to spare the country of your stupidity. Got it?
