Sanford completes political comeback in South Carolina race

   Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) -- Mark Sanford is living proof that
   life is full of second chances.

   The former Republican governor of South Carolina, whose political
   career was left for dead along the Appalachian Trail after an
   extramarital affair, asked for, and Tuesday received, political
   redemption as he won a special election to fill a vacant House seat
   that he once occupied.

   "I want to acknowledge a God not just of second chances but third,
   fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth chances, because that is the
   reality of our shared humanity," Sanford said at his victory
   celebration after defeating his Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Colbert
   Busch. "I am one imperfect man saved by God's grace."

   And at a news conference minutes later, Sanford added that "I think
   we're always on the search for redemption and I think this is certainly
   a degree of political redemption."

   [42]Sanford, who won 54% to 45%, according to an unofficial vote count
   in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, made reference to his
   political baggage from his infamous affair.

   online exchanges with women. Weiner announced in May that he was
   running for mayor of New York City, saying in a video announcing his
   campaign, "I hope I get a second chance to work for you." Weiner's
   comeback bid suffered a potential setback Tuesday, July 23, when he
   acknowledged more sexually tinged exchanges with an unnamed woman.

   for what I did," Spitzer said. "I spent five years of working, doing
   useful things, and I hope the public will offer me an opportunity."

   Mark Sanford wins comeback race
   Mark Sanford wins a second chance
   Sanford burned on affair in debate
   Mark Sanford 'debates' Pelosi poster

   "If it was just about market-based ideas and limited government, this
   campaign would have easily won a long time ago. But I had deficiencies
   that are well chronicled as a candidate and at the end of the day I was
   carried across the threshold, if you will, by an incredible team of
   volunteers."

   Colbert Busch, an official with Clemson University's wind turbine drive
   testing facility who was best known nationally as the sister of
   satirist and Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert, said that, "The
   people have spoken and I respect their decision."

   But she added that "We gave it a heck of fight" and assured supporters
   that "I will continue to fight for the people of South Carolina."

   Sanford won all five counties in the district, including Charleston and
   Beaufort, home to Hilton Head, where some Democrats hoped that older
   voters would be turned off by Sanford's scandals and just stay home. In
   Charleston County, Sanford's home base but the Democrats' best hope as
   well, he narrowly edged out Colbert Busch.

   Colbert Busch won absentee ballots, but it wasn't nearly enough to
   carry her to victory.

   [43]Sanford: Primary win was 'a big referendum' on comeback effort

   "Turnout was very large for a special election -- roughly a quarter of
   the 18-plus population voted, more than 140,000 votes total," said CNN
   Polling Director Keating Holland, who analyzed the vote. "That seems to
   have helped Sanford. Low turnout would have meant a lot of Republicans
   who were reluctant to vote for him and wouldn't vote for a Democrat.
   High turnout turns that around: Plenty of Republicans who had
   misgivings about Sanford came out to vote anyway."

   Sanford's oldest son Marshall and his now-fiancÃ©e Maria Belen Chapur
   were standing beside the candidate at his victory celebration.

   "She flew a continent to be here last night. Whether I won or lost, she
   wanted to be here," Sanford said Wednesday mornign on CNN's "Starting
   Point." "We certainly appreciate her willing to do so, and I think as
   folks get to know her, I think they're going to love her."

   Sanford was in his second term as governor in 2009 when he disappeared
   from public view for several days. At the time his staff claimed he'd
   been hiking the Appalachian Trail. He later admitted that he was
   actually in Argentina, seeing Chapur, with whom he was having an
   affair.

   The episode sank any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the 2012 GOP
   presidential nomination. Sanford and wife Jenny were divorced in 2010.
   He finished his second term as governor in January 2011, after being
   censured and fined tens of thousands of dollars for ethics violations,
   exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity.

   But he came back, beating out 15 other candidates earlier this year to
   win the Republican nomination in the race for the vacant House seat.
   From the start, Sanford was very open about the affair on the campaign
   trail and made it the subject of his first TV ad.

   And even with all his political baggage, he was considered the favorite
   in the race until last month, when court documents revealed his ex-wife
   had filed complaints against Sanford for trespassing on her property.

   Sanford told CNN that he didn't want to leave his sons home alone while
   their mother was away. He's scheduled for a court appearance two days
   after the election.

   Not long after the trespassing story broke, the National Republican
   Congressional Committee announced it was pulling out of the race and
   national Democratic groups announced they were throwing more money into
   the contest.

   And National Democratic groups jumped in. The Democratic Congressional
   Campaign Committee and independent pro-Democrat House Majority PAC
   combined dished out nearly $1 million to defeat Sanford.

   The two groups, as well as Colbert Busch, highlighted the affair. At
   their only general election debate, Colbert Busch brought up Sanford's
   2009 secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress.

   "When we talk about fiscal spending and we talk about protecting the
   taxpayers, it doesn't mean you take that money we saved and leave the
   country for a personal purpose," she said sternly, looking directly at
   her opponent on stage.

   [44]In South Carolina politics, two very different campaign styles

   And her campaign went up with a TV commercial which slammed Sanford for
   using "tax dollars to visit his mistress in Argentina, disappeared for
   a week leaving no one in charge, betrayed all who trusted him, then
   lied to cover it up. Mark Sanford, it's a question of character."

   The DCCC and House Majority PAC have also spotlighted the affair in
   their final ads.

   "I used to be for Mark Sanford, but not any more. He skipped town to be
   with his mistress on Father's Day. Sanford even asked his wife for
   permission to have the affair," said Mt. Pleasant Republican voter
   Jennifer Stark in the House Majority PAC commercial.

   But over the past month, another woman also entered the campaign
   spotlight: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

   Sanford and his campaign repeatedly tried to tie Colbert Busch to
   Pelosi, saying that a vote for Colbert Busch would also be a vote for
   Pelosi, who has high negatives with Republican voters and who most
   likely would become House speaker again if the Democrats run the table
   and regain control of the chamber in next year's midterm elections.

   [45]Opinion: Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace

   "I've fought hard over the years to make South Carolina a better place
   to call home. But those efforts pale now against the larger battle for
   the direction of our country. Maybe that's why Nancy Pelosi and allies
   have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me. But this contest
   is bigger than them or me, it's about two different visions of how we
   restore America and reign in Washington spending," Sanford said,
   looking into the camera in a TV spot that started running district-wide
   last week.

   Two weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of Pelosi to call out
   Colbert Busch for not accepting more than one debate.

   Sanford also repeatedly brought up the money that national Democratic
   groups have poured into the South Carolina race.

   "What it says is, whose voice do you carry when you go to Washington
   D.C.?" he said in the debate with Colbert Busch, pointing to the
   hundreds of thousands of dollars that national Democratic groups have
   spent on the race.

   Colbert Busch, responding to the Sanford criticism, sought to distance
   herself from Washington and from national Democrats.

   "No one tells me what to do except the people of South Carolina's 1st
   Congressional District. So a victory for Elizabeth Colbert Busch is a
   victory for the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District,"
   she told CNN Monday, adding that two-thirds of her contributions have
   come from within the Palmetto State.

   While Sanford touted his fiscal conservative record, Colbert Bush
   campaigned as an independent centrist who would buck President Barack
   Obama. In her CNN interview, she highlighted where she doesn't see eye
   to eye with the president.

   "I respectfully disagree with his budget," she said, adding that "we
   need to vote to repair" the president's health care law.

   Even though they didn't support Sanford, the NRCC congratulated him
   Tuesday night, and said the results could prove troublesome for House
   Democrats in 2014.

   "Democrats spent more than $1 million trying to elect a candidate who
   was backed by the Democrat machine, but at the end of the day, running
   on the Obama-Pelosi ticket was just too toxic for Elizabeth Colbert
   Busch," Rep. Greg Walden, NRCC chairman, said in a statement.

   But national Democrats see a silver lining in Colbert Busch's defeat.

   "House Republicans' outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as
   the face. Republicans now have to defend him and stand with him until
   Election Day," Rep. Steve Israel, DCCC chairman, said in a statement.
   "In this deep red Republican district that Mitt Romney won by 18
   points, the fact that the Democrat made this competitive is a testament
   to the strength of Elizabeth Colbert Busch as a candidate and the
   Republican habit of nominating flawed candidates."

   [46]Sanford has a woman problem

   The congressional seat became vacant when Rep. Tim Scott, who won
   re-election by 27 percentage points last November, was picked by GOP
   Gov. Nikki Haley to fill the Senate seat of Sen. Jim DeMint, who
   stepped down late last year to take over as the head of the
   conservative Heritage Foundation.

   No Democrat has held the seat in more than 30 years, and that streak
   still stands.
