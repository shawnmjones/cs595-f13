    Every week Daily Kos diarists write dozens of environmentally related
   posts. Many don't get the readership they deserve. Helping improve the
   odds is the motivation behind the Green Diary Rescue. In the past seven
      years, there have been 240 of these spotlighting more than 13,608
    eco-diaries. Below are categorized links and excerpts to 57 more that
    appeared in the past seven days. That makes for lots of good reading
    during the spare moments of your weekend. [Disclaimer: Inclusion of a
   diary in the rescue does not necessarily indicate my agreement with or
                             endorsement of it.]

   Green Diary of the Week

   [29]The United Progressive Movement Against ALEC--by Phil Radford II
   Greenpeace: "Corporate money is currently flooding our political system
   and drowning out the voices of everyday Americans. We are gathering
   together in Washington to send the signal that this is still our
   fight-and we have the momentum to win it now.  People from across the
   country are fighting to tip the balance of power back to the people,
   and away from big money and bigotry. We want to realize Martin Luther
   King Jr.'s dream of America, but we can't do it if we're divided into
   separate groups."

   [31]700 Tortoises to be Slaughtered. Because. Austerity--by jpmassar:
   "The race is not always to the swift... Federal funds are running out
   at the Desert Tortoise Conservation Center, and officials plan to close
   the site and euthanize hundreds of the tortoises they've been caring
   for since the animals were added to the endangered species list in
   1990.
   Nor the battle to the strong...The Bureau of Land Management has paid
   for the holding and research facility with fees imposed on developers
   who disturb tortoise habitat on public land. As the housing boom swept
   through southern Nevada in the 2000s, the tortoise budget swelled. But
   when the recession hit, the housing market contracted, and the bureau
   and its local government partners began struggling to meet the center's
   $1 million annual budget. I can be outraged over people being thrown
   out of their homes because of bankers follies. I can seethe than none
   of the banksters are in jail for their frauds. Here, though, I feel no
   fury within. This is just something unspeakably sad."

   [32]Florida citrus grower gets slap on the wrist after killing millions
   of honeybees--by Jen Hayden: "A large, well-known Florida citrus grower
   has been hit with a $1,500 for intentionally killing millions of bees:
   One of Florida's largest citrus growers has been fined after a state
   investigation found it illegally sprayed pesticide that caused the
   death of millions of honeybees. For the last seven years, the nation's
   beekeepers have been plagued by a malady known as colony collapse
   disorder, in which bees disappear from their hives. Pesticides have
   been blamed as one of the causes. The $1,500 state fine last week is
   believed to be the first time a Florida citrus grower was cited in
   connection with a bee kill. It might be the first time a fine has been
   levied, but the $1,500 is angering local beekeepers and
   environmentalists."

   Climate Chaos

   [33]Journal Science reports rising Ocean Acidification reducing cloud
   cover speeding climate change--by Lefty Coaster: "This is dire news.
   The journal science reports that rising Ocean Acidification as more CO2
   is absorbed by the oceans is creating a feedback loop by reducing
   Phytoplankton, causing less dimethylsulphide (DMS) to be released.  DMS
   in the atmosphere in important in cloud formation, fewer fewer clouds
   reflecting less sunlight back to space, resulting in accelerating
   warming.  [...] Back in the 1980s researcher James Lovelock
   hypothesized that that rising CO2 would increase DMS emissions putting
   a brake on accelerated warming. But now researchers have discovered the
   opposite it true with increased CO2 is lowering DMS emissions instead
   as the oceans grow increasingly acidic as they absorb more CO2."

   [34]Could see 10F warming by 2100 due to rapid ocean warming and
   acidification--by VL Baker: "Fasten your seatbeats, it seems that the
   new United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   climate report which I wrote about here is even scarier when you look
   at the climate chaos that they did not include in report.  The nature
   of these large studies done by the IPCC is that they are obsolete the
   moment they are published. Climate change is moving so fast that
   impacts are tipping over each over and are edging closer to runaway
   status. What was not considered into that report was the speeding up of
   Ocean warming and acidification. Much of the planet warming has been
   settling into the depths of the oceans; risking a marine biological
   meltdown 'by end of century.'"

   [35]Fox News ignores elephant in the room: Wonders what's happening to
   Florida's beaches--by VL Baker: "Max Greenberg at Media Matters catches
   Fox News in another 'duh' moment. Thank you to Media Matters for
   watching so that I don't have to spend time pulling out my hair in
   response to the idiocy. Fox News doesn't believe in climate change so
   it's hard for them to say 'the word.' So they just look around at the
   eroding Florida beaches like the fools they are and scratch their
   heads, asking, 'What could be happening to Florida beaches?' Fox News
   reported on the 'very unusual problem' of diminishing sand at Florida
   beaches, terming it an 'environmental ... crisis of the future.'
   However, the network did not mention that phenomenon's connection to
   sea level rise, a major consequence of climate change."

   [36]Cattle--not climate change--killing the Great Barrier Reef--VL
   Baker: "The Great Barrier Reef is considered one of the great wonders
   of the world and was granted World Heritage status in 1981. It's the
   largest coral reef system composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and
   900 islands stretching for over 2,600 kilometres (1,600 mi) over an
   area of approximately 344,400 square kilometres (133,000 sq mi). The
   reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland,
   Australia. The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is
   the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms. [...]
   But all is not well at one of The Seven Natural Wonders of the World."

   [37]Pacific Islanders call for climate change action--by Horace
   Boothroyd III: "On the front page right now are four images of
   shrinking ice sheets. Ice is made of water and that water has to go
   somewhere. Since water like all liquids takes the shape of it's
   container it is entering the ocean. Well, with islands like the
   Marshall's averaging only two meters above sea level all that melted
   ice water, not only from our Poles but the water once consolidated in
   glaciers at mountain peaks above a certain elevation depending on
   latitudes, is encroaching on the fragile island ecosystems and
   displacing both human and other life forms to the ocean. This is
   becoming a great concern to those on the islands in the wide open
   Pacific as they are looking at losing their homes and becoming climate
   refugees."

   [38]Yahoo! doesn't want you to even THINK about climate change--by
   Mike732: "Yahoo! that bastion of freedom, the Fox News of the Internet,
   that glorifier of consumption and the Democracy of the Dollar, hopes
   that you never learn the truth. Probably not about anything, I imagine,
   but most assuredly not about climate change. As they say, you can learn
   a lot of things surfing the Net, much of it wrong and most of it
   useless, but that's your fault. Usually. But say you want to find out
   the latest on 350.org, the major United States champion of at least
   going through the motions of trying to save the planet. Well, you had
   better 'google it.' Only actual yahoos (guilty) 'Yahoo! it,'
   apparently."

   [39]Open thread for night owls: East Antarctica Ice Sheet is melting,
   too--by Meteor Blades: "A study published in Nature has some more bad
   news about global warming. This time it's Antarctica. Andrea Germanos
   reports at Common Dreams: [T]he world's largest ice sheet, previously
   thought to be at little risk from climate change, has undergone rapid
   changes in the past five decades, signaling a potential threat to
   global sea levels. The East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) holds enough
   water to raise sea levels over 50 meters."

   Food, Agriculture & Gardening
   [40]Macca's Meatless Monday: Only you can make this change--by VL
   Baker: "It's the time of year in Florida when you're likely to see
   zucchini, yellow squash and green beans growing everywhere. They grow
   so easily here that any plot of soil is considered prime space for a
   summer squash garden. It's even a southern tradition to find a box of
   the squashes outside your front door with no note attached. So we are
   always seeking new ways to prepare the little beauties and today I will
   share some of my favorites."

   [41]Federal Cuts to Food Assistance to Increase Hunger in PA as Farmers
   Markets Access Expands--by ProgressivePatriotPA: "I discuss a new
   report that shows a cut in federal assistance scheduled to take effect
   this November will reduce the already scarce amount of food available
   to nearly 2 million Pennsylvanians who benefit from the program, and
   offer a little of my own commentary about what this means especially
   since a program that just launched this year is starting to make fresh
   fruits and vegetables from farmers markets available to Pennsylvanians
   who participate in the program."

   [42]Saturday Morning Garden Blogging Vol. 9.28--by Frankenoid: "We've
   had a weird August here in Denver -- hot at the beginning, hot at the
   end, and a week in the middle where it didn't even get to 90°. We've
   had high humidity, sprinkles of rain, but few of the thundershowers
   have fallen in my neighborhood. The failures have been many this year
   -- the front beds are a mess, with bare spots from lost perennials
   which quickly fill with purslane, spurge and foxtail grass (and I hate
   foxtail grass -- it makes such a mess in Zasu Pitts Pootie's long, soft
   fur).  The French cantaloupe were killed by powdery mildew, few of the
   cauliflower escaped the predation of feet and/or pooties, and for
   whatever reason the standard tomatoes are taking forever to ripen."

   Energy

   [43]Breaking: Japanese Government takes over Fukushima cleanup--by
   Horace Boothroyd III: "After over two years of being continually lied
   to by the corporation claiming to stabilize the critically damaged
   plant, Japan takes over. Now that we know that radioactive water has
   been leaking since day one into a water table adjacent the Pacific
   Ocean and unknown exposure to the population of the Pacific Rim could
   be worse than that of Chernobyl. We do know that they were planning to
   attempt pick up sticks with fuel rods in an environment that destroys
   robots and the first responding engineers alike."

   [44]Entergy's Vermont Yankee Nuclear Plant closing down by the end of
   2014--by Lefty Coaster: "This is very good news. Plan to close Vermont
   Yankee marks latest blow to nuclear power: The Vermont Yankee nuclear
   power plant in Vernon, Vt., will be shut down by the end of next year
   due to financial factors, the company that owns the plant announced
   Tuesday, in the latest sign of a difficult economic climate for nuclear
   power companies. Entergy Corp., the New Orleans-based company that owns
   Vermont Yankee, plans on closing and decommissioning the plant by the
   fourth quarter of 2014, in cooperation with the US Nuclear Regulatory
   Commission. It is the fifth nuclear plant this year to close or to have
   plans made for its closure."

   [45]Nuclear energy: Lessons from Japan (and Murphy)--by Ivy Main: "A
   friend asked me recently whether I thought the ongoing disaster at the
   Fukishima nuclear plant in Japan would have repercussions here in
   Virginia, where Dominion Power operates four nuclear reactors at two
   plants and wants to build another. I feel pretty sure the answer is no.
   Economics will kill Dominion's nuclear dream, but not risk. We just
   don't think that way. We think like this: Fukishima was taken out by a
   tsunami. There are no tsunamis in central Virginia. Ergo, there is no
   risk to Virginia's nuclear plants from a tsunami, so Japan's sudden
   revulsion against nuclear power shouldn't put us off our feed half a
   world away. So why did countries like Germany, which also has no
   tsunamis, freak out and swear off nuclear for good? They drew an
   entirely different lesson: Japan is a smart, technologically-advanced
   nation. Japan did not anticipate the disaster that destroyed Fukishima.
   Ergo, unanticipated disasters happen even in smart,
   technologically-advanced nations."

   Renewables

   [46]Wind, Water, Solar how New York State could get the fossil fuel
   monkey off its back--by Horace Boothroyd III: "Much has been said to
   try and insist that there would be no way to replace everything we do
   with electric. That it is impossible to use solar in northern climes
   and that wind is too intermittent. But no studies have been done to
   assay the reality of such broad denials of alternatives. New York State
   was known, before warming became the norm, to have harsh snow packed
   winters. It is also densely populated and full of industrial
   infrastructure.  So it is an excellent place to show how wind, water,
   and solar (WWS) can be utilized in such a manner as to ensure total
   renewable energy utilization. To completely cut away the, expensive in
   all aspects, fossil fuel umbilical cord."

   Fracking

   [47]We Deserve Facts on Marcellus Shale Air Quality Impacts--by
   jessewhite: "There has been a sudden burst of activity in the media in
   recent days regarding air and water pollution from the heavy industrial
   sites involved in the Marcellus Shale drilling process. Beyond the
   drilling sites themselves, the focus has been on compressor stations
   and processing plants, as well as the wastewater impoundments where
   millions of gallons of hazardous waste from far beyond the local
   community are being hauled in at an alarming rate. The enormous natural
   gas processing plant in Chartiers Township operated by MarkWest, the
   midstream company for Range Resources, has been the center of much of
   the attention. Following last month's problems which included large
   clouds of black smoke visible for miles away, a new problem related to
   a power failure caused more heavy black smoke emissions last week.
   MarkWest said the problem requires specific manufacturing of parts and
   could take several months to fix, asking residents to be patient. In a
   move that surprised nobody who has ever dealt with them, the PA
   Department of Environmental Protection said they have no intention of
   taking any specific action to ensure the problem is fixed."

   [48]New Fracking Deregulation Used by Corporation That Lobbied For It
   to Sue PA Families--by ProgressivePatriotPA: "This is a video from my
   show Counterpoint PA, the only grassroots progressive newscast
   exclusively about Pennsylvania politics. In this video, I report about
   a new deregulation of the controversial natural gas drilling process
   called hydraulic fracturing or fracking in Pennsylvania that was used
   immediately after it passed by a corporation that lobbied for it to sue
   scores of Pennsylvania families and a Pennsylvania business to get to
   the natural gas under their land, and give due credit to PA House
   Republican who voted against it for now seeking cosponsors to repeal
   it."

   Keystone and Other Fossil Fuel Transportation

   [49]Why Keystone Flunks the Climate Test--by Michael Brune: "In June
   President Obama set a climate test for his decision on the Keystone XL
   tar sands pipeline. He said he will not approve the pipeline if it
   would significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution. Today
   the Sierra Club, Oil Change International, and 13 partner groups have
   released a report that settles the issue unequivocally: Keystone XL
   would be a climate disaster. Our report, "FAIL: How the Keystone XL Tar
   Sands Pipeline Flunks the Climate Test," spells out the full
   consequences of building the pipeline."

   [50]Good news! Decision on Keystone XL pipeline delayed until 2014--by
   VL Baker: "Bloomberg breaks the good news that the Obama administration
   is probably delaying the decision on Keystone XL pipeline until 2014.
   Seems that they are bogged down in the investigations into conflicts of
   interest, improper financial ties and downright lies. Doesn't appear
   that even delaying until 2014 is giving enough time.The State
   Department's Office on the Inspector General announced Friday that it
   was reviewing whether recommendations it made in a separate February
   2012 report into conflict questions about another Keystone contractor
   are being followed as the department conducts an environmental review
   of the US$5.3-billion project. That review won't be completed until
   January, Douglas Welty, a spokesman for the watchdog agency, said in an
   e-mail. The inspector general's office earlier this month said it
   opened an inquiry into allegations made by Friends of the Earth and
   other Keystone critics that ERM Group Inc., which is writing the
   supplemental impact statement, has financial ties to TransCanada Corp.,
   Keystone's sponsor."

   Eco-Related DC & State Politics

   [51]Over 100 groups call for California moratorium on fracking--by Dan
   Bacher: "As oil companies expand fracking operations in California,
   environmental, health and progressive groups released a letter on
   Wednesday, August 28 calling SB 4's regulations "insufficient" and
   demanding that Governor Jerry Brown immediately impose a moratorium on
   fracking in California. More than 100 groups, including CREDO, Food and
   Water Watch, Center for Biological Diversity, MoveOn.org, California
   Water Impact Network (C-WIN), Environmental Protection Information
   Center, Butte Environmental Council and Physicians for Social
   Responsibility-Los Angeles, signed the letter. SB 4, a weak bill
   sponsored by Senator Fran Pavley, was the only fracking bill that
   wasn't defeated in Committee under intense pressure by the Western
   States Petroleum Association and oil companies. The association, headed
   by President Catherine Reheis-Boyd, is the wealthiest and most powerful
   corporate lobby in California."

   [52]A kid from Colorado and a river in Alaska--by Mark Mehringer:
   "CleanSlateNow.org just released their third story on how special
   interest PAC money influences Congress. The first two focused on
   Republican Mike Coffman and Democrat Diana DeGette. This one is about
   Cory Gardner.  Here is an excerpt: The Colville River flows through
   much of the Brooks Range. Alaska's largest Arctic River is home to 20
   fish species. Known as an internationally-recognized area for nesting
   birds of prey, the Colville River's bluffs provide significant nesting
   habitat for raptors such as Peregrine Falcon, Gyrfalcon and Golden
   Eagle. - from On Arctic Ground. The river delta has been designated an
   'Aquatic Resource of National Importance.'One would have thought that
   this is one of the few places on Earth where other species might be
   safe from encroaching human development....and that would have been
   true except for the hundreds of millions of barrels of oil under the
   cold, sparsely-populated tundra."

   [53]Eric Cantor skips March on Washington to follow the oil money--by
   VL Baker: "In their responses the invited Republican lawmakers cited
   schedule conflicts or ill health. The excuse offered by House Majority
   Leader, Eric Cantor could not have been more telling. Cantor had a
   meeting with oil lobbyists in North Dakota, which prevented his
   attendance."

   [54]GOP senator says he's a climate change denier because he cares
   about workers. Yeah, right--by Mark E Andersen: "[An] ad calls out Sen.
   Johnson (R-WI) for being a global warming denier. On Tuesday, Sen.
   Johnson responded to the ad: They're calling me a global warming
   denier, I believe that's what they're saying. And they say he isn't
   smart. He catches on pretty quick. But Johnson says he's still not
   convinced, and he's against any policy that could hurt the American
   worker. 'Listen, I view myself as a strong environmentalist, I want to
   protect the environment. I want a pristine environment. I love to fish,
   I love the outdoors,  I get my water out of a well. Listen, I'm all
   about protecting the environment.. but you need a strong healthy
   economy in order to afford that.' So in order to have clean air to
   breathe, clean water to drink, and an unpolluted environment to play
   in--we must first destroy it in order to be able to protect it so that
   the economy is healthy? Wouldn't it be easier to just do the right
   thing now and take care of what we have?"

   The Great Outdoors

   [55]Glacier National Park: Photos from the Bus--by Ojibwa.
   Sequoia National Park
   [56]Sequoia National Park Hiking in the Giant Forest and a trip to Pear
   Lake (Photo Diary)--by jbob: "I spent some time at Sequoia National
   Park in late June this year. I am just now getting around to posting
   some photos from that trip. Car camping at the Lodgepole Campground is
   fun and there are lots of nice sites."

   [57]Hetch Hetchy - Yosemite National Park (photo diary)--by jbob: "The
   Rim Fire now burning near this area of yosemite is the biggest fire in
   the nation. The last update I saw had it about 1 mile from the
   reservoir. Here are some photos I took while visiting there a few years
   ago. I am, worried that they won't be able to contain this fire. That
   got me thinking that it would be good to post some photos."
   Hetch Hetchy
   bridge in Mt. Baker National Forest
   [58]The Daily Bucket - Alpine Flora Around Mt. Baker National
   Forest--by RonK: "On the way up to Artist Point there is the obligatory
   stop at Picture Lake that on clear days is the foreground for classic
   photos of Mt. Shucksan, said to be the most photographed mountain in
   the country. The mist rolled in and out so if one waited, you could see
   the lake and wild flowers.  Along with lots of huckleberries just
   becoming ripe, the Red fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) was out in
   all its splendor around the lake. I think I also might have found the
   bridge to nowhere from Alaska with Huckleberries along the side."
   Mossy Trees in the Hoh Rain Forest
   Hoh Rain Forest
   [59]Dawn Chorus: Olympic National Park--by Senor Unoball: "We had never
   been to this national park, and had never seen some of the birds living
   in the extreme northwest part of the U.S., so it was with a lot of
   excitement that we spent about a week recently in Olympic National
   Park. [...] While we love our state, we figured it would be nice to get
   to a place that is not only cooler, but is still green in the summer
   rather than be all yellow and dried out. It's a long drive from the SF
   Bay Area, so we had to stay overnight in Oregon both coming and going.
   But the drive, up Interstate 5, and then Highway 101 from Olympia, WA,
   becomes more beautiful by the mile. We were originally going to camp at
   the park's Kalaloch campground, because it takes reservations, but we
   changed our minds and ended up with a hotel in Sequim, WA. I think that
   was actually a pretty wise decision, as we would have spent a week on
   the coast being damp and cold."

   [60]The Daily Bucket: Drying Out--by matching mole: "Volunteer Chive is
   flowering in one of my Aloe pots.  This is a testament as to how easy
   it is to transport seeds.  The chives grew in my garden in Illinois and
   frequently grew in pots left outdoors in the summer.  The Aloe has been
   moved to a new pot (it was shipped here bare root) so the seed must
   have been attached to the root. [...] Turkey Vulture flying over the
   lake.  Numerous great egrets visible as well as a single Anhinga and a
   Belted Kingfisher."
   Lookout Mountain
   [61]The Daily Bucket--Once there was an ocean, now there is no ocean
   there--by 6412093: "I've always considered Phoenix, Arizona, to be a
   outpost of the first circle of Hell. It had gotten over 120 degrees a
   few times, and routinely exceeds 100 for 90 days every year. Too many
   roads are pool-table-level 10 mile stretches of desultory 1 and 2 story
   retail establishments; tire store, smoke shop, tattoo parlor, Goodwill,
   and so on. The controversial Joe Arpaio is the sheriff for the
   surrounding county. However, when I was there last weekend, for the
   first time I stumbled onto some of Phoenix's unique geology. Not too
   many cities can feature a chain of volcano cones that poke into the sky
   from the suburbs to downtown and on to the other edge of town. Rome may
   have seven hills, but Phoenix has 12 extinct volcanoes. That's Lookout
   Mountain, north of downtown, and part of the Phoenix Mountain Preserve.
   The Phoenix Mountains arc for 8 miles across urban and suburban
   neighborhoods."

   Critters
   adult eag in tree
   [62]Down by the Sea ~ eagles and vultures on the beach--by OceanDiver:
   "We were taking a walk after dinner down to the beach, still broad
   daylight even at 8 pm so near midsummer's day. Heard a commotion in the
   trees above, looked up and saw this juvenile eagle perched 20 feet
   above where it had just landed. I'd been seeing this eagle family
   recently in the area, two parents and two recently fledged eaglets,
   flying from one beach to another. Here's the dad of the family. Tonight
   there was a lot of activity at the beach we were headed to, usually
   very quiet and empty. All four eagles were alternately flying, perching
   and landing on the far end of the beach."

   [63]Birding by Radar--by Mark Mywurtz: "You might not have a thermal
   imaging camera at your disposal, but there are ways you can observe
   nocturnal migration.  For example, if there is a half to full moon
   outside during the migration period in your area, you can train a
   spotting scope on the moon and zoom until the moon is the full field of
   view.  Watch for a few minutes, and you may see birds flying in front
   of the moon--you might even attempt to identify the closer ones by body
   shape, tail length, etc!  You'll probably notice them all flying
   southward, though sometimes "reverse migration" occurs.  There have
   been nights where I have seen several birds per minute pass in front of
   the moon."

   [64]IMG_1907 [65]The Daily Bucket - a cooper's hawk comes calling--by
   Polly Syllabic: "Flap-flap-glide.......flap-flap-glide.......she flew
   in slowly after launching from the willow on the riverbank. I watched
   her pull up and flutter gracefully onto the deck rail, much like
   mourning doves do. A polite, delicate hawk? Usually, a Cooper's
   incoming strike on a birdfeeder comes in low, hits hard with lightning
   force and explodes the birds in all directions. The best hope is to
   crash a victim into the window to fall unconscious or to tangle others
   in the bushes for an easy pickup meal. Confusion! Bird hunting hawks
   think like that. There's a newbie in my backyard checking out the
   neighborhood."

   [66]Documents Show Natural Gas Lobbying Groups Threatens Endangered
   Species in PA--by S Kitchen: "In my latest article on the Raging
   Chicken Press, I obtained, and published, an email and letter from the
   Marcellus Shale Coalition.  The email and letter is another attempt by
   the fossil fuels industry in Pennsylvania to get every last drop of gas
   out of the ground, even if it means destroying the habitats of the
   Commonwealth's 62 state-specific threatened and endangered species."
   Wilson's Warbler
   Wilson's Warbler
   [67]The Daily Bucket: Summer Woods--by Milly Watt: "Summer is marked by
   long days.  On the first day of summer, we had over 16 hours between
   sunrise and sunset.  The high angle of the summer sun clears the tall
   cedars on our southern property line and shines on my front yard where
   my raised garden beds lay. But, down in the woods, the deciduous maple
   and alder trees have leafed out and closed up most of the breaks in the
   evergreen canopy.  Even in this relatively dry season, the morning (or
   all day) fog often rolls in and softens whatever sunlight makes it
   through the trees. So, there is still a lot of shade. [...] On this
   particular walk at the end of June, there was a pair of Wilson's
   warblers following me and fussing for quite a ways along the trail."

   [68]The Daily Bucket: Meta-morphosis--by FOYI: "Gulf Fritillary
   Caterpillar Morphing--This video was made by compiling 321 photos into
   a 1 minute 30 second fast speed slideshow. The actual change taking
   place lasted roughly three minutes and took place on August 12, 2013
   beginning at 9:55 AM."

   [70]Outbreak of measles-like virus in Mid-Atlantic bottlenose
   dolphins--by Kysen: "I live in Virginia Beach and have been watching
   with interest the recent numbers of dolphins washing up dead along the
   Mid-Atlantic shoreline. There have been over 300 found in recent months
   from NY to NC. From the Virginia Beach coast to the Eastern Shore, 26
   were found in one weekend alone. Doctors from out of state are already
   aiding with the dolphin autopsies, known as necropsies. Dead dolphins
   were left at the door of the marine care center, because the freezers
   are already full. Most of the dolphins affected are males of all ages.
   'We're seeing lesions in their respiratory systems. We're seeing joint
   problems. We're not seeing animals feeding normally,' said Barco. 'A
   lot of them are thin.'"

   [71]Weekend Hummingbirds--by not4morewars: "We are getting into the
   time of year here in central IA when the hummingbirds are starting to
   fatten up for the fall migration to Cancun."
   Hummingbird
   [72]Backyard Birding: It's Almost Sprinkler Time--by Mark Mywurtz:
   "Fall migration is barely underway here in Minnesota. Of course,
   shorebirds have been moving for a while and some species have been
   quietly wandering and withdrawing from their breeding range. Common
   Nighthawks are migrating en masse and little mixed flocks of passerines
   are congregating for anyone lucky enough to stumble on such a group. I
   don't know what the birding phenology is like in your part of the
   world, but by early September, northern warblers and other songbirds
   will become easier to find migrating through here. By late September
   and early October, they will be joined by a variety of sparrows and
   warblers that breed well north of here."

   [73]The Daily Bucket: gulls passing through--by OceanDiver: "MacKaye
   Harbor. Salish Sea. Pacific Northwest. A large flock of gulls
   congregated in this bay the other day. I'd seen a similar flock a few
   days earlier, but was on my way somewhere and couldn't stop to get a
   good look - an hour later on my way back that flock had departed. The
   flock this day was tightly bunched up, approximately a hundred, fairly
   close to shore. I approached them in my kayak as quietly as I could,
   and snapped photos at maximum zoom as I drifted toward them broadside.
   It became clear they were bathing, not feeding. Lots of water getting
   splashed, wings spread as they lifted partly out of the water, some
   horseplay."

   [74]'Clean' version of the Delta Plan isn't fooling anybody--by Dan
   Bacher: "The Delta Stewardship Council on Wednesday August 28 released
   what it described as a "clean" version of the Final Delta Plan, a
   controversial document now being contested in seven lawsuits by diverse
   parties ranging from the Winnemem Wintu Tribe to the Westlands Water
   District. So does that mean that the previous version of the plan was
   "dirty," as in obscene, corrupt, poorly written, ill-conceived and
   driven by dirty corporate money?"

   Eco-Activism & Eco-Justice

   [75]Sunflowers and Cops: Climate/EJ Frontline Richmond 8/3/2013--by
   RandW: "350.org's Summer Heat series of 11 climate actions across the
   country concluded August 3rd with Summer Heat Richmond.  It turned out
   to be the largest Environmental Justice (EJ) rally (2800 attended
   according to Richmond PD) in that traditionally
   Chevron-refinery-dominated town to date. Over 200 protesters underlined
   the importance of the message, risking their freedom by being arrested
   in civil disobedience. While Richmond groups such as APEN and
   Communities for a Better Environment have been battling Chevron's
   influence and electorial money for three decades, this action marked
   the first time a coalition of Bay Area climate, labor, faith and
   national organizations participated. The event was diaried on DK by
   dturbull, showed up in media from San Jose Mercury News to Rachel
   Maddow - all the press and photo & video are referenced here on 350 Bay
   Area's website."

   [76]El Yasuní es la gallina de los huevos de oro--by angelajean: "For
   those of you who haven't been keeping up with the conversation about
   oil development in Ecuador, I hope you decide to read this and learn
   more. Last week, President Rafael Correa cancelled an agreement with
   Germany that would have created a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in the
   Yasuní National Park. The agreement, referred to as Yasuní ITT, was a
   groundbreaking experiment in economic development; the government of
   Ecuador asked the international community for the equivalent of 50% of
   the potential oil revenue in exchange for not developing the
   Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini oil reserves. Since Correa's decision to
   cancel the agreement, a local newspaper in Quito, HOY, has had a
   constant stream of articles about the Yasuní, the National Park, and
   oil exploitation. Yes, they call it exactly that. This Sunday alone,
   the first three pages of the paper were about this single topic."

   [77]When Beer and Natural Gas collide--by wade norris: "What happens
   when Oil and Gas companies contaminate the Water that Brewers rely on
   for their Beer in the State of Colorado? What happens after the
   citizens of the towns with those Beers (Da' Beers!)  passed ballot
   initiatives to protect their towns? What happens these towns are sued
   to force Fracking against their will and their best interests? Find out
   when the Beer lovers of this great state (more Microbrews per capita in
   the Union) come together for the Frack Free Brew Festival on Sunday
   August 25th 2013 at the Boulder Bandshell Amphitheater--at the heart of
   the University of Colorado's campus."

   [78]If We Break the Laws of Nature, Are We Justified in Breaking the
   Laws of Humanity?--by Kelly Rigg: "When an email from Tony Leiserowitz
   popped up on screen the other day, I was blown away to read the
   findings of his team's latest national survey of U.S. opinion on
   climate change: 'One in eight people (13%) say they would be willing to
   personally engage in non-violent civil disobedience against corporate
   or government activities that make global warming worse.' That's more
   than 40 million Americans potentially willing to take to the streets
   and risk arrest. To put this in perspective, when 50,000 people turned
   up at the National Mall to protest the Keystone XL pipeline last
   February, it was hailed as the 'largest climate rally in US history.'"

   [79]Copple policy #1: military and civilian use of nuclear power--by
   augustin: "Roger Copple, as one of his 27 policy initiatives, proposes:
   Dismantle all nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants, simultaneously
   and voluntarily, the world over as soon as possible. First of all,
   Roger Copple covers simultaneously civilian and military nuclear
   programs. For the purpose of our Community Manifesto initiative, I
   though it best to break this into two separate polls, dealing with,
   respectively military use and civilian use: What is your position on
   nuclear armament?. What is your position on nuclear energy?"

   [80]"They fear us because we are fearless": Reclaiming indigenous lands
   and strength in Honduras--by Bev Bell: ""Honduras has been known for
   two things only: being a military base for the [contra] attacks on the
   Nicaraguan revolution, and Hurricane Mitch." So said Berta Caceres,
   co-founder and general coordinator of the Civic Council of Popular and
   Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH by its Spanish acronym).
   COPINH is an organization of hundreds of communities of Lenca
   indigenous peoples and small farmers. The rest of the story, of the
   resistance of land reform and indigenous movements, what is at stake,
   and the source of much of the violence, are largely unknown in the US."

   [81]Open thread for night owls: Look out! Here comes Hurricane Paul
   Ryan--by Meteor Blades: "Hurricane Kristi Noem. Hurricane Ted Cruz.
   Hurricane Paul Broun. Hurricane Kelly Ayotte. Hurricane Darrell Issa.
   Hurricane Vicki Hartzler. Those are a few names of congressional
   blowhards that the eco-advocacy group 350 Action at
   ClimateNameChange.org would like to see the World Meteorological
   Organization start attaching to the big storms that scientists believe
   are going to get worse and possibly more frequent as climate chaos
   continues on its course. They've set up a petition in this regard. Why?
   Because those representatives and senators deny that the climate is
   changing. Or they concede that it is, but say humans aren't the cause.
   Or they concede that it is, that humans are causing it, but say it's no
   big deal. Or they concede that it is, that humans are causing it, that
   it is a big deal, but there is nothing that can be done about it.
   Or...well...whatever the latest denier trope is."

   [82]Federal Coal--10 tons for a penny--by 6412093: "Step right up, buy
   your coal!  Think there's nothing you can get for a penny these days?
   Wrong, wrong, wrong.  The federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is
   selling 167 million tons of Wyoming coal, and the minimum bid is one
   penny for 10 tons. [...] Here's the gory details.  The BLM is offering
   to lease 1253 acres, containing 167 million tons of coal, 12 miles
   north of Gillette, Wyoming, for a minimum bid of a lousy $100 an acre.
    It's called the Hay Creek II Coal Tract. Multinational construction
   giant Kiewit, through its mining subsidiaries, already runs the nearby
   Buckskin Mine, and wants that coal.  BLM is obligated to offer those
   lands for competitive bid, before just surrendering it to Kiewit for a
   pittance. There are some other costs in the fine print: a $3/acre
   annual payment, and royalty payments of 12.5%.  Those royalty payments
   could eventually reach millions per year paid to BLM."

   Transportation & Infrastructure

   [Tilt_train.jpg] [83]Sunday Train: Florida Rapid Rail project moves
   toward a 2015 ribbon cutting--by BruceMcF: "A year and a half ago, I
   had two speculations as to what was behind this privately-funded
   passenger rail project ~ the first privately-funded passenger rail
   project in quite a long time. The first speculation was that this
   involved looking to make money through property development. The idea
   here is that Rapid Passenger Rail between appropriate end points three
   hours or less apart can be operated on a break-even basis. Therefore,
   if providing the service creates additional value for property at or
   near to stations along the route, the extra profit on those
   developments may well justify establishing and providing the service.
   The second speculation involved the expansion of the Panama Canal and
   works to increase the capacity of the Miami cargo port for the new,
   larger, "Panamax" container ships made possible by the expansion. The
   idea was that the passenger service might be bait to help the Florida
   East Coast regional freight railway to gain access to Class I freight
   lines near Orlando. The two bids made public this week support the
   first speculation."

   [84]Why Tesla Is Not Enough--by wcalvin: "The Tesla itself may have
   zero emissions but the electrical energy has to come from somewhere.
   Here in Seattle, 98 percent of our electricity comes from sun-powered
   renewables: hydroelectric, photoelectric, and wind. Switzerland also
   has 98 percent clean electricity, half from hydro and half from
   nuclear, also clean except for the mining of uranium. But most places
   get their electricity from some less guilt-free mix of clean and
   traditional.  If I recharge while driving through Wyoming, nearly all
   of the electricity will come from burning the most damaging fossil fuel
   of all, coal. And until the environmental cost of producing its
   batteries comes down (Panasonic uses Japan's electricity mix, now very
   heavy on fossil fuels), the emissions from manufacturing a Tesla are
   higher than for a hybrid. That will change as new battery factories are
   built in the clean energy regions that supply Tesla's aluminum."

   [85]WOW! 2014 Chevy Volt starts at just $34,995!!--by Brainwrap: "This
   is awesome. I know Tesla is the fave-rave around these parts when it
   comes to electric cars, and I think it's pretty amazing as well.
   However, as a guy born & raised in the Metro Detroit area, I'm also
   strongly rooting for the Chevy Volt. There's nothing wrong with hoping
   that both cars are huge successes and go mainstream. There's plenty of
   arguments in favor of pure-electric, but there's also plenty of
   arguments in favor of the Extended Range Volt as well. Everyone knew
   that they'd drop the price on the 2014 model substantially, but no one
   was expecting it to hit the $35K mark already. Another few years and
   they may be able to make it down to $30K without the tax credits!"

   Eco-Philosophy & Essays

   [86]TPP & Environment - What It Means to Us--by LeftieIndie: "There's
   many parts to the TPP, but to date, and general knowledge, there are
   only 5 sections that deal with actual trade. The rest of the sections
   vary from Pharmaceuticals, to Copyright and extensions, to ISP's as
   intermediary internet police forces for copyright. There are
   purportedly 20-25 sections of the TPP in all, and we are finally being
   given a glimpse of the Environmental side by our US Trade
   Representative and asked to publicly comment on it. [...] What can we
   do? Respond on that link for the review about your concerns. Start
   putting pressure on your Congressional representatives and Senators for
   asking for transparency on this. This can not be forced to go into an
   up/down vote sight unseen and without public consumption or debate.
   There are enough out there already questioning this, but it needs to be
   brought into the public eye and not "sold" to the public as the next
   best wheel invention, because it's not."

   [87]Introduction to Agroecology: "A Serengeti on Our Doorsteps"--George
   Monbiot & Rewilding the Earth--by FinchJ: "At first glance, rewilding
   and anything with the prefix "agro" would seem to be diametrically
   opposed to this goal. However, the concepts of rewilding and
   agroecology share the same fate: for either to become the "new normal,"
   the other must be embraced. They are mutually reinforcing,
   revolutionary concepts which are absolutely essential if humanity is
   going to accept responsibility for its collective actions and begin to
   clean up this planet and fix the natural cycles we have broken before
   it is too late. In this diary, I want to share how George Monbiot's
   Feral: Searching for enchantment on the frontiers of rewilding
   regarding his quest to alleviate his 'ecological boredom' is not just
   an isolated case, how rewilding relates to agroecology, and how--taken
   together--the two concepts will be the foundation upon which a
   regenerative future must be built."

   Products & Miscellany

   [88]Yet Another Reason to Kick Shampoo--by karmsy: "There seems to be
   yet another reason to kick shampoo, if you're using it every day. [...]
   According to the  Center for Environmental Health in Oakland, it seems
   most brands available in the store contain the ingredient Cocamide DEA,
   which has been identified by the International Agency for Research on
   Cancer as a suspected human carcinogen. The scalp is an area of the
   body richly supplied with blood, possibly compounding the exposure of
   somebody who shampoos regularly. My tip? Stop buying shampoo
   altogether. Stop using it. As I advised in a green-living-themed diary
   earlier this summer, your hair really can look just fine without it. If
   you kick the shampoo habit, you'll cut your personal chemical exposure
   and help the environment, too. Probably, you'll also save money."

   [89]A Liter of Light--by thenekkidtruth: "While Ireland recently banned
   plastic bags, here's how the little town of Sitio Maligaya,
   municipality of Mariveles, Bataan Province, the Philippines dealt with
   their unwanted plastic. A little inexpensive bleach "softens" the
   light, making it more uniform and diffuse, and lessens the glare.  It's
   as bright as an incandescent bulb!  FYI, the residents of the town are
   speaking native Tagalog."

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [104]Civil
   Rights, [105]Community, [106]Congress, [107]Culture, [108]Economy,
   [109]Education, [110]Elections, [111]Energy, [112]Environment,
   [113]Health Care, [114]International, [115]Labor, [116]Law, [117]Media,
   [118]Meta, [119]National Security, [120]Science, [121]Transportation,
   or [122]White House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider
   adding the state ([123]California, [124]Texas, etc). Keep in mind,
   though, that there are many wonderful and important diaries that don't
   fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Desert Tortoises.

   Good gawd couldn't they just give them to people with care and feeding
   instructions? Back in the 60's before people were aware of how bad it
   was to lift these guys out of their habitat, many of my friends had one
   of these out in the backyard where with a water source and lots of
   lettuce they lived just fine. I just can't fathom the deaths of these
   wonderful, gentle creatures. It makes me want to cry.

     "Federal funds are running out at the Desert Tortoise Conservation
     Center and officials plan to close the site and euthanize hundreds
     of the tortoises they've been caring for since the animals were
     added to the endangered species list in 1990.
     "It's the lesser of two evils, but it's still evil," said U.S. Fish
     and Wildlife Service desert tortoise recovery coordinator Roy
     Averill-Murray during a visit to the soon-to-be-shuttered reserve at
     the southern edge of the Las Vegas Valley last week.

     Biologists went about their work examining tortoises for signs of
     disease as Averill-Murray walked among the reptile pens. But the
     scrubby 220-acre refuge area will stop taking new animals in the
     coming months. Most that arrive in the fall will simply be put down,
     late-emerging victims of budget problems that came from the same
     housing bubble that put a neighborhood of McMansions at the edge of
     the once-remote site."

       hat tips are nice, but just because you posted in a comment, for
       example, this story about tortoise, does not mean that is where
       jpmassar got the story.
       this question arises some times when fp story same issue/subject as
       diary that gets posted first. but some times fp stories actually
       written before diary posted but sat in fp queue for awhile.
       i think what matters is that the story gets out, yes?
