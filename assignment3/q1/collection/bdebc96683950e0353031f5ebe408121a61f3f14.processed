[22]Not all black Americans happy with commemoration of March on Washington

   [29]Oh, c'mon.

     Black conservatives are rankled by the liberal flavor of events
     commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington.

     They contend the left is appropriating the Rev. Martin Luther King
     Jr.'s memory and willfully understating the degree of progress the
     United States has made in overcoming the egregious racial injustices
     that characterized an earlier era.

   We do all realize that the original speeches were recorded, right? That
   there are still people around now who were around then? That Rep. John
   Lewis spoke 50 years ago, and spoke again this week? If you're peeved
   that the March on Washington was too darn liberal, take it up with
   them, and while we don't have separate drinking fountains these days
   you'd have to be a bit dense to not notice all the places where 50
   years of progress still seems alarmingly tenuous. Republican
   up-and-comer Mia Love does a lovely job of staying on GOP message, I
   will grant her that:

     "I believe Dr. King would be saddened by the way that some of these
     leaders are telling Americans that they are victims and their only
     hope for a better future is a government handout," she said. "It
     does nothing but keep black Americans dependent."

   ...which if I recall correctly was a good chunk of the conservative
   message at the time as well, so bonus points for a half-century of
   ideological consistency. She still doesn't have the full schtick down,
   though. Better Republicans know that the final answer to any question
   on race is to declare that The Problem Has Been Solved, so we can all
   go home now.

     "I think Martin Luther King's dream has been fulfilled," said Ron
     Christie, a Republican strategist who served as special assistant to
     President George W. Bush. "All men and women in this country are now
     treated equally. Legal discrimination has been outlawed."

   Christ, man, that one actually hurt to read, please tell me it at least
   hurt to say?

   More below the fold:

   Of course, if reasonable conservatives like Mia Love and Ron Christie
   had been in charge 50 years ago, irritating liberals like Martin Luther
   King Jr. and John Lewis wouldn't have been allowed to speak. They were
   liberal socialist communist Marxist troublemakers, after all. (And that
   was a concern, as I hope we all still know--Mr. King was considered a
   world-class troublemaker by all the folks who thought things were Just
   Fine, at the time, and by many, many people who knew things were not
   Just Fine but thought King's approach of loudly saying so was even
   worse, and there have always been a sizable number of cretins who
   thought that John Lewis getting his head bashed in by the Authorities
   was exactly what the pot-stirrer deserved, and have been perfectly
   willing to tell you so. Oh, and King was simply a grifter trying to
   rabble-rouse in order to pad his own status. Oh, and a Soviet
   infiltrator, can't forget that one. And was inciting violence against
   the good white folks. And everything else you can think of--remember,
   these people were hated by status-quo conservatives, hated and then
   some, which is why many of them ended up dead and
   not-at-all-coincidentally was the precise reason for the
   Republican-Democratic social divide that still exists to this day. Do
   those men the honor of remembering how hated they were, please, and how
   often they were attacked for being "anti-American," and how many of
   them were beaten or killed because the better and more reasonable
   people knew that they were just trying to "keep black Americans
   dependent" or trying to stir up trouble even though The Problem Had
   Been Solved. Grant them at least that much.)

   If there's anything that conservatives can agree on, in fact, it's that
   leadership figures talking about racial issues is divisive and wrong,
   which is why Obama giving personal remarks on the Trayvon Martin case
   has gotten him branded a troublemaker, and a race-baiter, and all those
   other things:

     [E]ven if those comments were lauded among Obama's supporters, they
     were among several reasons why Herman Cain calls the president's
     record on race relations "lousy."

     He added: "There were expectations that he would set the proper tone
     for race relations in this country. He has not done so. The things
     that he has been outspoken about have simply created more friction."

   Nobody's ever quite sure what the proper tone of race relations should
   be or what "things" you should be outspoken about, but they're always
   pretty sure that whenever someone does talk about it, they're being
   divisive. Every last time, it seems. That seems like a rather glaring
   problem, right there.

   Things have changed in 50 years, to be sure. But people don't change
   very much, from decade to decade, which is why you can take quotes from
   one era and put them in another and often be hard pressed to tell the
   difference. In American politics the liberals are always the
   troublemakers, the conservatives are always the reasonable ones, and
   everyone is always full of opinions on how important historical
   Americans would obviously have taken their side of every argument.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [42]Tagging tips - [43]Search For Tags - [44]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [45]Civil
   Rights, [46]Community, [47]Congress, [48]Culture, [49]Economy,
   [50]Education, [51]Elections, [52]Energy, [53]Environment, [54]Health
   Care, [55]International, [56]Labor, [57]Law, [58]Media, [59]Meta,
   [60]National Security, [61]Science, [62]Transportation, or [63]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([64]California, [65]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       said National Review back on October 1, 1963:

     The fiend who set off the bomb does not have the sympathy of the
     white population in the South; in fact, he set back the cause of the
     white people there so dramatically as to raise the question whether
     in fact the explosion was the act of a provocateur - of a Communist,
     or of a crazed Negro. Some circumstantial evidence lends a hint of
     plausibility to that notion, especially the ten-minute fuse (surely
     a white man walking away form the church basement ten minutes
     earlier would have been noticed?).
       Those whacky lovable conservatives and their c-r-a-z-y ideas!
       You have exactly 10 seconds to change that look of disgusting pity
       into one of enormous respect!

       I don't agree with the president on every issue, but if they redid
       the 2012 election tomorrow I'd happily vote for him again.
       A conservative is typically anti-choice, for instance, and many
       African-Americans are too. But on balance, most African-Americans
       understand that Democrats are interested in their problems, and
       they understand that Republicans are only interested in supressing
       their votes.

   that is why the little girls were found to be wearing "bomber belts"
   The problem is such assertions are laughable but it takes time to
   refute them and that time is time taken away from other causes which
   need attention.  However, if these claims are not refuted, then for
   some folks, the claims begin to have the ring of truth to them.  We see
   this when a majority of Southern GOP continue to believe the POTUS is a
   Kenyan and if they can only impeach and remove him from office, all of
   his appointments and all of the laws passed during his tenure will go
   away and we will return to 01/01/2009

   with a supposedly independent moderate friend of mine about voter
   suppression all day long on the book of face. He is a big one for false
   equivalencies. No matter how I make the case, he twists the evidence
   and comes up with some strawman argument.
   I finally just expressed my surprise that, with his character and
   integrity, he isn't angry about this and calling it out himself. I
   suggested maybe his news sources haven't found the story yet and told
   him they will because a shitstorm is coming to all the states that
   leaped at the opportunity to gleefully enact regulations that obstruct
   voters.

   I can predict that he'll suggest I'm over-reaching and seeing boogiemen
   where none exist.
   He is my friend, but I'm not letting him keep the façade of moderation

   why the fight continues, conservative friends.

   I'd use different words to describe them, but I'll moderated my
   language in honor of Dr. King.

   Conservative lips continue to drip with the words of interposition and
   nullification, even using the same rhetoric of "states' rights" that
   they did 50 years ago.

   50 years later, an African American in North Carolina or Texas cannot
   vote and one in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.

       I am reminded of this every day.  Back in the 70's, when we were
       mostly white, handouts were given all the time.  We had all sorts
       of free and very cheap things in my city for kids and adults to do.
        Bus rides were nearly free for young people. But then the white
       population diminished, and everyone began talking about freeloader,
       like Ronald Reagan's welfare queen of 1976.  It is interesting to
       look a the numbers and the backlash after the african american
       population reached 10%, and now the entrenched stance against
       immigration now that the hispanic population has reached that
       landmark.
       We all need handouts sometimes.  We all know that some handouts are
       critical to short and long term growth of our economy.  The long
       term policy of the past 100 years shows that even conservatives
       believe this.  They would just rather that most of those handout
       were limited to white people.

   Proclamation, it was not at all clear to him what he should do.  The

   something extreme could defeat the south.

   All of this is subject to legitimate historical debate as to timing,

       Lincoln had a coalition to keep together and freeing all the slaves
       everywhere was not something he was prepared to do until he got the
       13th Amendment through.  The Emancipation Proclamation only freed
       slaves in the secessionist states because they were "property" used
       in support of the rebellion.
       Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, Lincoln: a Team of Rivals is quite
       illuminating on that point.

       Lincoln wanted to push the anti-slavery cause forward, but there
       was one thing more important to him: preserving the Union.  If you
       read his speeches, he clearly says that if he could save the Union
       by freeing the slaves, then he would do it, but if the only way he
       could save the union was by not freeing the slaves, then he would
       not do it.  Given that overarching goal, however, he knew that
       abolishing slavery was the only way forward, but not everyone in
       his coalition was of the same mind.

   which purported to show African American CSA troops, according to the
   auctioneer's description.  While the photos were too degraded to read
   actual medals and badges and such, it appeared to me that they were
   more body servants for the officers in the unit rather than actual
   combatants.

   I have been searching for a single example of an African American
   enlisted in the CSA who was taken POW at any point in the war.  So far
   I have not been able to do so.  Anyone else ever research this?

       mercilessly. He's got a bunch of stuff written about it but this is
       a good place to start as any: [599]http://www.theatlantic.com/...

     I think it helps to understand that some 650,000 people fought for
     the Confederacy. I don't think find it impossible, or even, unlikely
     that some black person, somewhere was among that number. What is
     false, and frankly risible, is the notion that these instances rose
     above the scant and anecdotal.
       iirc he later discussed a single newspaper account at the time of a
       100 slaves fighting for the CSA. No corroboration other than that
       one newspaper story. Everything else....scant and anecdotal. Guy
       here or there.
       Arming black people was a non-starter in the CSA gov't because
       doing so would admit that Blacks weren't the simple servile
       creatures the Slavers made them out to be, but MEN. It would
       undermine their entire ideology.
       Yeah, total myth cooked up by people who don't wanna admit their
       ancestors fought for whips and chains.

 Just before the fall of Richmond a few ([603]0+ / 0-)
       blacks were recruited into a small unit that did no fighting and
       only some training.  There is contemporary evidence of this in the
       form of articles in the Richmond Dispatch.  I don' think there
       could have been more than 100 or so, and I suspect that the main
       reason for joining would have been to get food and shelter.

       records.  On the Confederate side, any African American who was
       captured was, in a very few cases, returned to slavery if one of
       the Confederates present lay claim but in more than 99% of the
       cases, they were massacred.
       It seems among Union troops that any Confederate "body servants"
       who were captured were told they had been emancipated and released.
        The lack of African Americans among Confederate POWs would seem to
       indicate that there were no Black Confederates.
       I am aware of The Atlantic article.  What I was looking for, given
       the narrative of "grateful" slaves following their masters into
       battle, was a narrative of the same slaves following their masters
       into captivity as POWs.  So far, it seems the "grateful" body
       servants who were captured chose slavery over internment with their
       masters (and given the practice of prisoner exchanges until 1864
       (from memory), combatants on both sides surrendered expecting to be
       exchanged so slaves who remained with masters would expect to be
       repatriated with their masters.  It seems none opted for this

   Yes there is still discrimination, racism , and inequality.
   MLK not only spoke for the Negro community, he spoke of all who faced

       them then.  The times, they are a different.
       There is no way to compare the level of suffering that black kids
       had then to what black kids have today.  We can only measure that
       suffering exists and that it is disproportionately geared towards
       one particular race.  Kids being patted down and searched everytime
       they walk down the street, going to jail for minor infractions of
       the law, being profiled and at risk of being killed simply for
       doing otherwise legal activities while black.
       Who had it worse solves nothing.  There is injustice being
       perpetrated upon our youth because of the color of their skin.  It
       is wrong.  There is no way to measure the level of wrong because
       injustice is an attribute.  It either is or it isn't.

   this is a class issue rather than a race issue.  They believe that
   because a few individuals like themselves have somehow made it into the
   drawing room for smokes, spirits and a stitlted comraderie, that there
   are no poor blacks and poor others killing, cleaning and cooking their
   chickens out back.
    This dynamic has been around for all history, the dumping on those
   below because one has made it into the favor of some of those above.
   Back in the '70's I worked for the state welfare agency where I
   observed that those fellow caseworkers who were the most critical of
   the welfare recipients had once been recipients themselves.  What they
   failed to realize was that they too were only one personal disaster
   away from becoming a recipient again.  This is probably true for
   Christie and Love and all others who think as they do.

     Of course, if reasonable conservatives like Mia Love and Ron
     Christie had been in charge 50 years ago, irritating liberals like
     Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lewis wouldn't have been allowed to
     speak.

   Not only are Ron and this unknown from Utah easy pickings but it
   irresponsible to assign to them what you feel their values would be
   under completely different circumstances.

   It's entirely possible that the experiences they have faced in their
   lives leads them to believe that the dream has been fulfilled which is
   why they would make such comments.

   The progress this country has made, has allowed for African-Americans
   to succeed and thrive in a world they wouldn't have 50 years ago.

   So if you want to make a mockery of their statements, it would make
   more sense if you just recognized that they do live in a different
   world and that their differing if not misguided views of it are a
   product of the good work that MLK and many others did during that time.

   No need to make them the enemy of black people, because they aren't
   they just live different lives.

   It makes me sick when people want to create these black enemies as if
   we must be pigeon holed into thinking just one way.  Part of being free
   is being free, just cause they don't agree doesn't mean they are my
