   Daily Kos Radio's Kagro in the Morning show podcasts are now available
   through iTunes.

   Reset your Days Without a School Shooting clocks, everybody. Maybe you
   didn't notice it, but some nut stormed a school bus in Alabama
   yesterday, [29]shot the driver, snatched a six year old boy and took
   off, holing himself up in some kind of wacko survivalist bunker.

   Oh, and hey, I've got some articles of interest for you, too. More tabs
   than I know what to do with. But you know, we always find something to
   do with them, anyway. Don't we? Here's one to whet the appetite:
   [30]The Extremist Cult of Capitalism. Come on! You can't go wrong with
   that kind of thing!

   We're LIVE at 9 a.m. ET with Kagro in the Morning, thanks to
   NetrootsRadio.com.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [55]Tagging tips - [56]Search For Tags - [57]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

 good morning! ([81]4+ / 0-)

       in addition to APR ([86]link), there's [87]This is not your
       father's NRA from our new Sen, Chris Murphy.
       there's Gov politics/polls:

     Republican disapproval of New York's tough new gun-control law could
     be taking a toll on Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose all-time high 74 - 13
     percent job approval rating last month drops to a still-solid 59 -
     28 percent in a Quinnipiac University poll released today.

     Voters in non-gun homes approve of the governor 68 - 19 percent.
     Voters in households with a gun disapprove 50 - 40 percent.
     Republican approval of the governor, 68 - 18 percent in a survey by
     the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University on December
     12, just two days before the Newtown massacre, is a split 44 - 43
     percent today.
       [88]http://www.quinnipiac.edu/...
       and

     Gun-control laws in the Keystone State and in the nation should be
     stricter, Pennsylvania voters say, with overwhelming 19-1 support
     for laws requiring background checks for all gun buyers, according
     to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.

     Pennsylvania gun-control laws should be stricter, 57 percent of
     voters tell the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University
     poll, while 4 percent say less strict and 35 percent say keep state
     laws as they are. National gun-control laws should be stricter, 60
     percent of statewide voters say, with 5 percent saying less strict
     and 32 percent saying keep current laws.
     There is strong support in Pennsylvania for a number of measures at
     the national level:
     95 - 5 percent for requiring background checks for all gun
     purchases;
     60 - 37 percent for a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons;
     59 - 39 percent for a nationwide ban on the sale of magazines with
     more than 10 rounds.
     There is less support on most gun-control questions among voters in
     households where there is a gun, but 95 percent of voters in these
     gun households support stricter background checks.

     "Necessity is the mother of political invention," said Bill Whalen,
     a fellow at the Hoover Institution. "Republicans are looking at a
     third straight presidential defeat if they don't improve their image
     with Hispanic voters." He added, "You don't have a lot of
     Republicans walking around town saying he lost an election because
     of our bad relationship with the gun control lobby."

     A gun bill that is limited to background checks, however, still
     remains a strong possibility in Congress this year, if the
     Republican leadership of the House would bring such a measure on the
     floor. "I was a co-sponsor of a conceal carry bill in Nebraska that
     had a significant background check component," said Senator Deb
     Fischer, a newly elected Republican from Nebraska.
     Such a measure, many gun experts say, may actually do the most to
     stem gun violence, because it would help keep weapons out of the
     hands of the mentally ill and criminals. "We might be in a happy
     place where effectiveness conforms with political feasibility," said
     Jon S. Vernick, the co-director of Johns Hopkins Center for Gun
     Policy and Research.
