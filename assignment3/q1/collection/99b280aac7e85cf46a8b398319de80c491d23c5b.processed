     When it comes to making donations, many of us have felt some angst
     in deciding where our money can do the most good. We often hear
     stories of 'charities' that are less than...  charitable. In a
     recent report by Adrienne Hill on NPR's [30]Marketplace, Americans
     give more to charities, per capita, than any other developed
     country. In 2011, we gave $200 billion dollars.

     Tampa Bay Times compiled a list of the Top 50 worst charities. Many
     names of the worst charities are very similar to legitimate
     charities. For instance, the number one worst charity, Kids Wish
     Network, sounds much too similar to, [31]Make A Wish Foundation a
     legitimate respected organization, where donations go to helping
     very sick children see one of their dreams come true. With the Kids
     Wish Network, only 2.5% the $127.8 million they raised, went to
     direct cash aid. So where did the other millions go? $109 million of
     it went to paying solicitors to raise the money.

     According to [32]Kendall Taggart, of The Center For Investigating
     Reporting, many charities exist pretty much to pad the pockets and
     salaries of their founders. Often the value of goods that are
     shipped overseas cannot be verified. And then there are charitable
     goods shipped domestically that are outright insults to the
     recipients. One cancer victim in Knoxville, Tennessee, reached out
     to Cancer Fund of American to help with medical costs. He received a
     package containing paper cups, napkins and plates, along with
     children's toys, you know, things that help a cancer patient pay for
     medical costs. The patient's wife was so disgusted, she threw the
     entire package away.

     Thankfully, there are a few reputable organizations online that can
     help us search charities to differentiate the good from the
     unscrupulous.

     Here are the 50 of the worst charities, with the first being the
     worst. They are ranked by how much they raise, how much goes to pay
     the fund-raising solicitors, and how much goes to the actual
     charity. The title link above the list, will bring you to a page
     with an interactive chart and  more information about charities in
     general.

     Rheumatoid  Disease
     49. Firefighters Burn Fund
     50. Hope Cancer Fund

     One of the most disturbing aspects of this list, is that the names
     of most of these pseudo charities are designed to pull the
     heartstrings of donors who think their money is going to help very
     sick children, women with breast cancer, veterans... when very
     little, if any is actually going to those in need. Makes me want to
     scream out their names on the highest mountain. I'll have to settle
     with posting them here, as the best way to deal with this problem,
     is to become informed and ask charities questions like, "How much of
     my donation is actually going to this cause?." I'm grateful to all
     those who have taken the time to compile this information, which
     helps many of us to discern where, and where not, to place our
     donations.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Americans are generous, but there is only a limited amount each of
       us has to give. Therefore, making sure we know that our money is
       going to be used as intended is very important, because every
       dollar that goes to a scam is one that could be going to a good
       organization.
       I'd like to find a good charity to donate for cleft palate repair.
       Anyone have experience with Smile Train or another suggestion? I
       see that Smile Train isn't rated by Charity Navigator due to much
       of its donations coming in the form of services by healthcare pros.

       I fully support single-payer healthcare.
       I was thinking more internationally. We seem to have done a pretty
       good job addressing cleft palates here in the U.S., but many go
       uncorrected in other parts of the world. It's the kind of thing
       that seems like it can dramatically improve the quality of one's
       life at a fairly reasonable cost (I think it's around $200-$300).

   It's on Wall Street, but thank you for addressing single payer health
   care and health care for disabled children.

   I get overwhelming mail and phone calls for charities, I found out
   about National No Call (gov) organization, it works. How about adding
   addresses or email addresses for bunk charities. It will help me keep

       Their web site boats of performing 125,000 free surgeries a year,

       For all of Komen's failings and overhead, these groups probably
       make Komen look like a model charity.
       The top 5 worst charities average only 5.58% of contributions spent
       on direct aid. They all have great sounding names too, often
       similar to more reputable and honest charities. The 5 worst average
       5.58% of donations going to direct aid. It's just shameful.

 SMILE TRAIN ([258]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [259]88kathy

   has consistently been rated amongst the very best.  Their staff and
   directors are paid by private funding that does not eat into the
   donations they receive for cleft surgeries.  Even when I was on a very
   limited income I still made sure to donate the costs of at least one
   surgery per year.

   The New York Times called them (I am paraphrasing here) "the best
   charity going in terms of dollar spent per dollar taken in".

   If you want to make your list complete, you MUST include "Autism
   Speaks", where only 4% of the millions they take in goes to actually
   helping anyone.

   All those commercials you see on TV are LIES, in that they claim to
   speak FOR autistics, when they only speak about autistics, in the most
   pitying terms possible.  They say their goal is to eradicate autism,
   but we don't take kindly to being eradicated. And as you can see, we

       This is misleading in the sense that you are only giving them
       credit for their "direct" family services portion of their program
       dollars. I would say that 4% of an almost 60 million dollar budget
       is quite a bit of money. I would also say that the 44% of their
       budget that is spent on "research" cannot possibly be discounted as
       not "actually helping anyone". While I don't donate to or directly
       support Autism Speaks (we are involved in local organizations, and
       local chapters of other national charities), I still see the value
       in trying to gain knowledge on many areas of science related to
       Autism - early diagnosis, early intervention, neuroscience,
       treatments, and cure. I know a lot of people don't like that term,
       but my daughter will struggle greatly in her life, and many like
       her will not be able to easily communicate as well as yourself,
       even though they may some language, and others may never speak at
       all. I find it somewhat frustrating that anyone would take a hard
       stance on whether or not a "cure" is appropriate, seeing that many
       people on the spectrum (clearly not all) have a low or less than
       ideal quality of life.
       Personally, if I could offer my daughter treatment or a "cure", I
       would, if it made her life better and less stressful. She will
       otherwise spend her life fighting to communicate, struggling with
       severe anxiety, and trying to overcome compulsions and OCD
       tendencies. If she can live a happy life with all her struggles, I
       will be happy. I'm much more afraid that she won't be happy, nor be
       able to tell me what would make her truly happy, then I won't be
       happy. I would do most anything to make her happy. Could be
       a"cure". Could just be some treatment, medication, or change in
       surroundings. I will try to find that solution, and my sources for
       information span many areas of science, holistic remedies,
       therapies, friends and fellow family members involved with folks on
       the spectrum, of which many of those things require a great deal of
       research and funding to come to helpful conclusions.
       I can say that at least Autism Speaks is spending a lot of money,
       and a decent percentage of their budget, on research. Surely not
       all their research will help everyone, and some might not help
       anyone, but I don't believe that they are anywhere near the
       "worst".

       Not having a lot of money myself, I give to Operation Smile,

   Any charity using a call center to raise funds is crooked.  Most
   charities don't have adequate staff and volunteers to make tons of
   calls and don't bother to do so.

   Any charity calling you is using a third party fundraiser who keeps
   most of the money and gives a small amount to the charity. Any charity
   willing to pay so much money to a call center/fundraiser is also likely
   using the money they do raise to line their own pockets.

   Also, women don't need donations to get mammograms.  It's easy to get a
   free mammogram in this country, what's difficult is getting money to
   pay for treatment.  Don't listen to any charity who tells you they pay
   for breast cancer treatment, either.  They're lying. Breast cancer
   treatment is too expensive for any charity to afford.

     report from the American Institute of Philanthropy.

     o W. Todd Bassett is no longer National Commander of the Salvation
     Army. The current National Commander, Israel L. Gaither, is paid
     somewhere between $79,389 and $243,248 annually for his services.
     (Since the Salvation Army, as a religious organization, doesn't
     report its expenses to the IRS, the only available figures for
     executive salaries are estimates, which vary greatly from source to
     source.)

     o UNICEF's Executive Director, Anthony Lake, earns $201,351 a year,
     according to a 2010 communique from the organization -- dramatically
     less than the $1,200,000 per year claimed in the message above.

   on how much the head of a non-profit can be paid in compensation and
   still maintain it's charitable status. I would make this amount
   something like $300,000 a year.

   That would  end abuses like pastors who have private jets, college
   coaches making millions to teach "student" athletes, the of trade
   organizations making millions, and many other abuses like this. To
   close loopholes we also need a law that caps how much of the funds
   these so cal charitable fundraiser can keep (and still allow the
   charity to be tax exempt) and laws banning too close relationships
   between, fundraisers and the charities (in many cases the charities
   founders will use a fundraiser owned by a family member even a spouse).

   By keeping the focus on secular organizations while we lobby for the
   law, we could also eventually tie up a lot of these prosperity gospel
   flim-flam artist. A win win.

   By the way $300,000/yr is a lot but running a major organization like
   the Red Cross does require someone with a lot of management skills so
   that needs to be acknowledged. I guess the alternative would a
   progressive cap system based on the annual amount the charity raised,
   but I could see that getting abused, so I prefer a hard cap.

 Children's Intl Prez Jim Cook, $425 thou annually ([440]0+ / 0-)

   I sponsored an Indian kid(from the country, India)thinking the idea was
   a closer relating to the child, sorta as a big bro or sis, but the
   minimum $22 per month, per child is dumped into a general fund. I
   didn't learn this until after a year, cuz' I was donating $40 per month
   thinking it helped her a wee bit more above paying for her CI programs
   as her family(5)made only $95 month.

   The Prez/CEO of Children's Intl makes in annual salary/benefits,
   $425,000, or about $35,000 per month. I complained and a VP got back to
   me to insulate him from me, by saying Jim Cook, the CEO sponsors 19
   kids himself, per month. Turns out it's $5,000 per year for thse 19
   kids at $22 per month. I'm on disability, and I pay a higher percentage
   of my funds sponsoring Razia, than he does sponsoring 19 kids at the
   same monthly rate per kid.

   I proposed to him and the VP since his job is to advocate for $22 per
   month each for his kids for his measly $35,000 per month he should
   adjust his sponsorship to 250 kids at $50 per month for 5 years,
   decreasing his monthly take from $35,000 to around $22,000 per month. I
   got no response, ever, though I proposed it a couple of times.

   Earlier this year, Razia, my kid was graduating, so they sent me
   letters about another kid to sponsor. I wrote back, yet again oif my
   proposal for him to care for 250 kids at $50/month for 5 years, again
   no answer.
   Jim Cook over 5 years would make over $2 million, and if he sponsored
   the 250 kids as I suggested, over 5 years he gets a 'measly'over $1.3
   million. Oh, the tragedy of being a low paid CEO for a charity...kids
   charity. Kid-$22/month, CEO-$35,000/month.

   To me CI's sponsorship program is a come on marketing gimmick. The
   funds are dumped into a general fund, and I don't need them to point me
   to a kid to write letters of encouragement to. They just use the idea
   of a personal sponsorship arrangement as a hook, and after a year of
   giving Razia an extra $18 per month, I find that it was going into
   another separate general fund.

   Don't get me wrong, I liked knowing Razia was in the program, but it
   had nothing personal to do with me. She was almost 19 and about to
   graduate and I, in no way wanted to stop as her 'sponsor.' It's not her
   fault advocates for people who are poor like her, use dishonesty, and
   misrepresentation.

       accept a far more modest but still livable salary.  There is no way
       in hell that anyone needs that much money - with that salary you
       could pay off even the priciest of student loans in a few months.

       a non-profit CEO's salary has nothing to do with the functionality

   are offering our wedding guests the option of donating to a variety of

   already, not to mention a really small house that can't hold much more
   stuff. LOL. (There's a donation aggregator created just for weddings,
   the I Do Foundation, which makes it pretty simple.) I'm glad to see
   none of the charities we're considering are on this list. I use Charity
   Navigator to check out every organization before I consider donating
   even a dollar to them.

   The thing I found most disgusting about the worst charities is how many
   of them use sick/disabled children and veterans to grift money from
   people who truly want to help.

   Uncharitable 'charities' have gotten away with this for too long.

   My mother who died earlier this year was one who gave regularly to
   several that are on this list. I'm not exaggerating; every single day
   there was a solicitation in her mail from at least one of more than 30
   that hounded her by both mail and phone.

   When I took over her bill paying while she was ill I was surprised at
   how often and how much she was giving.
   I looked up every one she gave to on CharityNavigator and showed her
   how little if nothing she gave was actually helping anyone other than
   the CEO's. She got mad! Instead, we urged her to give to our local food
   bank.

   You would not believe the amount of calendars, greeting cards, notepads
   and other crap they sent her! And now, since her mail comes to my house
   I receive it all...argh!

       I hope you're not referring to the Humane Society of the United

       less than a penny of every dollar they raise.  The rest goes to

       Local shelters actually have to pay HSUS to receive materials and
       assistance from that organization, which they really cannot afford.
       Also, I wouldn't give to WWF.  They are considered one of the
       members of "Big Green."  They take a lot of corporate donations
       from industries engaged in the very practices they're supposedly
       fighting.  Big Green "environmental charities" give a greenwashing
       "seal of approval", or soften their stance on environmental
       legislation (e.g., opt to support weaker antipollution measures
       over stronger proposals), or both, in exchange for this funding.
       My choice would be the Center For Biological Diversity.  They take
       zero corporate cash.

 Love animals do you well...here is this ([515]0+ / 0-)

   Look up Oreo's Law and HSUS role in killing
   a law that would have helped so many shelter animals, in effect, HSUS
   helped to kill animals, by not getting behind the law. It was really
   about the ASPCA's killing of Oreo, a dog who was thrown out of a
   several story building by his owner. The ASPCA, PETA, American Humane
   Society, all could have helped, but instead what they did is go against
   strapped rescue groups who want to save every animal possible, and so,
   occasionally have many animals from time to time as they don't have the
   resources these big groups have. PETA, kills thousands of animals
   annually, calling it euthenasia, which has come to mean killing,..only
   it isn't actually it is mercy killing, it isn't mercy to kill a healthy
   animal. These big well-financed groups through the media call rescue
   groups hoarders. Animals are not harmed by a little bit of crowding
   temporarily, and they would not be crowded if they had the funds HSUS,
   PETA, ASPCA does. They could help these small groups, but they don't,
   but they do villify them by calling them hoarders. And many NY shelters
   won't allow animals about to be killed to be taken by a rescue group
   who is run by volunteers willing to spend time helping thse "healthy"
   animals. Oreo's Law would have helped, HSUS kept it from passing.
   FYI, Read more at the No Kill Advocacy Center website.

 HSUS and WWF ([519]0+ / 0-)

   As some other posters have noted these orgs both are very questionable,
   especially the HSUS, which currently has a RICO (federal racketeering)
   suit against it.  I'm very surprised that it's not on the list of the
   "worst of the worst."  In recent years they (HSUS) also have taken over
   a number of smaller charities, including The Fund for Animals (which
   was founded by the late author Cleveland Amory), and the International
   Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), both of which used to be relatively
   "good" orgs.  HSUS does not advertise that these charities are now part
   of their fund-raising empire but they are.

   PETA, also, as noted by someone else, is a ghastly org that probably
   directly kills more animals than it has ever helped.  I used to think
   they were innovative and clever, but the more I learned about them, the
   more sickened and horrified I became.  (Do a web search on them and
   you'll see what I'm talking about.)

   It's become clear to me that just because someone claims to want to
   help animals (or sick kids, or veterans, or whomever) that does not
   necessarily mean that they are sane, honest or humane.  It may mean
   quite the opposite, in fact.

   It would be helpful if there was a rating list specifically of
   animal-related charities that made information on them easily
   available.  I get dozens of mail solicitations from animal charities
   every month (plus all the other pleas for donations from non-animal
   progressive causes) and even though I have a fairly long history of
   involvement in animal welfare issues, I've never heard of half of these
   outfits -- who owns them, what they actually do, their relationship to
   other orgs, etc.  Does anyone know of a site where such info is
   available?  Personally I'd love to know.

   I read an article over a year ago about this thing called the "overhead
   myth." I went looking for the article but couldn't find it in among the
   static, but I did find a .org that apparently is related.   I just
   wanted to chime in to point out that if you evaluate an organization
   solely on how much it spends on admin support (which this article
   implies, but doesn't explicitly state) then you are doing it wrong.

   A good charity will have a strong administrative core and distribution
   network, and that takes money.  There's no getting around it.  It
   doesn't matter a hill of beans if an org has low overhead if they can't
   actually meet their missions statement because of poor organization.
   So yes while some, many and maybe even all of the above 50 could be
   terrible organizations, I don't know (I give to specific other ones and
   don't go charity surfing), please don't use just overhead as the
   evaluative criteria.

   My fiancee and I are in the process of starting a non-profit
   organization for Combat Veterans and their families. So far, we have
   had few donations, but most of the start-up costs have come out of
   pocket. We are still trying to get the $850.00 in order to file our
   1023 form with the IRS for 501(c)(3) tax exempt status. That way, we
   can provide each donor with documentation for deducting their donation
   from their personal or business taxes.

   Our intent for starting this NPO is to SERVE the Combat Veterans, to
   help them to heal from the silent wounds that they have received in
   battle, especially Combat Associated PTSD, and to heal the family
   members who have been affected as a direct result of those wounds.

   are on this list. There are not volunteers willing to pound the phones
   8 hours a day, so charities use telemarketers. Donated money pays the
   wages for those telephone talking people, it does not cost the charity
   a penny and they get at least 30% of all donations. What the charities
   do with that free money after that is up to them. It is not a scam at

 CharityWatch is a great arbiter ([613]2+ / 0-)

          [614]nomandates, [615]Amber6541

   I joined CharityWatch back when it was still the American Institute of
   Philanthropy because my father (a retired CPA) and I were both  getting
   inundated by donation requests based on our giving histories and it was
   getting harder to separate out the good from the bad.

   CharityWatch gives the highest level of scrutiny to organizations and
   "uncooks" the books that confuse many.  While others were lauding Greg
   Mortenson, CharityWatch was doing its homework and pulling back the
   curtain on his scam.

 Charity begins at home ([629]1+ / 0-)

          [630]Amber6541

   I have a poor relative I know deserves charity.. I also have some
   acquaintances I feel I should help. I donate directly to them, my
   largest donations.  My small donations go to St Jude's Hospital,
   campaigns for Senator Bernie Sanders, Op-Ed News, American Society for
   Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and several important political
   activist organizations.  I never donate to anyone who telephones me to
   solicit, and I am always careful not to donate to organizations I do
   not know.

   It is important to remember than Charity Begins at Home.

 Most reputable charities ([633]0+ / 0-)

   will tell you up front what percentage of donations go where.  But if
   they don't, then it's important to ask.

   There's more to determining what constitutes a "good" charity than how
   much of their donations go into their stated purpose though.  There is
   one very well known organization whose stated mission is to provide
   "meaningful work" for the disabled, but those who work there might find
   themselves earning as little as 22 cents an hour.

   I'll believe corporations are people when one comes home from
   Afghanistan in a body bag.

 These guys ([636]0+ / 0-)

     5.  Firefighters Charitable Foundation

   really do send you the tickets they sell you over the phone and I
   bought them once. I know other people who went to the concert (or
   whatever their fundraiser dujour is). The details differ from state to
   state but it's the same umbrella organization.

   I did a little research and found that 70% of their revenue goes to
   executive compensation. These guys are millionaires from what I was
   able to gather.

   I always wonder about the tear jerking country singer on the "wounded
   warrior" project ads but they're not in the top 50 list so maybe
   they're okay.

   Reaganomics noun pl: blind faith that unregulated capitalism can
   provide unlimited goods and services, that government is bad and it can
   increase revenue by decreasng revenue. Synonyms: Friedmanomics.
   Antonyms: common sense. Related Words: Laffer curve

   Amazingly, the link shows that only four of the fifty cited charities
   actually gave 10% or more to those who needed the donations.  And
   people are complaining about the IRS investigating organizations asking
   for tax-exempt status?

 How to judge a charity ([643]0+ / 0-)

   There has been a lot of discussion about the value of charities and
   it's pretty much a consensus that you DO NOT judge a charity on its low
   overhead. Using the example of the Make A Wish Foundation, they made
   $20 million for the cause.

   Would it have been better if they made a measly ten grand but had a
   small 3% overhead?

   What am I missing? What is this list missing?

   by [644]just say why on [645]Fri Aug 23, 2013 at 08:35:45 AM PDT



 It's interesting how some seem to advocate for ([646]0+ / 0-)

   overhead being by far the most important criterion for judging
   charities and others saying it shouldn't be considered at all.  I would
   say the answer lies somewhere in between.

   As benchwarmer points out, you'd certainly want the organization to
   have a solid base of operations to be able to carry out its duties.
   The trick is figuring out just how much is really necessary for
   stability, and how much is excess.  How can you tell when low overhead
   means the group is struggling to survive versus having discovered ways
   to work more efficiently and cut out waste?  On the opposite end of the
   spectrum, at what level would you place a cutoff for considering
   overhead percentage to be wasteful and excessive?  Even when doing a
   lot of digging, it might still be difficult to find a satisfying answer
   to these questions.
