   Representative Louie Gohmert (R-TX) questions U.S. Attorney General
   Eric Holder during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on
   "I'm telling you, she's a babe!"
   Republican congressman and general nutcase Louie Gohmert just doesn't
   [30]understand why we need the Employment Non-Discrimination Act
   (ENDA):

     "Who wants to go talking about sexual orientation when they're
     working? Good grief."

   Well, Louie Gohmert, for one ... from his official [31]House of
   Representatives biography:

     Today, he and his wife Kathy are the proud parents of three
     daughters.

   See how that works, Louie? Good grief. Asshole.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [49]Tagging tips - [50]Search For Tags - [51]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Straight folks forget how often this information is 'filled in' by
       default. That is why gay folks have to flaunt it, they need to get
       your attention.
       Mr Gohmert's statement is a prime example. It just is, right?

       Wiki entry excerpt:

     A coprolite is fossilized feces. Coprolites are classified as trace
     fossils as opposed to body fossils, as they give evidence for the
     animal's behaviour (in this case, diet) rather than morphology. The
     name is derived from the Greek words ko'pro*s (kopros, meaning
     'dung') and li'tho*s (lithos, meaning 'stone'). They were first
     described by William Buckland in 1829. Prior to this they were known
     as "fossil fir cones" and "bezoar stones." They serve a valuable
     purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the
     predation and diet of extinct organisms. Coprolites may range in
     size from a few millimetres to over 60 centimetres.

     Coprolites, distinct from paleofaeces, are fossilized animal dung.
     Like other fossils, coprolites have had much of their original
     composition replaced by mineral deposits such as silicates and
     calcium carbonates. Paleofaeces, on the other hand, retain much of
     their original organic composition and can be reconstituted to
     determine their original chemical properties. In the same context,
     there are the urolites, erosions caused by evacuation of liquid
     wastes and nonliquid urinary secretions.
       When someone is impatient and says, "I haven't got all day," I
       always wonder, How can that be? How can you not have all day?

   that he and his partner Kevin had three kids, that's exactly what
   Gohmert thinks shouldn't be protected by law.  That's not talking about
   mechanisms and such, but the whole point is the heteronormativity
   implicit in Gohmert's argument.  If people are talking about straight
   relationships, it doesn't come off as talking about "their sexual
   orientation," because it's the default norm, even though it is the
   case.

       It is a rare workplace, even today, where a LGBT employee can do
       something as simple as sharing their weekend plans with their loved
       ones over the lunch table.
       What a burden it must be to have to be completely aware of every
       word you utter and have to anticipate the path of a conversation,
       lest you expose yourself to ridicule, termination, violence or even
       death.
       That this is the case still, in the 21st century, is a disgrace.
       The good news is our current generation of young adults is far less
       likely to discriminate so than their preceding generations are.
       With each new generation, society improves.
       Maybe someday, we'll be able to say the same about Congress.
       Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness are not possible for all
       Americans as longs as discrimination exists, as long as there is a
       reasonable need for anyone to carry the burden of secrecy around
       his and her innate selves.
       And if any one of us isn't free, none of us are free.

   There is no connection between stating you are a proud single parent

   enough to have two parents in their lives, though, it's kinda hard to
   mention that without also mentioning who that other parent is.

   I have a very vivid imagination, and right now, it is my enemy.

   I prefer to think of Louie Gohmert doing what I usually think of him
   doing -- huntin' wabbits!

   are counterproductive.  It's time we realized that Gohmert and his ilk
   are very astute students of the public.  They are con-men who
   constantly feed the bigotry of their constituency and are rewarded with
   re-election.  This is what the idiots in that part of Texas want and
   expect from their representatives.  All we do is give him a venue to
   spread his filth.  Calling him stupid id a kindness when he is truly
   evil.

 Yep. He doesn't accept or even recognize that ([769]0+ / 0-)
       heterosexuality is a sexual orientation. Actually, he may not even
       accept the concept of sexual orientation; homophobes will often
       adopt an attitude that's close to being a parody of strict
       Skinnerian anti-mentalism and argue that attractions and desires
       and hopes and aspirations are meaningless concepts; only behavior
       counts, and only acts involving the genitals qualify as "behavior"
       (with the exception of kissing and hand-holding, the latter of
       which, particularly when two women are involved, is referred to as
       "fondling"). "Speech acts" are dealt with using the logical fallacy
       of special pleading: a boy who says a girl is "hot" isn't engaging
       in behavior, but a boy who says another boy is "hot" is.

   They don't recognize gay families as families. They don't recognize
   homosexuality as a form of love, only as a form of sex. They view it on
   par with a scandalous affair or hiring a prostitute or having a taboo
   fetish - something to hide and be ashamed of (not that I think
   prostitution or fetishes are shameful, but they do). And they're blind
   to the idea that two men or two women can live together and have the
   exact same loving relationship and family life that a man and a woman
   can.
