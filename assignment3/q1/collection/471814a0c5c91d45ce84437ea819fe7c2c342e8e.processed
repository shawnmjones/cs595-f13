   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: The family will not bring Tamerlan's body back to Russia,
       spokeswoman said
     * Source: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev says plans changed days before bombing
     * Body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev has been claimed by family
     * Brothers considered a suicide attack on July 4, source tells CNN

   (CNN) -- The bombs used in the Boston Marathon attack were built in the
   apartment that suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev shared with his wife and
   child, a U.S. law enforcement official with first-hand knowledge of the
   investigation told CNN on Thursday. The official was not authorized to
   release the information.

   Katherine Russell, Tsarnaev's widow, [49]has remained largely out of
   view inside her parents' North Kingstown home since her husband's
   death.

   It remains unclear what, if anything, Tamerlan's widow might have known
   or suspected, the source added.

   According to her attorney, Amato DeLuca, the 24-year-old widow knew
   nothing of plans to bomb the race, and reports of her husband's
   involvement came as an "absolute shock" to Russell and her family.

   Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, initially planned to carry
   out a suicide-bomb attack on July 4, a U.S. law enforcement official
   regularly briefed on the Boston bombing investigation told CNN. The
   source said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators their bombs were ready
   earlier than they expected and they decided to move up the date.

   Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators that the Boston Marathon was
   chosen as a target only a day or two before the event, the source said.
   Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body claimed
   Tsarnaev's friends are 'social animals'
   Suspect's visa should have been revoked
   Trying to heal after Boston bombings

   It is unclear which specific event would have been targeted but one of
   the biggest July Fourth celebrations in the country is held in Boston.
   The annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular hosts 500,000 spectators,
   according to the event's website. It is televised live nationally on
   CBS.

   The revelation comes the same day the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev was
   claimed by his family and later was picked up by a funeral home,
   according to Terrel Harris, spokesman for the Massachusetts office of
   the chief medical examiner.

   Harris declined to say which funeral home picked it up.

   Tsarnaev's cause of death will not be released until the death
   certificate is filed with the Boston city clerk, he said. The earliest
   that's expected to happen is Friday morning, Harris said.

   His parents in Dagestan will not bring the bombing suspect's body back
   to Russia and will not bury him until an "independent" autopsy is
   conducted, family spokeswoman Kheda Saratova said Friday.

   His body will be interred "somewhere in Boston," she said.

   One item that may yield some clues into the bombings case is now in the
   hands of federal officials.

   The FBI has a laptop belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Tamerlan's younger
   brother, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN.

   The computer was turned over to investigators by one of his friends
   accused of obstructing justice.

   A lawyer for Dias Kadyrbayev tells CNN that his client "turned over the
   laptop to the FBI." He didn't say when the laptop was turned over.

   A law enforcement source confirmed the attorney's account.

   Three people died and more than 260 were wounded when two explosive
   devices fashioned from pressure cookers and other materials exploded in
   separate locations near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April
   15.

   Four people have been charged in connection with the bombing, including
   Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of carrying out the attack along with
   his brother, Tamerlan, 26. The older brother died April 19 after a
   firefight with police, hours after authorities released images of the
   suspected bombers.

   Azamat Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev were charged Wednesday with conspiring
   to discard potentially incriminating items from Dzhokhar's dorm room,
   including empty fireworks containers, while Robel Phillipos was charged
   with making false statements to investigators.

   The Kazakhstan Foreign Ministry said Thursday it was offering consular
   services to Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, who are citizens of that country
   and are in the United States on student visas.

   "We would like to emphasize that our citizens did not receive charges
   of involvement in the organization of the Boston Marathon bombings.
   They were charged with destroying evidence," the ministry said in a
   statement.

   Dzhokhar, who suffered gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and
   hands, is being held at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility in
   Devens, Massachusetts. He has been charged with using a weapon of mass
   destruction and could face the death penalty if convicted.

   Authorities have said they believe the brothers acted alone, but are
   investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by
   terror groups, including groups overseas.

   Of particular interest has been Tamerlan Tsarnaev's 2012 trip to the
   semi-autonomous Russian republic of Dagestan, home to numerous Islamic
   militant groups that have warred against Moscow's rule.

   Russian authorities asked U.S. officials to investigate Tamerlan some
   months before the trip, saying they believed he was becoming
   increasingly involved with radical Islam. The FBI investigated, but
   found no evidence of extremist activity and closed the case.

   U.S. officials learned after the bombings that Russian officials had
   intercepted a 2011 phone call between the suspect's mother, living in
   Dagestan, and one of her sons in which they reportedly had a vague
   conversation about jihad, a law enforcement official told CNN earlier.

   Some lawmakers, particularly Republicans, have been critical of how law
   enforcement officials, intelligence agencies and the administration of
   President Barack Obama handled the Russian tip.

   While Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother were added to a terror database
   following the FBI investigation, Tamerlan was allowed to make his
   Russian trip in 2012 and return six months later.

   CNN's Susan Candiotti and Marina Carver contributed to this report.
