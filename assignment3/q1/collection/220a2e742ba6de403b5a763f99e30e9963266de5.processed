[44]Morgan Spurlock on 'Inside Man': 'Each week I get to be immersed into a
different world'

   Tonight at 10 p.m., watch the premiere of the [45]CNN Original series
   "Inside Man," hosted and produced by documentary filmmaker Morgan
   Spurlock, which profiles the medical marijuana industry.

   CNN: It sounds like what makes "Inside Man" different from other shows
   is the fact that you truly and fully performed eight different jobs.
   Can you tell me a little bit about what each of those jobs entailed?

   Morgan Spurlock: The best part of "Inside Man" is that each week I get
   to be immersed into a different world. I'm neck-deep in an experiential
   story that takes me to the front lines of some of the most debated
   issues in the country today: marijuana, guns, immigration, education,
   elder care, unions, bankrupt cities and the worst drought in U.S.
   history.

   For marijuana, I worked in the [46]largest dispensary in the United
   States, Harborside Medical in Oakland, California. It's a non-profit
   cooperative that sells more than $25 million worth of marijuana and
   cannabis products per year. It's pretty incredible, and in the episode,
   I become your weed connoisseur.

   After that, I head to Fredericksburg, Virginia, and work alongside the
   good folks at SSG Tactical, one of Virginia's most reliable and success
   gun retailers. While there, I sell firearms to the well-armed masses
   while we try to understand what drives America's gun culture.

   The next week, I make my way to Florida to pick oranges alongside a few
   of the millions of country's immigrant laborers. While Washington
   debates what to do with the huddled masses, I attempt to understand
   what brings them here and why they risk so much to be part of the
   fabric of America.

   Week 4 is all about education, and I follow in my mom's footsteps,
   becoming a teacher in both Finland, which has the most successful
   education program in the world, and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which for
   years has not had the most respected pedigree when it comes to
   preparing our kids for the future. But things are changing, and schools
   are now taking greater risks to achieve greater rewards.

   Probably my favorite episode of the season is Week 5, where we look at
   the world of elder care and end-of-life issues. I go back home to West
   Virginia and move in with my 91-year-old grandmother, Tootie. She still
   lives on her own and is still a pistol, but once you reach that age,
   health problems abound, and if you don't prepare for them early enough,
   you have much bigger problems down the road.

   Week 6 looks at the largest bankrupt city in America, Stockton,
   California. Most of us have no idea what would ever cause a city to
   declare bankruptcy, let alone what it takes to get out of it. While
   here, I talk to the folks who it's affecting the most: the citizens of
   Stockton, who, since the city filed for bankruptcy, have seen their
   police and fire departments downsized while crime and mortgage defaults
   escalate.

   Did you know that 2012 was one of the worst droughts in U.S. history?
   Did you know that 2013 is predicted to be even worse? Well, unless
   you're one of the thousands of farmers or ranchers living in the
   heartland, you probably didn't, but you also probably didn't realize
   that it affects even you. In this episode, I move in with the Wellnitz
   family in Chadron, Nebraska. They've been ranching for years, but this
   could be one of their hardest years yet.

   Our final episode in the series looks at unions in America. They were
   the backbone of the middle class for decades, but with the majority of
   manufacturing jobs now overseas, have the outstayed their welcome? I
   speak to the people are still fighting for their unions, as well as
   those who say it's time for the free market to take over.

   CNN: Name one thing about each industry you were embedded in that
   Americans would be surprised to learn.

   MS: At the dispensary, I was surprised to see how many people came in
   [47]who were legitimately sick.

   - In the gun store, it was interesting to see how much fear drove
   purchases for most of the clientele.

   - While picking oranges in Florida, I was blown away to learn how few
   American-born pickers actually exist - almost none.

   - In the education episode, I couldn't believe how far behind we still
   are in America when it comes to educating our kids.

   - While living with my grandmother in the elder-care episode, I was
   speechless when I learned how much it costs to go to a retirement home.
   Many of them are well over $6,000/month.

   - In Stockton, America's largest bankrupt city, I couldn't believe how
   there were no ramifications for cities that make poor investment
   choices.

   - While ranching in the drought episode, I was deeply moved by the
   passion and conviction of the Wellnitz family. To me, they are the core
   of what it means to be an American.

   - In the union episode, it was fascinating to see that unions recognize
   how many mistakes they've made over the years.

   CNN: I understand that [48]at the marijuana dispensary, you were
   gobsmacked by the various forms of marijuana. Can you tell me about the
   different choices, maybe set the scene?

   MS: First off, it's beautiful there. It's better designed and prettier
   than many traditional health clinics I've been in. And on the shelves,
   Holy Toledo, are there a lot of choices! They had everything from jars
   of weed, to pre-rolled joints, to hash, to creams and salves,
   tinctures, lozenges, cookies, cakes, candy bars, drinks, you name it.
   If you can eat it, someone somewhere can put medical marijuana in it. I
   couldn't believe it.

   CNN: What is your favorite product from the marijuana dispensary?

   MS: They had marijuana tabs, like those Listerine breath strips you can
   buy. Pretty crazy.

   CNN: The elder care episode was especially personal for you because you
   were [49]caretaker for your own grandmother. Was it hard to balance the
   many day-in, day-out job requirements with your personal feelings about
   your grandmother?

   MS: I love my grandmother. Would do anything for her. So for me, it was
   always much more about making sure she was happy and had everything she
   needed. When I was growing up, she was always so wonderful to me; I
   feel like it's our responsibility to take care of our elders, but it
   just seems like society and our busy lives have made it too easy to
   lock the elderly away and justify it with a variety of excuses. I hope
   my kids will do the same for me, but in reality, they'll probably just
   put me out to pasture like an old horse.

   CNN: What did you learn from your grandmother that you never would have
   found out had you not had the privilege of being her caretaker?

   MS: I would not have heard so many intimate stories about her and my
   grandfather, how they fell in love, what life meant to her, and why she
   lived such a full and wonderful life.

       The education show was of great interest to me since I am a
       teacher. Teaching the Finland way does work in the United States. I
       teach their way in an alternative high school in which most of my
       kids are poor and have a long history of school failure.In a short
       period of time I am able to take most kids from being math failures
       to successfully doing beginning college level work. I abhor the
       regimentation of the charter school which appears to turn their
       kids into mindless robots.

       The gun show was so naive and scary. The debate was over before it
       started. There are going to be no new gun laws and we are going to
       keep on killing each other and then lament how can this be. Nathan
       Independent you want research. It already exists. The research
       shows that the more guns that are present the more likely that they
       will be used. The research shows that those guns that people have
       in their homes for protection are far, far, far, far more likely to
       be used on someone you know in an innocent situation like believing
       you shoot someone who is a burgler who turns out to be a member of
       the family. The research shows that contries that have tough gun
       control laws have virtually no gun homicides compared to the United
       States. You want common sense. Virtually all the research says we
       would be safer with tougher gun control laws. Gun advocates playing
       on and creating fears where no danger exists are making the United
       States a more dangerous place.

       this show has great potential but so far is a kind of watered down
       version of 30 days. i really don't care about the city of stockton
       either-can we get a show on some random small audience issues? the
       shut down of US online poker and STEALING of US CITIZEN'S money by
       the US government. and GMOs-if they are so safe, why can't we label
       them? or not that they would ever allow it, but go work inside a
       factory farm or meat processing plant. what if every town had
       community gardens that grew food for homeless people? what if
       instead of lawns everyone had a veggie garden? i know my ideas lean
       pretty liberal, but hey, it is cnn, not fox.

       Suggestion: Do a show entitled "What if the only ammunition
       available to the general public was Non-Lethal Ammo?" Passing such
       a law would not effect the grossly misinterpreted 2nd Amendment,
       but the best feature is that it would make all other gun control
       laws obsolete. Do you have the guts?...rick

       I've watched every show/ documentary Morgan has ever done. He is an
       excellent journalist. I loved the 30 days episode about living in
       poverty. It was really truthful. I really like the Inside Man shows
       so far. Keep up the good work. I'm watching.

       Oh and by the way, alot of focus on large capacity magazines used
       in the very rare mass shootings, but NO mention of the facts around
       shootings that are stopped and cut short by armed citizens. Do some
       research on the average number of victims when police stop a
       shooting vs. the number when a citizen (conceal carry-CCW) stops an
       active shooter. When seconds count, LEO are minutes away. Also NO
       mention of the fact that the cities with the highest shooting
       violence rates are those with the most restrictive gun laws.
       Chicago = forced victims. Common sense folks.

       How about looking at the sports world, with an emphasis on
       football, and the use of all drugs. The PED's or banned drugs can
       speed recovery or "enhance" performance. The legal drugs don't get
       talked about much and some players might not be able to suit up
       without them and yet they are not considered performance enhancers.
       I remember a line from a Nick Nolte movie about pro football. His
       character had been caught using marijuana and his comment was
       something like "Hell, you guys give me a whole lot worse just to
       get me on the field on Sunday."

       100% Service-Connected, disabled veteran (You're welcome for my
       service, but it wasn't my idea.)
       Besides PTSD, anxiety disorders, I have Type 2 Diabetes related
       neuropathy, arthritis pain, sleep issues. Marijuana would work to
       relieve much of this, and I qualify for a Medical Marijuana card in
       this state. Despite assurances by the state that card-holder
       information is closely guarded and absolutely confidential, I'm
       hesitant to obtain one because all my income, my mortgage payments,
       my medical care, benefits, etc. derives from the Federal Vets
       Admin.
       I fear loss of benefits if the Feds decide to crack down on
       something the states have overwhelmingly approved.
       Obama promised in 2008 election speeches that he would not expend
       law enforcement resources on marijuana distribution approved by the
       states - Then he's reneged on this promise (Never mind Gitmo, the
       wars funding, and surveillance).
       Nixon put marijuana into Controlled Substances Act, Schedule I
       Class as part of his "war on dissidents" - Nixon was/is a crook!
       Marijuana doesn't meet Schedule I Class criteria:
       "Potential for abuse." - Hell! Chocolate and bacon have potential
       for abuse!
       "No recognized medical utility. - Not true! But Feds won't allow
       research, so lots of medical applications cannot be considered.
       "Not considered safe under medical supervision." - No one has ever
       died from using marijuana. Can't say that about a lot of medically
       approved prescription meds.
       Govt. hypocrisy is funded by alcohol, private prison and Big Pharma
       lobbies. Obama used to smoke the stuff, but now he's in the pocket
       of the lobbyists and the other crooks in Wash. DC. "Absolute power
       absolutely corrupts."
       The American People need to make this a state's rights issue.

       After seeing the promos for weeks about this episode I feared that
       Morgan was going to present this subject with a negative bent
       against medical marijuana in California. Tonight I was pleasantly
       surprised that the episode was just the opposite and showcased a
       model of medical marijuana done correctly, lawfully and
       professionally. Thank you also for bringing to the forefront the
       hypocrisy of the federal government and how the deep-pocket
       lobbying of big pharma and alcohol are buying our government to
       unfairly prosecute these citizen-voted, legal dispensaries. As a
       chronic pain sufferer living in Illinois, a state which has just
       recently voted to legalize medical marijuana, I fear that the same
       may happen here before the program begins and that instead of
       finally finding true relief from my disease, I will be forced to
       continue to take a handful of pills that offer marginal help, yet
       plague me with a plethora of horrible physical side-effects. It is
       about time for the federal government listen to the will of the
       people as is dictated by the constitution!
       I also urge Morgan to investigate the new life-changing phenomena
       of electronic cigarettes. These devices just may be the answer to
       stop tobacco smoking in this country, thus reducing death and
       disease. But here again the deep pockets of big pharma, and in this
       case, the tobacco manufacturers are buying the law-making powers of
       the FDA to regulate these devices in a manner that will either make
       the large pharmaceutical companies a lot of money with their
       ineffective nicotine replacement therapies (the pills, patches and
       gum) or may end up keeping a percentage of our population smoking
       tobacco cigarettes for the foreseeable future. These proposed laws
       against electronic cigarettes are nothing more than ways to keep
       cash flowing to big tobacco and "sin" tax dollars flowing to
       government while ultimately keeping anti-smoking groups employed
       for decades to come.
       In fact, it's quite shocking to me just how similar both medical
       marijuana and electronic cigarettes have become the targets of the
       federal government. And if something does not change soon the
       citizens of this country will lose their options for good health
       over unscientific ideology and the Almighty Dollar!
