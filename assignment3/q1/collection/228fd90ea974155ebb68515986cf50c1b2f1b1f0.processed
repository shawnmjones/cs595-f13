   CPAC banner with dinosaurs and the goposaur
   CPAC 2013 convention hall, mostly empty
   I am, finally, back from CPAC, the Conservative Political Action
   Conference, aka the Blunderdome, aka PullUpTheLadderPalooza, aka The
   Great White Mope, aka The Place That Still Likes Sarah Palin. I am
   coherent and all of my limbs are still attached, so I consider it a
   fine success, even if a little piece of my soul died during the last
   day. That was when they put many of the most hard-hard-right speakers,
   who rose to the occasion with verbal cannons filled with the reddest of
   meat and not much else.

   If nothing else, CPAC is a good opportunity to see what the most
   hard-core of conservatives are thinking, in handy bulk form. The
   conference is for the hard-right base, and is conservative first and
   foremost and "Republican" only as a distant second. Most of the
   audience and nearly every speaker not currently planning on running for
   something has harsh words for the party, and gets ample applause from
   the audience for those harsh words. The loyalty to the GOP here is
   incidental, not causal; the preponderance of big GOP names here is
   because the conference has a distinct starf*cker quality to it, and all
   the big conservative stars are, of necessity, Republicans.

   This was the first CPAC I have personally gone to. I sat in the panels,
   and chatted very politely with the other attendees, and listened to
   agonizingly silly things being tossed around as gospel truth by various
   vendors. I have no doubt there are some good people speaking and
   attending. There are also a few sneering bigots, more than a few
   batshit insane conspiracy theorists, a good chunk of bona-fide
   theocrats, and a vast swath of very respectable people who might not
   believe any of that stuff, fully, but would be willing to embrace all
   of it at once if it meant success at getting their own two cents of
   agenda in there as well. A heaping helping of post-convention thoughts
   await you below the fold:

   On Thursday things looked good, or even outright dull: The first sight
   on Thursday morning is of a sea of people capped by a liberal foam of
   very young men in near-identical black suits, and much of the
   discussion centers around their own postmortems of the last rotten
   election and why this-or-that group does not like Republicans. There is
   no consensus, and while the problems of demographic suicide and other
   issues are understood intellectually, the prescriptions are universally
   shallow tweaks . By Friday, the aura of forced intellectuality begins
   to creak as it becomes clear that every last bleeding panel will
   consist of dire warnings against the obviously insane liberals who hate
   America and who supposedly want an unending stream of cartoon-villian
   level things; by the late afternoon, after incessant talk about
   Iran-bombing and freedom-loving and severe, slashing budget-cutting
   that obviously would never touch any of the things anyone ever liked
   about government, like the bombing parts, and after a panel on how not
   to be called a racist gets hijacked by an outright white nationalist,
   it is clear that a foul undercurrent of wacko cuts through the whole
   thing.

   And on Saturday, all that effort at soul-searching and message-tweaking
   and minority-courting gets beaten with a sack of bricks and left on a
   curb somewhere, and we close things off with all the craziest people
   who ever uttered a conspiracy theory about anything: Bachmann and Steve
   King, and Ann Coulter, and a Breitbart panel explicitly highlighting
   all the loons and bigots that even the official conference couldn't
   stomach, and Sarah Palin, who gets more revered the less she does, and
   Ted Cruz, patron saint of bizarre McCarthyism, U.N. conspiracy
   theories, the invisible dangers of imminent sharia law, and anything
   else that anyone might ever toss into his cavernous head.

   The two stars of the conference were, undoubtably, Rand Paul and Sarah
   Palin. Rand Paul for the recent filibuster, which finally seems to have
   cemented conservative heads around the post-Bush notion that maybe
   presidential power should not be absolute after all, and welcome to the
   party on that one. Sarah Palin, who has done nothing of note for four
   years, remains just as much a crowd hero as ever. I have no doubt
   whatsoever that the Big Gulp she used as prop in her speech will appear
   on eBay within the week, if it hasn't already. (Note for the
   authenticity record: When Palin produced the drink from below the
   podium, it was perhaps around 70 percent full; when the emcee produced
   the cup again, saying he had found it abandoned backstage, it was still
   70% full, so apparently Sarah Palin had no intention of finishing off
   her rebellious drink. Individual teaspoon-sized portions of the
   remaining soda will be placed in glass vials and available for purchase
   as relics in the lobby; payment shall be in silver or gold coinage
   only, please.)

   The Bloomberg soda ban was a very popular topic throughout the weekend,
   and repeatedly cited as evidence of all the petty, ridiculous things
   The Liberals wanted to do to the nation. The White House tours being
   cut due to sequestration were also a prime and commonplace indignation,
   an obviously mean and manipulative move by the White House to insult
   people, while few other sequester effects were noted at all. Abolishing
   the Department of Education was a another never-fail applause line.
   Sen. Ted Cruz, whose closing speech was greeted as almost an
   afterthought after the tour de force appearance of Sarah Proud and
   Tall, got his most enthusiastic applause of the entire speech
   (including a full-room standing ovation) for his demand that the
   department get axed. This is apparently one of the dominant drives of
   the conservative movement, and like other things that go without
   saying, explaining exactly what was so all-fired offensive about it
   always went without saying.

   If the crowd was any indication, you can expect a certain Dr. Ben
   Carson to be a rising star in the conservative movement. Note, however,
   that who this crowd likes does not necessarily translate to overall
   Republican success, and vice-versa. Conference audiences were dominated
   by young libertarians, who as one might expect had no particular
   fondness for social conservative obsession with gay marriage and the
   like. The tea partiers were the other dominant factor, and those people
   were the craziest, and the dumbest, and the most conspiratorial-minded.
   The theocrats (and there seemed to be a strong overlap here with the
   tea partiers) had a solid presence, headed by Rick Santorum's group
   Patriot Voices, and were generally the most belligerently insistent on
   spouting false facts. They are "faith based," which, translated,
   apparently means that if you yell loud enough you can just go with
   whatever claims you want--reality is for scientists, atheists and other
   people going to Hell.

   It's not even that the Republican Party has devolved into a bunch of
   John Birchers; there's multiple groups competing even to be the proper
   John Birthers, most of the base has gone so far off the rails. William
   F. Buckley wouldn't want anything to do with most of these nuts.

   As for the crowds? On Thursday it looked like a sea of professionals. A
   vast number of Young Conservative types dressed for church or for job
   interviews. Policy discussions are rare; each group is about
   networking. This is, after all a trade show about selling conservatism
   (or, rather, the various sub-sub-offshoots of it, since most of these
   groups are in direct or indirect competition with each other. Everyone
   is here to see and meet everyone else who is here, and typical hallway
   conversations are the usual how are you, what are you doing banter. Oh,
   you're working there now? That's great, I should introduce you to
   SoAndSo. Yes, I can make Bob SuchAndSuch available for an interview.
   That Thursday seemed so dominated by the young men in suits makes a bit
   more sense when you learn, from the day's first welcoming
   announcements, that 250+ students were bussed in from Michigan and Ohio
   for the event. The Friday and Saturday audiences include many more
   apparent day trippers, in more casual clothes and not as uniformly,
   Children-of-the-Corningly of the "ambitious Congressional page"
   demographic. This is especially true on Saturday, with the big-name,
   total-red-meat speaker lineup (there are very few panels on Saturday,
   compared to the other two days; if you're going on Saturday you're
   going to see the big speeches and the big speeches alone.)

   The Tea Party Patriots and other tea partiers have the slickest
   convention presence. Makes sense, since their fundraising goes for
   funding themselves. The NRA is less slick, and the Republican Party
   official presence exists primarily as roving bands of young volunteers
   clustered here and there, handing things out or welcoming you to the
   large but sparsely populated GOP-sponsored lounge, a wide area of
   matching couches, chairs and beanbag chairs in a far corner of the
   exhibition floor. Citizens United is omnipresent sponsors of panels,
   speakers, etc.

   This is Conservatism, Inc. It is the think tank and astroturf mechanism
   of the movement, the professional conservatives who either spend their
   lives being professionally conservative or are looking for a gig at
   just that. The recent scandal over conservative editorialists taking
   pay to write columns praising the government of Malaysia does not
   entirely surprise me; we just had a conference panel on the environment
   staffed almost entirely by members of the Heritage Foundation, and
   isn't that close to the same thing?

   A last thought: the current conservative schism seems, if anything,
   underestimated. It is a split between young and old (not good, for a
   group already losing badly among young voters) and between corporate
   (e.g. "fiscal libertarian") conservatives, who care only about fiscal
   things, and "tea party" conservatives who care about taxes and a
   further litany of very crazy things quite often rooted in extreme
   conspiracy theories. It's the tea partiers who are the most nuts. It's
   a split between young libertarians and older, much louder theocrats;
   the theocrats have the upper hand now, but the young libertarians have
   the advantage of more decades in them.

   The problem presented by that is the very one we see in the House, even
   now: the policies that the crazy base demands are not policies that are
   conducive to effective, or competent, or even barely functional
   government, and the crazy base won't accept anything else as an answer.
   That the only polices the party can elucidate are on cutting taxes and
   very, very generic demands to cut spending is no accident; on
   everything else, from foreign policy to "entitlement" programs to
   social issues, even the staunchest of conservative base has no coherent
   single policy to offer.

   The only way to keep this fragile coalition of libertarians,
   corporatists, ambitious political realists and fundamentalist
   godbotherers together on a national level is to say and do absolutely
   nothing that would piss any of the groups off. As the groups diverge
   from each other, the task gets harder--so tax cuts it is.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [44]Civil
   Rights, [45]Community, [46]Congress, [47]Culture, [48]Economy,
   [49]Education, [50]Elections, [51]Energy, [52]Environment, [53]Health
   Care, [54]International, [55]Labor, [56]Law, [57]Media, [58]Meta,
   [59]National Security, [60]Science, [61]Transportation, or [62]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([63]California, [64]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     Thanks for you work, Hunter .... I was hoping that you'd issue a
   recap. Of course .... given that you wrote of the latecomers on Fri/Sat
   due to hangovers from the partying .... I was hoping that you could
   give a synopsis of the parties.

     Or ... did you observe any of the [332]sexual debauchery that Erick
   Ericson and Dr. Melissa Clouthier fulminated about last year?

   It's the same Republican Party it's always been, a coalition of
   fiscally concerned individuals, religious rights, libertarians and the
   utter loony. Except now they don't have anyone that can unify them, and
   that I attribute to the rise of fear mongering media among them and a
   vast number of personal interests among the Republican talking heads
   more concerned about personal financial success than party success.

   As such, those media heads are geniuses. They don't really care about
   whether the party succeeds, because they're first concerned with their
   pocketbooks.

   There are elements of the Republican party I can respect. The fiscally
   conservative, the libertarians, at least I can have conversations with
   them and even agree with the libertarians on a few points.

   The Religious Right scare me, as a Christian. I don't know why there's
   this obsession with legislating religious beliefs. That tells me
   there's a lack of belief in one's beliefs. And the Tea Party, I don't
   even know where to start. The racism and homophobia are probably good
   places though.

       It's like any of the restaurant makeover shows. Most of the owners

       Since it's in DC every year, it gets all the politicians, many of
       whom only have to go across town to get there; ditto for the DC
       media. And the people in charge of it are very, very connected,
       which doesn't hurt.
       The empty chairs are somewhat misleading. Almost all the chairs
       were filled for the keynote speeches, and was about half filled or
       less for everything else. The large room size was specifically to
       accommodate the very biggest speakers (e.g. Paul, Palin).

   I honor your sacrifice.

   Actually, as an atheist, I harbor no  superstitions about the human
   soul.  I hold the idea of it in no greater and no lesser regard than
   the soul of any organism, from bacterium to sperm whale and the endless
   viral versions of life. Nevertheless, I appreciate the sentiment
   expressed in your depiction of the personal cost you have suffered by
   placing yourself at large among such people as CPAC attendees.
   Moreover, I double plus plus appreciate your dispatches from the very
   bowels of modern conservatism as expressed at CPAC. By your sacrifice,
   I was spared both having to attend myself and having to pay attention
   to any other source of information about the event other than your
   descriptions and lamentations. Thank you, Hunter, for your service.

   Also, I totally adore long, complicated sentences.

   The big money folks that fund the Republican candidates continues to

   raisers. They don't want to run for office themselves, and CPAC is
   beneath them. You guys are overpaying for a seriously inferior product.

   In reality, the clown show that was on full display at CPAC, is beneath

   Oh really? Buckley gave these people their false veneer of

   Stop propping up Buckley. He helped construct this monster.

       If you read The American Conservative that Buckley contributed to,
       I believe, you will see that they are not all that nuts.
       When Bush was in office the TAC magazine was very critical of him
       on Iraq and many other things.
       Imagine if you can what a real conservative would be like,  you get
       closer to what Buckley was like. I still didn't agree with him on
       all things but he wasn't nuts.
       His son doesn't hang with these guys either. I believe he voted for
       Obama.
       The idea people have been replace by ideology people in the
       Conservative party. Libertarians are not conservative.
       They are closer to being radical or reactionaries.
