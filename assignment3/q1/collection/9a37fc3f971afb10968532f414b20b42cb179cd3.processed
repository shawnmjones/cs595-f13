       more on the need for hard data on gun incidents, and viewing gun
       policy as a public health issue. Friday's #GunFAIL day, and today's
       news brought up an interesting point about the enormous costs
       associated with recovery from wounds. In other news: Sen. Rob
       Portman (R-OH) flips on marriage equality after revealing his own
       son is gay. And in not-exactly-news: the Popes Benedict were a
       weird bunch, historically speaking. Lastly, we finish up discussing
       Mother Jones's "All Work and No Pay."

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [50]Tagging tips - [51]Search For Tags - [52]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     Dem Senator Promotes Unsubstantiated Claim That Iran Is Enriching
     Weapons-Grade Uranium

     Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) told constituents in a letter thanking
     them for supporting diplomacy between the United States and Iran
     that the Islamic Republic -- contrary to available evidence -- is
     enriching weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear weapon and that
     unnamed "experts" have confirmed it.

     "Thank you for contacting me to express your support for diplomacy
     between the United States and Iran," the letter dated March 12, 2013
     and signed by Schumer begins, adding, "I share your concern over the
     United States' relationship with Iran and I am committed to
     supporting President Obama in advancing his diplomatic outreach."
     But the letter later makes unsubstantiated claims about Iran's
     nuclear program:

         In the past decade, Iran has developed nuclear technologies
     which U.S. and other nations' intelligence agencies believe are
     intended to produce nuclear weapons. In November of 2007, the
     Administration released a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE)
     giving evidence that Iran had operated a clandestine nuclear-weapons
     program until 2003. The nation continues to enrich uranium into
     weapons-grade nuclear materials in violation of United Nations
     resolutions, and in November of 2009 disclosed that it has a
     partially constructed enrichment facility near Qom. Although
     President Ahmadinejad maintains that these facilities are designed
     to generate civilian nuclear energy, experts say that the type of
     fuel that they produce is sufficient to arm a nuclear warhead.

     It's unclear what experts Schumer or his staff are referring to, but
     the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic
     Energy Agency, has said that Iran has thus far only enriched uranium
     up to 20 percent purity, mainly for purpose of medical research.
     "Weapons-grade" nuclear material is uranium that is enriched to 90
     percent. While the IAEA and U.S. and Israeli intelligence believe
     the Iranians have not yet made the decision to go that far, U.S.
     officials have said they think Iran is keeping its options open.
     Indeed, as Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, "I
     think they're keeping themselves in a position to make that
     decision." (Schumer's office has not responded to inquires about the
     letter before publication of this story.)

   Violence Plan.
