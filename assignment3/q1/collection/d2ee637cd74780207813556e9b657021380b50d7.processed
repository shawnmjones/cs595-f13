   We're accustomed to President Obama delivering big political speeches,
   and thinking about them in political terms -- was the rhetoric
   persuasive, will various constituencies approve or disapprove, how will
   the arguments be received, etc. But some speeches are important for
   reasons that have nothing to do with politics and everything to do with
   policy.

   President Obama's speech on national security this afternoon, delivered
   at the National Defense University, clearly falls into this latter
   category. This wasn't about inspirational oratory; this was a war-time
   president charting a new, more constructive course when it comes
   combating terrorism.

   Indeed, it was arguably a key moment in marking a possible end of the
   9/11 era. [Update: Transcript [4]here.]

   It's a little tough to summarize, largely because the president covered
   so much ground, and for detailed analysis, I'd strongly encourage you
   to tune in to tonight's The Rachel Maddow Show. But for now, let's talk
   a bit about Obama's approach to national security going forward.

     "[M]ake no mistake: our nation is still threatened by terrorists.
     From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that
     truth. We must recognize, however, that the threat has shifted and
     evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11."

   This isn't what the right wants to hear, of course, but it's very much
   in line with the assessments of nearly all credible experts on
   counter-terrorism. The nature of the threat has changed, and a
   responsible U.S. policy must change with it. That the president
   realizes this is a low bar to clear, but it's nevertheless encouraging.

     "America is at a crossroads. We must define the nature and scope of
     this struggle, or else it will define us, mindful of James Madison's
     warning that 'No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of
     continual warfare.' Neither I, nor any President, can promise the
     total defeat of terror. We will never erase the evil that lies in
     the hearts of some human beings, nor stamp out every danger to our
     open society. What we can do -- what we must do -- is dismantle
     networks that pose a direct danger, and make it less likely for new
     groups to gain a foothold, all while maintaining the freedoms and
     ideals that we defend. To define that strategy, we must make
     decisions based not on fear, but hard-earned wisdom."

   Right. The "total defeat" of a possible terrorist threat, now and
   forever, is not going to happen, and basing a national foreign policy
   on such a goal is counter-productive.

     "[W]e must define our effort not as a boundless 'global war on
     terror' -- but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to
     dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten
     America."

   It's a genuine relief to hear a president say this out loud.
     __________________________________________________________________

     "[A]s our fight enters a new phase, America's legitimate claim of
     self-defense cannot be the end of the discussion. To say a military
     tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or
     moral in every instance. For the same human progress that gives us
     the technology to strike half a world away also demands the
     discipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it. That's
     why, over the last four years, my Administration has worked
     vigorously to establish a framework that governs our use of force
     against terrorists -- insisting upon clear guidelines, oversight and
     accountability that is now codified in Presidential Policy Guidance
     that I signed yesterday."

   All of this was in reference to drone strikes, and while I'm glad the
   policy has been codified, it's worth emphasizing that this policy was
   signed "yesterday." That said, Obama went on to explain the fact that
   the "need for unmanned strikes" will "reduce" once the war in
   Afghanistan ends, that the U.S. "does not take strikes when we have the
   ability to capture individual terrorists," and that Congress "is
   briefed on every strike that America takes."

   And what of the civilian deaths? "For me, and those in my chain of
   command, these deaths will haunt us as long as we live, just as we are
   haunted by the civilian casualties that have occurred through
   conventional fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq."

   As for the Stand with Rand crowd, the president added, "For the record,
   I do not believe it would be constitutional for the government to
   target and kill any U.S. citizen -- with a drone, or a shotgun --
   without due process. Nor should any President deploy armed drones over
   U.S. soil."

     "I believe, however, that the use of force must be seen as part of a
     larger discussion about a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy.
     Because for all the focus on the use of force, force alone cannot
     make us safe. We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology
     takes root; and in the absence of a strategy that reduces the
     well-spring of extremism, a perpetual war -- through drones or
     Special Forces or troop deployments -- will prove self-defeating,
     and alter our country in troubling ways."

   In this context, it was especially heartening to hear the president
   tout the benefits of foreign aid as being "fundamental to our national
   security and any sensible long-term strategy to battle extremism."

     "The Justice Department's investigation of national security leaks
     offers a recent example of the challenges involved in striking the
     right balance between our security and our open society. As
     Commander-in Chief, I believe we must keep information secret that
     protects our operations and our people in the field. To do so, we
     must enforce consequences for those who break the law and breach
     their commitment to protect classified information. But a free press
     is also essential for our democracy. I am troubled by the
     possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative
     journalism that holds government accountable. Journalists should not
     be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those
     who break the law."

   A media shield law will still be a heavy lift in Congress, but I'm glad
   it's part of Obama's comprehensive vision.

     "The AUMF is now nearly twelve years old. The Afghan War is coming
     to an end. Core al Qaeda is a shell of its former self. Groups like
     AQAP must be dealt with, but in the years to come, not every
     collection of thugs that labels themselves al Qaeda will pose a
     credible threat to the United States. Unless we discipline our
     thinking and our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we don't
     need to fight, or continue to grant Presidents unbound powers more
     suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states. So I
     look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts
     to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF's mandate. And I will not
     sign laws designed to expand this mandate further. Our systematic
     effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue. But this
     war, like all wars, must end. That's what history advises. That's
     what our democracy demands."

   This is no small moment. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the United
   States adopted a war footing -- and never stopped. What Obama is
   describing here is a fundamental shift.

   As for the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, this is when
   protestors began interrupting the speech, but Obama nevertheless
   characterized the prison as a facility that needs to be closed and
   "should never have been opened." The president is asking for Congress
   to lift the restrictions; he's appointing a new envoy to complete
   transfers; and he will demand "judicial review be available for every
   detainee."

   And what about those protestors? It was interesting to hear Obama
   express some sympathy for their perspective, saying he's willing to cut
   one of his interrupting critics "some slack, because it's worth being
   passionate about." After another interruption, he added, "The voice of
   that woman is worth paying attention to. Obviously I do not agree with
   much of what she said. And obviously she wasn't listening to me and
   much of what I said. But these are tough issues, and the suggestion
   that we can gloss over them is wrong."

   It would have been easy for the president to ignore these critics, or
   dismiss their outbursts as fringe nonsense. I'm glad Obama chose a more
   substantive approach.

   These are just some of the elements from my notes, and whether you
   agree with it or not, the video of the speech is worth your time. For
   real analysis, I'd strongly recommend tuning into MSNBC tonight at 9
   p.m. eastern.

   Simply put.

   Let's say Iran found that there was an ex-Iranian, who had been
   involved with terrorist activities living in Israel.

   They either send in a special forces group, or use a drone to take the
   person out while they are on Israeli soil.

   Would the Obama administration allow them the same rights that we
   claim?

   Why should we indanger the lives of true American Fighting men for a
   few weasels.

   Anwar al-Awlaki was killed on Sept. 30, 2011 in a CIA drone strike in
   Yemen, the first known time a U.S.-controlled drone strike deliberately
   targeted and killed an American citizen. The killing [24]prompted
   praise from Obama, who called it a "major blow to al Qaeda's most
   active operational affiliate."

   This man made his own bed..........

   Strange that they give these guys citizen ship, yet adamantly deny
   Obama's citizenship. Rabid racist.

   I was in Dubai when Mossad came in with about a dozen operatives, and
   kidnapped and killed an Arab staying at a local hotel. Mossad used
   forged passports from several countries, including Canada. They broke
   several international laws and treaties during this action, and they
   have never been held accountable.

   Does that answer your question?

   The president is on the right track now. Time to end the Bush era wars
   and go after the terrorists in an efficient way. Too many Americans
   have died because of the failed policies of the previous
   administration. Right wingers are utterly clueless about the rules of
   war. Time to let some intelligent men and women use updated, more
   humane methods of fighting these terrorists.

   AND, TIME TO CLOSE GITMO, Mr. President You are the commander-in-chief.
   Do not let a bunch of crazy, bigoted, ignorant, close -minded, Tea
   party Republicans in the house and Senate make the rules. They have no
   empathy nor compassion for human beings at all. The place is a horror,
   and Americans are better than this. Some innocent men are dying there.
   END IT!

   End it now! People are being tortured there.

   American Presidents currently have the power to make war on anyone they
   identify as a terrorist. It will take an act of Congress to take that
   blank check back.

   .

   I like Obama speeches, but I don't get what traction he thinks this
   will give him. If we didn't have 60 votes in the Senate for non
   universal background checks after 20 young children were brutally
   slaughtered, what makes the President think a speech is going to
   deliver the 60 votes needed to take back the War Powers blank check?
   And what about the House? Is Boehner going away, or can we see him
   singing anti- perpetual war songs?

   .

   Once again, I don't see much of anything happening with this or any
   other substantive policy question until we take back the House and blow
   away the rules requiring 60 votes to get anything done in the Senate.

   dog, yes as long as iran was at war with israel or the killer had fled
   to israel to escape being captured or killed. if you are talking about
   the use of drones as a killing machine, you are not so naive as to
   think we don't have secret agreements with almost all of the arab
   countries do you? when we are in a war footing as we are now, almost
   anything goes, almost. to follow an enemy to a foreign country and kill
   them is certainly not unusual, perhaps the method, but not the result.
   i think you would agree that to give enemy combatants a safe haven
   anywhere in the world would be a huge mistake on our part. as the
   president said it will be virtually impossible to totally eliminate all
   terrorist groups, but we must do what we can as a nation to protect
   ourselves from the harm that these people will do to us whenever they
   can. war is a dirty, slimy, bloody mess, and many innocent people get
   killed. that unfortunately is what you get involved in while trying to
   protect the people.

   about putting a sock in it! and secondly a journalist doesn't have any
   constitutional duty, his duty is to write columns for his news service.
   if he uses his contacts to get classified information i believe he or
   she is guilty of crimes against the united states, and should be
   punished accordingly. if that news hawk released information that got
   your son or daughter killed you would be jumping on the wagon to have
   that person arrested and tried. but when things do not affect you
   personally you could care less. there are many of us on this blog that
   do care about others and do not want to see innocent people hurt or

   It has been well affirmed by the courts multiple times that this
   journalist is protected by the first amendment. If classified
   information is released, it is the individual that leaks the
   information who is possibly guilty of a crime ( within the obama
   government)- criminalizing a journalist for asking questions and
   getting answers flies in the face of the Constitution and the freedom
   of the press. Imagine a country where reporters can't seek answers on
   important national security issues on behalf of the people?

   tell everything. life isn't like that elmer, people are not like that,
   no one is like that. the reporter and the leaker had some sort of a
   deal. either the reporter paid for the info or the gop got the person
   to leak the story. if the reporter knew that the documents were secret
   or classified and he printed them anyway, he broke the law, it is that
   simple. there is no 1st amendment rights that allows anyone to get

   You've obviously never spent any time in a prison or a jail cell.
   People who are innocent of any crime are thrown in jails and prisons

   "A media shield law will still be a heavy lift in Congress, but I'm

   F the media! The media not victims. They hardly ever do their jobs,
   anyway.

   I bet the media got all excited about that part of his speech, and it's
   probably the only part a lot of the media heard. But, before that,
   President Obama said he believes the Justice Dept. also has a right to
   do their jobs, and pursue, and prosecute people who leak classified
   information, because it's a crime. President Obama did not say the
   Justice Dept. would stop investigating leaks. Basically, President
   Obama proposed more "protections" for the media, but said the Justice
   Dept. will still prosecute people who leak classified information, if
   they catch them. In a way, President Obama kind of gave the media the
   middle-finger.

   @Taylor: Yeah, F*ck the media you say. On a media website. I'm not sure
   where you get your news, but that is of little consequence. If the DOJ
   can silence whistleblowers by seizing their contact information and
   tapping their phones, the days of getting any news the government
   doesn't want released are over. If the sources don't talk, then the
   media can't report. At that point, websites like this one are wasted
   server space.

   @joca41: That headline example isn't comparable to what happened here.
   The story that sparked the DOJ investigation was about a military
   action that had already happened, and in no way put our troops at risk.

   And as for the public's right to know

   @Glenn: The supreme court ruled in NY Times V. United States that even
   in the face of impending nuclear holocaust, the government doesn't have
   the right to impede the freedom of the press. That's pretty close to a
   quote Justice Brennan wrote, striking the governments ability to censor
   the press.

   What if we were talking about the 2nd amendment? Would you all be
   saying f*ck the NRA? Because basically what you're all saying is that
   the 1st Amendment should be thrown out. I find that notion disgusting.

   Well, I have to say I am at a loss here. I do not like any of it, but
   when we have extremists attacking us, drones beat boots on the ground?
   I want neither, I want an end to all this.

   I can't stand innocents harmed or dying for extremist actions.

   All I can say is, if people had turned in AQ, OBL and tried on their
   own to quell extremists in their own land, maybe we would not be in
   this situation.

   Kuwait asked for our help, we had Saudis wanting our help. We saw the
   problem of Saddam torching oil wells. Then OBL decides he would call
   Jihad against us. We moved our base out of S.A. Protectionism, is that
   really preferable to just getting along?

   What can I say? I wish none of that stuff happened. I wish OBL had not
   decided he wanted a war with us and attack innocents in NYC.

   I wish Afghanistan had more than heroin and oil to sell and had their
   own interests. I wish Saddam had not decided to take Kuwait and Saudi
   Arabia. We try to help, we see the upside to girls learning. But
   extremists do not want that, they feel we bring Western culture there,
   but we were invited there. Westerners buy oil and heroin, but just buy
   it, go away and stay out.

   I never wanted to attack Iraq. Justice was needed, but no justice found
   until we find OBL in Pakistan, where they have nukes. Now we have
   murders in Boston, London and wherever lust for the blood shows next.

   Some day I hope for peace. I know, good luck with that, right?

   I agree with you 100%. Had Bush stayed in Tora Bora where bin Laden and
   those responsible for 9-11 were we wouldn't even be having this
   conversation. But Bush had to invade Iraq which stirred up the hornets
   nest. The documentary Rachel about Bush and Iraq is excellent. From

   killing innocents is by far worse than killing those seeking to kill
   you. FAR WORSE. Killing innocents breeds contempt and revenge for
   generations. It fuels the fire and spreads like fire.

   Imagine what the innocent say to others about the "americans who kill
   at will". You dont respect life when you kill life. You cannot respect
   life when you are willing to kill for life. Jesus tried to teach that
   lesson by dying instead of defending. It is a difficult lesson for the
   common person who believes he will never live again.

   Patango, that would have been much more preferable, IMO. We could say,
   if you hand over OBL, we will try him, find him guilty and appropriate
   justice. What would you like done? You can start other businesses than
   heroin. They may request arms, then I don't know. I am not really
   supportive of arming people in foreign lands.

   I hate to think that war would be the first option.

   We spent all that money anyway. We might still have those 4000+ alive
   and however many thousands of dead Iraqis.

   I am pretty much a pacifist. There is some kind of "justification" to
   attack those that attack you. Although in Tibet they project peace
   outward and in the New Testament we are told to turn the other cheek
   and love our enemies.

   Live by the sword, die by the sword. It boggles my mind that all this

   My comment on the Terroist attack in London:

   A CNN anchor tried to spin this as simply a dispute between the

   victim!

   Since Jeff Zucker (formally head of lying MSNBC) took over CNN, it has
   become
   just as much a joke News Network as MSNBC.

   So much for Diversity and multiculturalism, Western countries should
   drastically limit Muslims from immigrating to our countries.

   Both Churchill & Jefferson wrote on how Islam is a direct threat to
   Western society.

   Churchill also said that slavery will never¿be truly abolished as long
   as Islam rules. Referring to the treatment of women and enslavement of
   non-Muslims (it is still going today)!

   Islam legally should NOT be tolerated by any means in our

   Leosky, I don't know how to tell you this, but everyone here already
   knows that "Islamic terrorists" hate us. The real question is what is
   the percentage of those who follow Islam are terrorists? Is it greater,
   less, or the same, as those here who, calling themselves Christians,
   advocate, and carry out, the murder of medical professionals who
   perform abortions? Are you advocating we presume all Muslims are guilty
   until proven innocent? And if so, would that standard also apply to all
   Christians in this country?

   Acts of terrorism should be treated exactly as what they are: crimes.
   Let the FBI, Interpol and the police forces of those countries involved
   handle acts of terrorism just as they handle all other criminal acts.
   Use of military force should always be the last resort, not the "go to"
   solution for frightened politicians.

   It was good he pointed out that collateral damage is often unavoidable,
   that there are no perfect choices, just the less worse ones.

   Innocent people die in military action. It sucks for the people, and
   those who know them, but the alternative is to have many more innocent
   people killed.

   It's hard for some people to wrap their head around the argument, they
   don't see humanity as a whole, that a few people being killed in a
   military strike, while sad and tragic, has little impact on the
   population of humanity as a whole. Thousands of people are born and die
   every day. Human life is precious, but not so precious we should let
   crazy people kill thousands or more later just because we're so against
   a few innocent people getting killed now.

   Sounds barbaric morally, but it makes sense in terms of the numbers and
   the survival of the human race, or at least the less violent of us.

   the biggest difference between DRONING and not droning is the
   relationship of society to undesireable behavior and the difference is
   night and day

   using drones. the society as a whole is at war which changes the
   relationships between the persons comprising the society so as to
   implement within one's own personal relationship - ultimatum to
   others... "FRIEND OR FOE"

     without DRONE-WAR the interpersonal relationships can be presumed to
     be acceptable vs challenged!

   droneless-no-war is a PRIMARY STATE because it FREES the person to have
   a positive attitude to strangers, familiars and associates and not be
   forced to being judgemental. The incidence of undesireable behavior -
   as in an attack of sorts - is then treated as a CRIME.

   This is overall also healthier in that it reduces anxitety and
   apprehension which lowers blood pressure.

   This is also healthier in that it quashes the bad side effect of
   "taking sides" then having to subscribe and run a self fulfilling
   prophecy towards the armageddon syndrome - a really sick manifestation.

   When Brother Barack gets back to declaring all such incidences as
   crimes, people can go back to having NORMAL NEGOTIABLE
   RESPECT-OF-DIFFERENCES RELATIONSHIPS.

   Obviously any leftover hangover sect of insect-styled groups that seek
   to anhilate others as being "the enemy" need to be watched in the event
   any member loses it completely. But that is a state of caution not a
   state of war.

   At Arm's Length

   President Barak Obama, the Pragmatic, Philosophical Poetry Man, sir,
   first I must say that you are a wonderful Role Model of an Enlightened
   Human Being.

   The honest and candidly forthright Conversation that you had with the
   Citizens of the United States of America and the World today about the
   difficulties, complexities, vagaries, definitions (past, present and
   possible future), and changing meanings, policies and strategies of the
   seeming Forever (Perpetual) War, Guantanamo Bay Prison and Drones was
   refreshingly surprising, and well Intentioned. You are an Intelligent,
   Compassionate, Honorable and Well Intentioned Human Being.

   After 9/11, the Whole Wide World was turned into a Battlefield of
   Terrorism. Ah, the Shifting Sands, and Faces, and Places of
   Terrorism.What a slippery, electrifyingly destructive oil and blood
   spill Terrorism thrives and suicidally dies within. And look at the
   U.S. of A. and the rest of the World now, constantly trying to track
   down and locate whatever cracks or crevices of our Security Armor and
   Defenses the contagious Terrorist ooze has infested and infected. Oops
   ! It's hard to truly See what lies sliding around within the Human
   Heart at times. Especially during times of a Forever War's endless
   supply of hurts, hatreds, and grisly pains.

   President Barak Obama, sir, I was so impressed and touched by the
   Respect you attributed to, and bestowed upon, the Protester's Voice of
   Sincere Universal Conscience concerning the closing of Gitmo and the
   deadly Use of Drones. Thank you, sir, for Honoring her as a Citizen's
   Voice Worthy of and Needing to be Heard. You do Great Honor to your
   Office and our Great Nation, sir.

   Thank you for admitting to being Haunted by the Human Beings, guilty
   and innocent, that you have ordered to be killed by Drones, and by the
   means and troops of Conventional War in the Middle East. Thank you for
   drawing down the Wars, and for Asking everyone to Look at the World of
   Wars that we are choosing to Create through the struggles inherent
   within the heinous and Senseless Acts of Terrorism. Terrorists who seek
   violence as a form of accepted Behavior Modification to get more
   Powerful Nations to pay attention to their Needs and Demands, and
   respond to them, because like an Abandoned or Neglected child, any
   Attention is better than no Attention at All.

   Drones are frightening to Human Beings because they are intrusive,
   stealthy, emotionless, deadly Machines.

   Perhaps The Matrix Guys are right in many ways. The Machines - All
   Machines are swallowing People up in varying degrees, and realms of
   UnRealities, Singular Realities and Multi-verse Realities.

   Drones fly by and click, click your Face and Activities show up half
   way around the World in SomeOne else's nosy, sneaky little Reality for
   whatever Reasonings they deem to be important.

   Drones fly by and click, click another Living Human Being is gunned
   down or blown to smithereens for whatever Reasonings are deemed to be
   important by another Human Being (or Chosen Group of Human Beings).
   What was, is no more. One Reality is traded for another.

   What makes it even more complex is that Human Beings are Addicted to
   Machines. We are not merely Dis-tracted, and being Energetically
   changed by them. We are Addicted to them.

   In a few years, we'll have Re-habilitation Clinics opening up around
   the World to Help get our Children, Family Members and Friends Freed
   from the Addiction of constantly being Turned On to and by - Stimulated
   and Living Inside Of Machines. And the Fake/Pretend Virtual Worlds We
   all escape into in order to Create and Re-Create the various Selves and
   Lifetimes we'd like to Live, but Can't, or Won't, or Don't have enough
   Time to Live, at the Push of a Button - the Click of a Mouse.....

   A World of Downloaded Lives and Living instead of Living in the Organic
   Realities We are Choosing more and more to ignore, neglect or leave
   behind.

   A Machine World where We can Hide and/or Reveal Our Secret Selves or
   Our Truer Selves inside Our Computers - Our Machines.

   A World where We can all Live Our Lives at Arm's Length.

   That's what Drones Do. What Drones Represent - a Reality delivering
   Death at Arm's Length.

   That's what Gitmo Represents. A Festering, Infectious and UnHealed
   National Wound. A gangrenous Collective Wound filled with All of 9/11's
   Pain, Fears. Hatreds, Regrets, Loss, UnCertainties, Needs for Punishing
   Revenge and Destruction of the Other.

   It's no surprise that the Gitmo Prisoners are Starving ThemSelves.
   Gitmo is based upon a Nation's Collective Starvation from its Own Laws
   and Sense of and Mechanics of Justice. A Nation Starved for its Own
   True Healing.

   It's Starving Gitmo Prisoners kept for years upon Foreign Soil. A
   National Humiliation and UnFinished Business Kept at Arm's Length.

   Some in Our Congress keep Poverty at Arm's Length, making it easier to
   make their cuts and lacerations into the Lives of the Jobless Poor, the
   Working Poor and the diminishing Middle Class.

   Some in Our Congress and Courts keep the crippling affects/effects of
   the Wall Street Gambling Algorithm addicted and addictions to restless
   movements of any kind - impulses and receptivity of any kind -
   distractions of any kind, and, oh yes, Power of any kind - at Arm's
   Length.

   Some in Our Congress keep the Hungry and UnEducated Children of
   Sequestration, and the Elderly cut off from Meals-on-Wheels by
   Sequestration at Arm's Length.

   Some in Our Congress, and some of Our Governors continue to fight
   against those Needing Affordable Healthcare at Arm's Length.

   Some in Our Congress continue to keep Immigrants from Seeking Refuge,
   and a New and Better Life of Opportunities in America at Arm's Length.

   Some in Our Congress keep Women and Men who are raped in the Military
   at Arm's Length.

   Some in Our Congress keep Gays from Seeking Equal Human Rights under
   the Law at Arm's Length.

   Some in Our Congress keep Veterans returning from Our Wars Dis-abled or
   looking for Work at Arm's Length.

   And the List goes on, and on...at Arm's Length.

   We have BeCome a Nation kept at Arm's Length, Living in a World that
   some in Our Congress would like to keep at Arm's Length.

   UnFortunately, that sort of Energetic Karma does have a tendency to
   Gobble Individuals and Collectives Up and Spit Them Out into the Black
   Void of Cosmic Oblivion eventually. But, not to worry, because the
   Remains BeCome the Cosmic Stuff of New Worlds and New Realities kept at
   Arm's Length.

   However, you, President Barak Obama are a proven Leader, whom I may not
   always agree with, but whose Honorable, Thoughtfully Wise and
   Compassionate Soul this Citizen will never Seek to hold at Arm's
   Length.

   And he has kept his zipper shut.

   But really he has had to deal with the WORST Congress in History!

   What should we do with the people from Gitmotel 6? Since most of their
   own countries don't wnt them back?

   It would be reasonable to assume, based on the difference between the
   president's statements and his actions, that there will be no change in
   policy.

   Likely this is merely blowing off your steam.

   Rachel is one of the few media people who has both the background and
   the wisdom to appreciate the reference to political philosophy that I
   made in the NY Times yesterday:

   The political background of the speech must include the Republicans'
   self-contradictory position involving their enthusiastic support of the
   war on terror and their simultaneous opposition to increasing the
   powers of the presidency as that seemingly perpetual war continues. In
   "Democracy in America," Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out that the
   longer the war, the more power accumulated by the executive: "No
   protracted war can fail to endanger the freedom of a democratic
   country....it must almost compulsorily concentrate the direction of all
   men and the management of all things in the hands of the
   administration. If it does not lead to despotism by sudden violence, it
   prepares men for it more gently by their habits. All those who seek to
   destroy the liberties of a democratic nation ought to know that
   [perpetual] war is the surest and the shortest means to accomplish
   it."

   Umm,... 44: The war on terror, "like all wars, must end" Try telling
   that to the victims of terrorism and the terrorists that are trying to
   kill you and us all. His acts and statements defend islam more then the
   US Constitution. Seems it is impossible for him to keep his Oath. How
   many more super rude and smart remarks can you keep saying to insult us
   all and how many more innocent people need to keep dying do to your
   gross negligence and giving terrorists Carte Blanche to kill Americans
   like it shooting fish in a barrel.
