   Here's a live video stream of President Obama's speech on the economy
   from at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois:

   IFRAME: [29]http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mp_Tscq4UZs?rel=0

   The speech, titled "A better bargain for the middle class" is scheduled
   to begin at 12:55 ET. The White House has signaled that it represents
   the start of a major and sustained push to advance the president's
   second-term economic agenda. We will provide live updates throughout
   the speech including the text of the remarks when they become
   available.

   [30]9:55 AM PT: BTW, in case you were concerned that Republicans
   weren't paying attention, they are paying so much attention that Mitch
   McConnell and Senate Republicans have already trashed the speech.
   [31]Before it was even delivered.

   [32]10:01 AM PT: As Jonathan Weisman [33]detailed this morning in the
   New York Times, the president's biggest challenge is Republican control
   of the House of Representatives, where the GOP majority is taking an
   axe to program after program supported by President Obama and
   Democrats.

   [34]10:10 AM PT: If you're just tuning in, don't worry, you haven't
   missed anything--things are running a bit behind schedule.

   [35]10:13 AM PT: President Obama walks on the stage, rudely
   interrupting discussions about Mayor Anthony Weiner on both FNC and
   MSNBC.

   [36]10:15 AM PT: And we're underway. Here are the remarks [37]as
   prepared.

   [38]10:20 AM PT: President Obama emphasizes this line in his prepared
   remarks: "The link between higher productivity and people's wages and
   salaries was severed - the income of the top 1% nearly quadrupled from
   1979 to 2007, while the typical family's barely budged" with
   extemporaneous comments about how rising corporate profits haven't been
   linked to rising family incomes.
   [39]10:26 AM PT:
   [40][affb0d904af2a4f06451d62ab470a2bd_normal.jpeg] And...... fox news
   goes to break
   -- [41]@samsteinhp

   [42]10:28 AM PT: After talking about the ways in which the economy has
   improved since the Great Recession, President Obama says that there's
   more work to be done. Despite rising profits, he says, most people
   aren't seeing the benefits. "In many ways, the trends that I spoke of
   here in 2005 - of a winner-take-all economy where a few do better and
   better, while everybody else just treads water - have been made worse
   by the recession. And that's a problem. This growing inequality--not
   just of outcome, but also opportunity--isn't just morally wrong; it's
   bad economics."

   [43]10:29 AM PT: Reversing the trend of inequality, says Obama, is his
   top priority, and must be Washington's top priority. But, he says, over
   the last two years (since Republicans reclaimed the House), Washington
   is making it worse, citing the debt limit crisis and sequestration.
   And, he says, over the past six months Republican obstruction has
   gotten worse--in the House. He says a handful of Senate Republicans
   have been working towards compromise, but the House Republicans have
   been steadfast in their obstruction, citing immigration reform and the
   farm bill.

   [44]10:33 AM PT: Obama says it's wrong for Republicans to cite out of
   control government spending as an argument for their obstruction,
   because the deficit has fallen by half as a share of the economy, and
   because they've already made major spending cuts.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       And as far as timing, he the Amash amendment is new, BUT the "hot
       seat" issue of the NSA staggering revelations of over-reach have
       been going on for nearly a month.
       So, as a reality check, what is in this speech on how he's going to
       do something for the 99% aside from putting a idiot in charge of
       the Federal Reserve?
       I SO wish it were a conspiracy theory. I wish we could wake up from
       this nightmare and believe that:
       1.  Their interpretation of who is and is not a journalist is what
       determines whether you're an enemy of the state or a
       reporter--except in reality the WH came out with a statement saying
       no one should worry if they are "legitimate" journalist (and they
       said that does not include bloggers--so WATCH OUT future
       pamphleteers like Thomas Paine!)
       2  The tax dollars spent on the FOR PROFIT snoop industry didn't
       come at the expense of middle class and infrastructure -- and the
       4th Amendment--except in reality our school and bridges are failing
       and the budget for the Hoovering of the entire planet is getting
       paid for -- not by multinational corporations-- but by the
       underclass, the 90%!
       3. That journalists cannot be persecuted for investigative
       journalism Daniel Ellsberg style, except in reality earlier this
       week the court just came out and ruled against the free press doing
       investigative journalism on matters of anything deemed helpful to
       the enemy.

       are a good indication that we're over the hump.  The lack of jobs
       is not a real problem.  Edward Snowden is a super creep who ran to

   Obama will refer to a program my university has started to get students

       the President proposed a major jobs bill before the last election I
       believe, and they did nothing with it, just like they'll do nothing
       with all his proposals now. In case you haven't noticed the
       President isn't Speaker of the House, and it's controlled by
       Republicans who want to block or undermine everything he does or
       wants to do.
       But to say he hasn't done or proposed anything regarding jobs or
       the economy is a bald-faced lie.  Either that or you're so ignorant
       of recent history that you really shouldn't be commenting on the
       subject at all.

   The increased funds to the NIH saved a hell of a lot of researchers'
   projects and families.  We didn't appreciate Congress cutting the funds
   back as soon as it could, but prior to the stimulus, I personally was
   out of funding making choices between heat, new shoes and coats for my
   kids who had outgrown them and were being ridiculed by their teachers
   for being too stupid to wear coats in winter, or housing and food
   (housing and food won). My coworkers were about to lose their jobs.
   Many labs were about to go under.

   I saw direct benefits to entire divisions, lab after lab, and the
   infrastructure that supports those labs.  That's just from a tiny, long
   overdue and not nearly what it should have been increase in funding to
   the NIH.

   Am I sorry it didn't affect you personally? Absolutely and sincerely.
   It should have been far bigger, and it should not have been cut back by
   the austerity obsessed congress. But to state that it had no effect
   because it didn't affect everyone is inaccurate.  I am grateful for
   what it did for me, my coworkers, many other labs and industries.

 Some of us are not banks, nor any other type ([602]0+ / 0-)

   of corporation. I'd wager that most of us received no benefit from the
   "stimulus", though there are definitely some individuals who are not
   bankers and brokers, such as auto workers and various others who did.
   That said, most of the focus has been on wall street, as usual, which
   somehow gets confused with "the economy" in this country. That's why
   the economic go to people have mostly been Rubinite neo-liberals.

       The White House web site still says:

     He believes that no current beneficiaries should see their basic
     benefits reduced and he will not accept an approach that slashes
     benefits for future generations.  The President also stands firmly
     opposed to privatization and rejects the notion that the future of
     hard-working Americans should be left to the fluctuations of
     financial markets.
       He appears to only commit to BASIC benefits for CURRENT
       beneficiaries which would still appear to include C-CPI and even
       cuts in BASIC benefits for FUTURE retirees.

     If he cared about the middle class, he wouldn't have reduced his
     ambitions on raising the minimum wage over the past four years.

     He might have worked with Pelosi and Reid to get such legislation
     passed when Dems had control.

   There are two separate points there.

    The first one relates to what he puts on his agenda.  He has lowered
   his ambitions on raising the minimum wage.  In 2008, he pledged to
   raise it to $9.50 and index it to inflation.  His pledge has since
   dropped $0.50.  My point there was not legislation.  It was on framing
   and agenda-setting.

   The latter relates to when the Democrats had control of both Houses.

   Obviously, you won't get a minimum wage hike under Republicans.  But
   it's a shame that you didn't under Democrats.

   Reform tax code to make it fairer, less burdensome on middle-lower
   income taxpayers.

   1.  Eliminate all preferential treatment of "unearned" income.

   2.  Limit the home mortgage deduction by confining it to the first $2
   million of a residence's value.

   3.  Add two more top rates for incomes in excess of $5 million and $10
   million.

   4.  Apply estate tax to all estates in excess of $2 million.

   Finally, eliminate the cap on income subject to payroll tax.

 The coasts should scream ([1093]0+ / 0-)
       Fact is $750k will barely buy a decent condo in metro areas on the

       realities of real estate prices.  But the principle should be that
       rich people who live in very expensive houses shouldn't get to
       deduct all of their mortgage costs.
       Frankly, I'd settle for eliminating deferential treatment of
       "unearned" income - would grab a lot more $ from the 1% than even
       raising rates would.

       mortgage,you are distinctly upper middle or maybe,lower upper.
       Beats me;) What I do know is that the median family income in CA is
       around 60k.So well over 50% of families could not qualify for a
       vanilla,750K mortgage. I also know that 75% of the dollars from the
       mortgage interest deduction go to just three places: New York City,
       the Bay Area and LA.
       Mortgage interest deduction (as it exists) is no longer useful
       public policy,but it is politically popular and easy to demagogue
       on and so it is here to stay...until it goes away.

       Maybe what I should be saying is that upper middle class in the Bay
       Area and upper middle class in Des Moines are two entirely
       different things.  In parts of the country where the over-all cost
       of living is higher, your annual income needs to be much higher.
       Of course, if we just did away with all deductions, exemptions,
       etc., including those for child care, maybe we could reduce rates
       to make up the difference for middle-lower income wage earners.

   Everyone (liberals and conservatives) already knows Who brought us to

   For whatever reasons, Obama has become Dem lite.  Unless he lights a

   2010 and Obama will end his term by getting nothing done facing a

     In an age when jobs know no borders, companies will also seek out
     the country that boasts the most talented citizens, and reward them
     with good pay.  The days when the wages for a worker with a
     high-school degree could keep pace with the earnings of someone who
     got some higher education are over.  Technology and global
     competition aren't going away.  So we can either throw up our hands
     and resign ourselves to diminished living standards, or we can do
     what America has always done: adapt, pull together, fight back and
     win.

   Translation: "We want cheap foreign labor to keep driving down wages of
   US workers.  We want people who have college degrees tomorrow to earn
   the equivalent of what people with high school degrees earned 30 years
   ago.  People with high school degrees only, you get minimum wage."

   It looks like the cheap labor corporate Dems have a specific salary and
   standard of living scale they want to implement and a timetable for
   doing it.

       That translates into hiring foreign high tech and STEM workers at

       There have been quite a few diaries here at DKos that provide an
       inside look at the problem - companies claiming they can't find
       enough highly skilled workers when they actually aren't looking
       domestically.  Many companies (and some universities) only
       advertise job openings overseas or with the H1B visa labor pools.
       They interview US skilled workers as a front, but they don't hire

       It's a real problem for US STEM workers with advanced degrees in

       you still believe the President is the guy you thought he was in
       2007/2008 and you listen to him that way.
       I don't. I can't. I'd like to but I can't. There are too many
       places on the Administration timeline that tell me he is not going
       to fight to help people. The speech sounds nice but even here there
       are hints that he's going to go in what I consider the wrong
       direction.

       Why don't you look at my diaries from 2007.
       So you don't like Barack Obama.   So what.
       The fact he talks about economic inequality matters.  Better than
       those who ignore it.
       The plain fact is that Hillary Clinton will be the next president
       and she is not as progressive as Obama.  No, Sherrod Brown and
       Elizabeth Warren are not running.  So get used to being
       marginalized.

 Strange plans for retirement security ([1460]4+ / 0-)

     Unfortunately, over the past decade, too many families watched their
     retirement recede from their grasp.  Today, a rising stock market
     has millions of retirement balances rising.  But we still live with
     an upside-down system where those at the top get generous tax
     incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking Americans
     get none at all. As we work to reform our tax code, we should find
     new ways to make it easier for workers to put money away, and free
     middle-class families from the fear that they'll never be able to
     retire.  And if Congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get
     started, they don't have to look far: economists show that
     immigration reform that makes undocumented workers pay their full
     share of taxes would actually shore up Social Security for years.

   Cut SS (we know this is on the table)

   Tax incentives to get people to invest in the stock market through
   IRA's and 401 K's (that's how we got in this mess)

   Shore up SS (which isn't in trouble if we get back to full employment)
   by using immigration reform to increase payments to SS trust fund (CBO
   analysis of the Immigration Reform Bill shows it will increase
   unemployment)

       Wall Street has tried these approaches in the past during Reagan,
       Bush and Clinton administrations.  Always trying to find new ways
       to siphon off SS funds to the stock market.
       I fear this language means they'll try (again) to pass a law
       allowing people to divert some of the SS contributions into IRA's,
       etc.  The first time they tried, they managed to get laws passed to
       create IRA's and later 401 K's.
       Now they know they'll be pushing wages down in years to come, so
       people won't have the extra funds to put into the Wall Street
       casino. To increase Wall Street's flow of retirement funds, they
       want to go directly to the SS stream.  They'll settle for the
       federal government's stream of tax income, but that's less secure
       long term.  It also perpetuates the deficit spending issue.
       Ugh, why does Obama listen to these vultures?

 retirement balances rising? ([1498]0+ / 0-)

   My "professionally managed" retirement fund -- with an "asset
   preservation" goal -- went into a tailspin in August 2007 and has yet
   to come close to recovering, let alone rising above where it was six
   years ago.  Once the money was gone, it was gone; there was no money
   left to reinvest when the market supposedly took off again.  And last
   month, yet again, the vastly reduced balance I held onto lost yet
   another large chunk of its "value."  Yes, I know that there are no
   guarantees when one invests, but when reputable Wall Street firms are
   allowed to get away with this kind of thievery, with no censure
   whatsoever for false advertising about the possibilities and no
   responsibility for offering faulty products, one has to wonder.
