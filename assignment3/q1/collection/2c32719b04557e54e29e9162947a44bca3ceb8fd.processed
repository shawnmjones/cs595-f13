America's Future: Education

     I recently read and reviewed That Used to Be Us, a new book on how
     to strengthen America's economic competitiveness. I sat down with
     co-author Thomas Friedman for a probing conversation about the
     vitally important issues raised by the book.

   This video excerpt from [15]America's Future: A Conversation with Bill
   Gates and Thomas Friedman focuses on education.
