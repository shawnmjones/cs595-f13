   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   Round 2

   On Inauguration Day 2009, I went all kum bah ya on America's ass.
   Seriously, this is how my post started:

     For One Day
     No cynicism
     No anger
     No rage
     No rants
     No fuming
     No fighting

   And on and on like that...  It seemed right. We were fighting two wars
   and we'd just taken a massive economic dump in our pants while driving
   into a massive economic ditch because we blew a massive economic head
   gasket. I had this naïve schoolboy fantasy that maybe Republicans would
   extend to Obama the same courtesy that Democrats had extended to the
   previous president when he started out. Instead, at the height of a
   national calamity that happened on that previous president's watch,
   they immediately summoned their inner asshole and became the "Party of
   No."

   On steroids.

   So here we are. Four years later. Obama begins his second term
   following a decisive re-election victory. And this inauguration-day
   post is slightly different than 2009's. My message is simple, and it
   goes out to some specific people for their contributions during Obama's
   first term:
   President Obama's official second-term portrait photo, taken Dec. 6,
   2012.
   "He's baaaaack!!!"

                                 "Suck it."

     To Rush Limbaugh, who said "I hope he fails" on inauguration day:
     Suck it. He didn't.

     To the birthers, whose claims about Barack HUSSEIN Obama's
     "questionable" citizenship were nothing but racism cloaked in
     concern-trollery: Suck it. He's a two term Kenyan president now.

     To Mitch McConnell, who said his #1 goal was to make Barack Obama "a
     one-term president": Suck it, turtleman. #44 is #44 for another 4.

     To John Boehner, who as House minority leader yelled "Hell NO you
     can't!" to Obama's first-term agenda: Suck it. Hell YES he could!

     To former South Carolina senator and tea party organizer Jim DeMint,
     who said the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would be
     "Obama's Waterloo": Suck it. It so wasn't.

     To the tea party idiots who hoisted signs at their Obamacare protest
     rallies that read, "Bury Obamacare with Ted Kennedy": I'd rather
     bury your ideas with Reagan. Suck it, jerks.

     To Mitt Romney, who ran the most classless and bullshit-dense
     campaign of any presidential candidate in my memory: Here's
     something you can scrawl on your Etch-A-Sketch: S-U-C-K-I-T.

     To Dick Cheney, who said America would be less safe under Obama:
     sir, the attacks of 9/11/01---and there were four of them---happened
     on your watch. Obama killed bin Laden and there were no al Qaeda
     attacks on American soil. So suck it. Right after you take a
     remedial gun-safety course.

     To all those ignorant fools who called Barack Obama a Muslim, a
     Kenyan and/or a socialist as if those are all inherently and
     self-evidently "bad" things: grow the fuck up. Right after you suck
     it.

     To Sean Hannity, Karl Rove and Dick Morris: Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
     Ha!!!!!!!!! Suck it.

     To the Wall Street banksters, who..... who.....  hell, I can't even
     begin to write the words that describe your obscene, cold-hearted,
     destructive, greedy and soulless behavior over the past four years.
     Just suck it.

     To all the governors and state legislatures that tried their
     damndest to rig election laws so they favored Romney over Obama:
     Suck it. All you did was ensure that voters were more committed than
     ever to making sure their votes were counted.

   And to President Barack Hussein Obama, who withstood all the slime,
   slop and sleaze that the conservatives' political, financial and media
   catapults could hurl at him: Carry on. Congratulations. And enjoy your
   day.

   Cheers and Jeers starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!]

   Cheers and Jeers for Monday, January 21, 2013

   Martin Luther King, Jr.
   Happy Your Day, sir.
   CHEERS to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  Once again we're thankful, and
   rather awestruck, by what he accomplished for black America---and,
   consequently, all of America---in his way-too-short life. He was
   flawed, as all humans are. But he had that stubborn 'ol dream. And come
   hell or high water (or fire hoses or guns or nightsticks or jail time
   or whatever else the bigots could throw at the movement) he refused to
   shut up and sit down, or match violence with violence:

     "Non-violence is a powerful and just weapon which cuts without
     wounding and ennobles the man who wields it.  It is a sword that
     heals."

   Oh, and remember: there's no mail today, which also means no bills
   today. Thank you, Reverend.

   JEERS to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  Once again, we didn't get a
   single Martin Luther King Jr. Day card in the mail (we sent out 150),
   no Martin Luther King Jr. Day presents under our Martin Luther King Jr.
   Day tree and, as usual, radio stations are way overdoing the Martin
   Luther King Jr. Day carols.  But the Martin Luther King Jr. Day
   mattress sales are pretty decent.  If you have a dream of no money down
   and no payments 'til 2014, c'mon down!

   CHEERS to preserving, protecting and defending the Constitution of the
   United States.  [FlipFlipFlip...]  Ah, here it is: the 20th Amendment
   says that the POTUS and VPOTUS have to be sworn in on January 20th---no
   ifs, ands or buts.  And that's what they did yesterday.  You can see
   Obama [31]doing the deed here.  (Spoiler Alert: "Good job, daddy,"
   Sasha said. "I did it," Obama replied. "You didn't mess up," Sasha
   said.)  He was in-and-out in a flash.  Not so with Joe Biden, who
   seemed like he had an all-day kegger lined up afterward.  Since his
   boss will get all the attention today, here's Joe's moment:

   IFRAME: [32]http://www.youtube.com/embed/tiO8SpWf4BQ

   And in other news, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan spent their Sunday quietly
   not being sworn in for anything.  The republic endures.

   JEERS to moments we wish we could take back.  Fifteen years ago, on
   January 21, 1998, allegations of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica
   Lewinsky first became public via The Washington Post.  The president
   was later impeached by the House when it was discovered that his Oval
   Office blow jobs resulted in the deaths of nearly 4,000 American
   soldiers at a cost of over two trillion dollars.  Thank god his
   successor restored integrity to the White House, huh.

   JEERS to fumble fingers, Part I.  If you missed the NFL action over the
   weekend, here's what I saw: one team out of four sucked donkey balls.
   It wasn't Baltimore or San Francisco or Atlanta.  No, it was New
   England, which apparently woke up at noon and straggled in from the Pee
   Wee league lookin' for the beer tent around 6:29.  So it'll be San
   Francisco vs. Baltimore on February 3rd during [33]Super Bowl 20 + 17 +
   5 + 4 +1.  As usual, the winner will be the ads.

   JEERS to fumble fingers, Part II.  Conservatives, reacting to their
   fear that the government wants to take away their guns even though no
   one wants to take away their guns, made a big show of their love of
   guns and gun safety during Saturday's nationwide "Gun Appreciation
   Day."  In fact, they appreciated their guns so much that they
   [34]accidentally shot five people.  Message received.  Although
   probably not the one they wanted to send.

   CHEERS to the king of the swingers.  Happy 73rd birthday to fellow Ohio
   native and "Golden Bear" Jack Nicklaus who, appropriately enough, won
   73 PGA tournaments---including a record 18 majors---during his career
   and never came within a mile of a steroid.  Jack's that rarest of
   birds: a country club Republican with class.  (Although palling around
   [35]with Mitt Romney last year oughtta be a two-stroke penalty in my
   book.)

   -

   Five years ago in C&J: January 21, 2008

   JEERS to Fredmentum.  Damn---Fred Thompson's bulwark state, South
   Carolina, just wasn't feelin' the love for him Saturday.  John McCain
   won the Republican primary (Huckabee was a close second), and gave a
   victory speech in which he said Americans were on their own and he'd
   spend an awful lot of money on guns.

   But the real jaw-dropper of the night was the new theme song chosen by
   McCain himself (I kid you not): ABBA's "Take A Chance on Me."  Memo to
   the maverick: you just sent out a "dog whistle" code to gay people
   across the country essentially saying, "See ya at the next rave,
   girlfriend!"  (I may have to give Ol' Sugarbuns a second look.)

   -

   And Just One More:

   CHEERS to a preview of coming attractions.  How will President Obama
   and Congress get anything done during his second term?  I'm glad you
   asked!  Here's how:

   IFRAME: [36]http://www.youtube.com/embed/HnnMOx9_eBY

   Just add carrots, sticks, gavels and headlocks.

   Okay---gotta go pick up my tuxedo t-shirt at the cleaners.  Big day
   ahead.  Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?

   -

     Today's Shameless C&J Testimonial:

     Having thus imported to you my cheerseths and jeerseths, as they
     have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together, I shall
     take my present leave.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Screaming out "you lie" during the President's address to the congress
   regarding the ACA. He may have become a hero in the freak show that is
   the GOP but he got his nose rubbed in it by the ACA passing AND Obama
   being re-elected. So suck it Joe Wilson! Looks like YOU were the big

   something a lot less.

   Cheers to the camera shots of the First Family arriving at St. John's -
   I heart them all.
   Cheers to pomp and circumstance.
   Cheers to the invention of the internet tubes and live streaming, and
   Cheers to bosses who will be doing the same thing :)
   Cheers to celebrating MLK today (& serendipity)
   Cheers to all of you!

   going DOWN!")

   Cheers to my family, my friends, and my pooties -- King Oliver,

   And cheers to music, without which my head would explode at least three
   times before noon. Here's a taste of the brilliance I saw last night.
   Enjoy!

   date and time for the in person interview this week?!?!?!?!?!  You
   called me last Tuesday night and said you'd email the information.  I
   know I said I'd prefer a late Thursday or any time Friday interview,
   but.... knowing when will relieve some of my anxiety!!

   I spent some time over the weekend looking up all the 3rd party
   software listed in the job description and typed up a cheat sheet
   listing them.  I've also typed up a list of general questions to ask -
   ie - what would be expected of me in the first 6 months, 12 months?
   How many people on the team?  How will performance be evaluated?  Is
   there an 'oncall' rotation?  things like that....

   Cheers for MLK Day coinciding with the Inauguration.

   Jeers to too much Tom Brokaw on Today droning on about how Reagan
   didn't want to get out of bed to attend his first inauguration.

   Jeers to the Today Show for having both Brokaw and Jenna Bush to spin
   stories about Reagan and Bush I & II.

   Democratic Leaders must be very clear they stand with the working class
   of our country. Democrats must hold the line in demanding that deficit
   reduction is done fairly -- not on the backs of the elderly, the sick,
   children and the poor.

       Thanksgiving (for the last time in a while, perhaps, with him off

       got a lovely opportunity to visit Maui over Christmas, and went

   I LOVE canoeing. We used to camp every summer on Black Lake in the
   Adirondack foothills. I used to get up pre-dawn, no matter how hungover
   I might be, and scoot onto the lake for the sunrise. Just me and a few
   diehard fishermen. Solitude. Nothing but birdsong. Watching the mist
   burn off the lake's surface in the first sunbeams of the day.

   If I coulda bottled it, I'd be rich. Such peace...

   Aaaaaahhhhh...

   And all that from a simple picture of a canoe. Thank you, surfdog. I
   needed that.

   This time, substantively so.

   You left off the option that seems to me, not just possible, but
   actually the most likely outcome.  I would actually say that it's
   almost inevitable that the Rs get even more radical, more unhinged, in
   the second term.  In fact, just to show how off the hinges they've
   pushed me, I put the odds at both parties surviving until 2017 at no
   better than 50%.

   The Rs are going to be pushed inexorably further Right by the internal
   dynamics of the competition with the Ds that they themselves set up.

   Obama and the Ds seem finally to be starting to understand that
   compromise doesn't work with the current Rs.  Their political tactics
   of attack are already so far ahead of any actual publc policy agenda,
   that they really can't agree to any offer.  Our side is already
   offering public policy concessions well to the right of anything they
   actually want or could publicly support.  They can't take yes for an
   answer, they have no choice but to keep attacking -- not because their
   public policy goals are still unmet -- but simply because the attack is
   all they have, and they must be on the attack continuously to survive.

   And they can't retreat in the face of the counter-attack that our side
   seem finally ready to start.  They've gotten themselves so
   overextended, so far beyond public opinion, on public policy and
   political tactics, that even stopping for a pause, much less backing
   off, risks being perceived as an admission of extremism.  They
   certainly can't afford to even pause because our side is fighting back
   and accusing them of extremism, without even a pause in their advance
   being seen as an admission of extremism.

   I see their side pushing this over the brink unless they suddenly
   regain a sense of where they and the country truly stand, and a
   conscience about that situation.  The odds aren't good on that for them
   as a group, however much individuals among them may finally want to
   step back from the brink.  They've given the true radicals among them,
   people who actually want default and revolution, too much juice, and
   now the radicals, though still a minority in their ranks, drive their
   train.

   Their side needs to win.  They see brinksmanship and constitutional
   hardball as the only games they can win right now, and they still
   control enough veto points in the system that they can force us into
   those games, so that's what they'll do.  And they're not going to
   relent and let all of us out of their game until one party or the other
   is gone.  The further they push this, the less they will have anything
   left to go back to, and they will have no choice but to push it to its
   conclusion.

   So your poll needs at least two more alternatives:
   1) even more radical
   2) deathmatch radical.

       Any gunplay involved would only come late in the process.  But
       there's a whole lot of numbers between 11 and whatever number you
       want to assign to the first shot at whatever Fort Sumter it'll be
       this time.
       My point is that it's not easy to see how the other side backs off
       its 11, or worse, how they act in a way that gives our side any
       room to let them.  And they can't even stay at 11, because their
       outlook doesn't look good at 11 either.
       What do they do, other than go past 11?  And what do we do, other
       than exploit the weakness of their even staying at 11, much less
       pushing it further?
       Sure, reality is likely to find a way out of any dilemma we imagine
       it has got our world into, by routes we can't imagine.  But the
       other side is so good at closing off escape routes back to common
       sense, that I'm not sure reality will win this one.  Well, it won't
       win in any way that doesn't involve giving all of us one of those
       high human cost educations that reality is so famous for dishing
       out.

   It's minus 18 degrees BELOW ZERO Fahrenheit with wind chill factors
   that make it feel like 25 BELOW ZERO here.

   JEERS to being colder than a witch's tit in January.  The blankie/throw
   is cranked on high.  Guess who's staying in bed today?  I plan on
   staying up long enough to watch Revenge on Hulu, and then will probably
   sleep most of the day.  I don't do cold well, so under a nice warm
   blankie/throw plus double blankets and bedspreads sounds perfect.  The
   fact that the cold outside is radiating inside and making my nose cold
   means my fingers are cold and my whole body stays cold, so I need to
   get nose and fingers warm.

   That is all.

       ... of Minnesota, more or less, but most of the state has temps and
       weather conditions about the same.  The Twin Cities is a few
       degrees warmer, but not enough anyone would notice the difference.
        Once those cold winds start blowing, even slightly, the wind chill
       gets to one pretty fast.
       This is also why we have state laws that outdoor animals have to
       have enclosures/buildings where they can be inside and protected
       from the elements or somehow have a way of getting or staying warm,
       plus they have to have access to food that won't freeze and water

       Perhaps you'd mentioned it before and I half-remembered it.
       Cities do tend to retain a bit more heat, but like you said, in
       some parts of the country, it isn't enough to notice.
       I was in bootcamp in Great Lakes, IL in the middle of winter 1980.
       We didn't do the teargas drill because it would have stuck to our
       skin and clothing. We had liberty for a couple of days toward the
       end of it, so I took the train down to Chicago to hang out and see
       some friends.
       I was impressed that, everywhere I went in uniform, I was not
       allowed to pay for anything except a movie. Someone picked up my
       tab in a restaurant and the ladies in the museum wouldn't let me
       pay admittance.
       Secondly, the wind. My God, the Wind! Felt like someone froze
       sandpaper and scrubbed every exposed square millimeter. I weighed
       close to 250 and the wind was nearly holding me back when I had to
       face into it.

       It isn't known as The Windy City for nothing.  :-)
       Wind from the north or that comes from the direction of a cold lake
       tend to feel colder than the air temperature otherwise.
       I've been to Chicago (briefly) as a kid and drove through it on the
       way to Chanute AFB, IL when my bro was there.
       I also stayed with my aunt & uncle (who were also my godparents) in
       Cudahy, IL in the summers between my high school years and they
       only lived three blocks from Lake Michigan, so I'm a bit familiar
       with it - just not in the winter, altho I've certainly seen a lot
       of info about it in the winter and how cold it is.

   My master's is in higher ed and I've been trying to get into the field
   for 23 years - when I've placed in the top candidates and gone through

   District, and looking for someone to administer the office. I've made
   the first cut - huzzah! With the first round interviews in
   mid-February.  We'll see how it goes.  ::fingers crossed::

   I really needed that bit of good news, especially after being scolded
   for writing an email using "!" in my closing to someone about the
   travel arrangements I was making on their behalf.  Like I said,

   Jeers to me for not being able to post, much less get a picture of Dr.
   Destructo (u know, the CAT).  Everytime I try he senses the camera
   and/or my phone and immediately takes off.  sigh.  Now that he's 8
   months old and a little bigger he's figured out opening the door that
   leads between the first and second floors of the house.  He grabs the
   doorknob with his paws and after jiggling it, hearing the click and
   pushing it with his weight. . . voila open.  The only place I can keep
   him shut up (with food and litterbox) is an upstairs bedroom.  He's
   tried to open that door, too, but can't.  At least right now.  He's
   been able to climb onto the doorknob and tried to use his weight to
   unlatch it.  He's failed.  That doesn't mean he won't keep trying.

   Have a good one, y'all y'all.  Keep warm.  Hug some loved ones.

   Jeers to the woman who has been taking advantage of my 96 year old Mom.
    She has given her a rather large sum of money, ostensibly because she
   has fallen on hard times.  She also talked Mom into selling her her car
   for half of what it is worth,but when we told her she would have to
   present a Certified check she started backing out of the deal.  This
   caused me to get a Criminal background check on her.  She has a couple
   of DWI convictions including one where she was going the wrong way on a
   2 lane road.  The latest was an arraignment for altering
   registration/title or tags (no conviction).  She "borrowed Mom's car a
   couple of weeks ago for 5 days and put about 400 miles on it and left
   it with no gas at all!.

   elderly friends/relatives!

       people - it's one of the most common grifts.
       I think it would be worth it to sign up for one of those background
       check websites if I was needing to hire for in-home help nowadays.
       Cleaning up the financial mess after one of these grifters has
       worked their 'magic' is a huge problem.
       I'm glad you found out now. There may be advice on-line somewhere
       on how to explain it to your mother so she doesn't take it badly. I
       had to be the 'evil daughter-in-law' more than once in the 1990s.
       Something that doesn't make good sense, makes bad sense. That means
       someone is being deliberately hurtful & selfish. Look for motives
       behind actions & words.

   of four years ago and I heartily approve of your message today. This is

     And in other news, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan spent their Sunday
     quietly not being sworn in for anything.  The republic endures.

   Well, actually, I think the "suck it" part is my favorite part.

   Cheers for the long weekend! I was just thinking what it would be like
   if we had a holiday for a conservative like Reagan. We'd probably have
   to work on Saturday with no holiday pay and we wouldn't be allowed to
   work on Sunday even if we needed the hours. Of course, no Monday off!

   you're dieting or plan to, I invite you over. Super cheers? I lost ten

     To the Wall Street banksters, who..... who.....  hell, I can't even
     begin to write the words that describe your obscene, cold-hearted,
     destructive, greedy and soulless behavior over the past four years.
     Just suck it.

   Unfortunately, nothing has changed in practice that I can see. The Wall
   Streeters, the Bankers, the Mortgagers, the Vulture Capitalists are
   still doing pretty much what they did before. When you are too big to
   fail, you are too big to care what the Government says.

   They can all still suck it, as far as I am concerned, but I think the

   all.

   Nicklaus is NOT a classy Republican.  He is not a classy anything
   except golfer.
   He is a rabid anti-semite and bigot.  Trust me.  I live in the
   community, have attended meetings, charity stuff, am Jewish with an
   Irish catholic sounding surname and you would not believe the ugly
   stuff that comes out of his mouth....

       I encountered him at a tournament years ago -a very brief encounter
       - and had an immediate distaste for the man. Nothing he said or did
       - just his aura.
       It's good to confirm that the gut knows what the gut knows.

       Jeez...the more I learn about pro golfers, the more I regret ever
       watching 'em.  Mickelson's rant is pretty classless (or should I
       say "classist"), too.  Tiger's a jerk, Vijay Singh's a jerk...
       etc.  Sad to hear that about Jack.

 I had the same reaction as brook... ([3295]0+ / 0-)
       ... many years ago when I saw said Nicklaus on TV.  Took an instant
       dislike to him for no earthly reason I could fathom except his body
       language was all 'wrong' for whatever he was saying at the time, so
       I kept quiet thinking I had to be wrong because he was in high
       favor at the time.
       Good to know my instincts were/are correct.

   I was meaning to do something like that myself but I was too lazy. But
   at least I can add on a few names:

   Suck it to lefty Richard Cohen of the Washington Post who a year and a
   half ago was chastising Obama with his doom-and-gloom talk about "Obama
   has lost the Hamptons!". Oh, no. And when he wasn't writing about such
   conversations he he had with his elitist Hamptons friends he was
   actually dismissing Obama's ability to be President.

   And George F. Will can suck it too for his thinly veiled racist column
   before the election that Obama was essentially some affirmative action
   President, a man voted to office only because of white guilt and that
   folks are only sticking by him for those very same reasons. Because
   according to Will Obama has been a horrible presence who has never done
   anything. Well, here's to four more years of doing nothing that you are
   happy about, Georgie. Now go find your white sheet.

   And, Joe "You Lie" Wilson, you can suck the big one too. You are
   probably too dumb to realize that your outburst brought shame to South
   Carolina...probably because  the folks in SC celebrated your silly
   stunt.

   We have a new President who is the same one we've had for the past four
   years and the first one I can think of I was really and truly
   enthusiastic about voting for. Twice.

   And CHEERS for that lovely rant, Bill. Now I know why they keep you on
   the front page.

   And more CHEERS for President Obama's terrific inaugural speech.

   And more CHEERS to the memory of MLK, Jr.

   And more CHEERS for a day off that is sunny and mild.

   And still more CHEERS for a fun Saturday dinner the SF Kossacks (and
   special guest Dave in Northridge).

   And now I'm off the gym.

   PS: Yes, the Republicans will stay crazy. They can't help themselves
   and they have an obligation to all of the crazy people who voted them
   in.
