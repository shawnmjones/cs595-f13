[22]For the GOP, all sequestration cuts are conspiracies

   The House Oversight Committee's new attack ad
   Rep. Darrell Issa does not actually know what his job is. That's the
   only possible conclusion you can reach when he's got his House
   Oversight Committee releasing bona fide [30]attack ads against the
   President of the United States.

     Issa released an attack video this morning, presumably paid for with
     our tax dollars, whining once more about the White House tours. The
     message of the attack itself is rather odd -- Issa apparently
     believes the cancelation of tours will give the president more
     leisure time, though that really doesn't make any sense -- and comes
     across as rather desperate, even by House GOP standards.

     But what's especially amazing about this case is Issa's bizarre
     priorities. For reasons I can't understand, the far-right Republican
     is fascinated by White House tours, but seems entirely indifferent
     to the meaningful effects of sequestration in his own congressional
     district.

   The "White House tours" line was an [31]omnipresent [32]one when I
   attended CPAC last week. It's not just Issa, but a whole assortment of
   Republicans and, of course, the conservative base that is positive the
   tour cancellations were done to try to make them look bad to their
   constituents. The other half of the time was spent pooh-poohing the
   supposed effects from sequestration at all; according to the many of
   the speakers, the total effects from sequestration would seem to be the
   cancelation of White House tours and absolutely nothing else. And
   they're livid over it. Donald Trump offered to pay for the resumption
   of the tours (note that he did not, for example, offer to help pay for
   restoring [33]the axed college scholarships for the children of
   soldiers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, because those kids can get
   bent); similar offers have been made by other prominent blowhards, e.g.
   Sean Hannity.

   We've also got sequestration causing closures in [34]national parks,
   [35]Head Start programs, [36]housing assistance for the poor,
   [37]tuition assistance programs for soldiers, and--just in Issa's
   congressional district alone, [38]layoffs and airport closures. That
   was the whole point, after all; sequestration was designed as an
   across-the-board percentage cut with no exceptions or nuance or room
   for judgment as to whether or not the cut things were going to cause
   even greater problems down the line. It was designed to be bad.

   The Republicans, though, have continued to prove themselves
   budget-illiterate throughout this. They just had a whole convention in
   which all parties were quite certain that the cuts would be
   unnoticeable. Their national politicians are fuming at the few specific
   cuts they have noticed, convinced that they couldn't possibly be
   budget-related, but were instead done as just to spite them,
   personally. Like everything else Issa's dealt with, he starts with the
   presumption of conspiracy, and then just goes with it. Yeah, they're
   that dumb, or crooked. (I can't speak for Issa, but as for the base?
   Definitely dumb.)

   I'm sure there's plenty of places in government that we could cut money
   from. For example, it looks like Issa could stand to have his budget
   slashed quite a bit, if he's got the staff busy producing political
   advertisements against a president who isn't going to be running again
   anyway. If the House Oversight Committee wasn't busy making attack
   videos on the taxpayer dime, maybe there'd be some money we could free
   up there for some nice White House tours.

   Something you can do right now: [39]Sign the petition telling the
   Republican National Committee to stop whining about these tours and
   start giving a damn about everything else that the sequester is
   affecting. If we can't educate them, maybe we can at least humiliate
   them into caring about their own constituents.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [57]Tagging tips - [58]Search For Tags - [59]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [60]Civil
   Rights, [61]Community, [62]Congress, [63]Culture, [64]Economy,
   [65]Education, [66]Elections, [67]Energy, [68]Environment, [69]Health
   Care, [70]International, [71]Labor, [72]Law, [73]Media, [74]Meta,
   [75]National Security, [76]Science, [77]Transportation, or [78]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([79]California, [80]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     If we can't educate them, maybe we can at least humiliate them into
     caring about their own constituents.

   Why would they suddenly give a crap about their constituents? They've
   ignored them for 30+ years, why start now?

   Pretty much the only way the Repukes will care about the sequester is
   if you told them it would allow more minorities to "slip thru the
   borders" or that women might be getting abortions without getting
   probed. Hell, even then they won't do anything about it. They'll just
   keep screeching about "Socialism!" and claiming the it's all the
   President's fault.

   Get used to the sequestered form of the US government. This is their
   Grover Norquistian dream come true. There is no way they're going to
   lift a finger or raise one cent of revenue to fix it.

   And I signed it confident that the GOP will refuse to take that advice,
   and probably do the opposite, just because of who's giving the advice.

   It reminds me of a line late in the movie Little Big Man.  Dustin
   Hoffman's character earlier in the move had snuck into General Custer's
   tent planning to kill him, but chickens out.  He stays on as a scout
   for Custer's cavalry, and before riding off to the big defeat Custer
   asks him what's over the hill.  The scout thinks, "This time it wasn't
   a knife I had in my hand to kill him, it was the truth."  He tauntingly
   tells Custer that over the hill are not a bunch of women and children
   to massacre, but thousands of armed braves.  Custer, who knows the
   scout is an Indian sympathizer, figures the scout is lying and rides
   confidently to his defeat and death.

   I think we can taunt the GOP with good advice they won't have the
   wisdom or humility to follow.

   We're all pretty strange one way or another; some of us just hide it
   better. "Normal" is a dryer setting.

 Per contra. It's not stupid politics to gripe ... ([414]0+ / 0-)

   ... about things the public can visualize so readily. Shutting down
   tours of the White House around Easter season is a pretty obvious and
   vivid example ... of something, but not of the sequester.

   Forgive me folks, but I think this particular decision was a stupid one
   by whoever made it. It comes across as an
   in-your-face/we-told-you-it-would-hurt move that hurts tourists to
   Washington, DC, at a peak and favorite time to travel. It resonates
   with anyone who has been to DC, who'll be going there in the near
   future, or who wants to go.

   It looks small, peevish and mean spirited. And it certainly does not
   look like something that had to happen in the first days of the
   sequester.

   Actually, it's laughable because in previous "shutdowns", they used to
   close access to the Washington Monument. That was derided then as a
   ridiculous but very prominent example of a dumb decision (the shutdown,
   in that case). This time, the GOP will play it as the administration's
   own dumb decision, inflicted by an obstructive President, and they'll
   pledge to keep Congress open and accessible as usual. (That'll be

       We could have the sequester with us for a long time. (See Senate

       whenever a constituent stands up at a town meeting or makes a call
       to the office, the Republican Senator or Representative will blame
       everyone in the known universe but themselves. They didn't design
       it. They wouldn't have done it this way. Why, they didn't want this
       way. It was the President's idea. Etc.
       The White House will have to be much smarter than this decision
       indicates about how it explains what will be a series of obvious
       and very painful announcements. The Executive branch will be out
       there all alone smacking down the public, government employees and
       programs. The GOP will just push back with the SOS. The sequester
       itself may be automatic, but the choice of what, when, how and who
       to announce cannot be. That better be direct, simple and

       Especially when cancelling the tours not only preserves critical
