   Greg Abbott, the Republican Attorney General of Texas, [281]issued a
   stern warning this week to members of an international delegation
   expected to be on hand to monitor voting at polling places around the
   country on Election Day.

   In a [282]letter to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
   Europe, which works to ensure the integrity of elections, [283]among
   other tasks, Abbott warned the diplomatic poll-watchers that their
   involvement in U.S. elections could have strong legal repercussions.

   "It may be a criminal offense for OSCE's representatives to maintain a
   presence within 100 feet of a polling place's entrance," he writes.
   "Failure to comply with these requirements could subject the OSCE's
   representatives to criminal prosecution for violating state law." Such
   a restriction makes election monitoring highly difficult.

   The OSCE [284]announced earlier this month that it would send 44
   observers to polling places around the country on Election Day in order
   to monitor possible disputes that could arise in the voting process.
   The move came in response to a petition from liberal-leaning voting
   rights groups, including the NAACP and ACLU, that suggested the OSCE's
   presence could help combat what they fear will be a concerted effort to
   suppress votes from supporters of President Barack Obama.

   Concerns among Democrats have mounted in the wake of reports that
   right-leaning groups, such as the [285]Tea Party-aligned True The Vote,
   had plans to dispatch armies of poll-watchers seeking to root out
   invalid votes. Opponents warn that the volunteer "poll challengers"
   will engage in intimidation of legitimate minority voters who tend to
   vote Democratic.

   In his letter, Abbott takes issue with the OSCE's supposed opposition
   to voter ID laws, which won't be in place in Texas after being
   [286]rejected by a federal court, and adds that the group's efforts at
   polling places are neither needed nor acceptable.

   "If OSCE members want to learn more about our election processes so
   they can improve their own democratic systems, we welcome the
   opportunity to discuss the measures Texas has implemented to protect
   the integrity of elections," he writes. "However, groups and
   individuals from outside the United States are not allowed to influence
   or interfere with the election process in Texas. This State has robust
   election laws that were carefully crafted to protect the integrity of
   our election system. All persons -- including persons connected with
   OSCE -- are required to comply with these laws."

   Abbott's opposition is consistent with a growing trend of conservative
   distrust toward the United Nations and other international
   organizations. On Tuesday, Florida GOP Senate candidate [287]Connie
   Mack said that the U.N. should be defunded and "kicked off of American
   soil." In a statement, Mack [288]appeared to suggest that the broader
   U.N., and therefore presumably the OSCE as well, was driven by
   nefarious motives.

   "The very idea that the United Nations -- the world body dedicated to
   diminishing America's role in the world -- would be allowed, if not
   encouraged, to install foreigners sympathetic to the likes of Castro,
   Chavez, Ahmadinejad and Putin to oversee our elections is nothing short
   of disgusting," he said.

   UPDATE: 3:10 p.m. EST -- Ambassador Janez Lenarcic, director of the
   OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR),
   [289]responded in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
   saying that Abbott's threat put the state of Texas at odds with an
   agreement between the body and state authorities.

   "The threat of criminal sanctions against OSCE/ODIHR observers is
   unacceptable," Lenarcic said. "The United States, like all countries in
   the OSCE, has an obligation to invite ODIHR observers to observe its
   elections."

   Lenarcic took issue with insinuations that officials in the group would
   meddle with elections, reiterating that they were bound by national
   laws and regulations, as well as their own strict code of conduct.

   "Our observers are required to remain strictly impartial and not to
   intervene in the voting process in any way," Lenarcic said. "They are
   in the United States to observe these elections, not to interfere in
   them."

   A release relaying Lenarcic's comments pointed out that the OSCE has
   observed five previous U.S. elections since 2002, all without incident.

   CORRECTION: This article originally reported that the OSCE was created
   by the United Nations. While the OSCE and UN [290]partner on some
   operations, they are independent organizations.

     * Obama Is Not An American Citizen
       One of the most popular Obama conspiracy theories (aka the Birther

       Cheney</a>, it claims that Obama is not an American citizen, thus
       rendering his presidency illegitimate, or something. The theory
       hinges on the false claim that his birth certificate is fake.

     * Obama Wants "Re-Education Camps For Young People
       Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), a proponent of many bizarre and
       outlandish critiques of President Obama, declared in April that the
       White House was trying to install <a
       href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/06/bachmann-obama-wants
       -re-e_n_183552.html">youth re-education camps</a>. "It's under the
       guise of -- quote -- volunteerism. But it's not volunteers at all.
       It's paying people to do work on behalf of government," said the
       Minnesota Republican. "I believe that there is a very strong chance
       that we will see that young people will be put into mandatory
       service. And the real concerns is that there are provisions for
       what I would call re-education camps for young people, where young
       people have to go and get trained in a philosophy that the
       government puts forward and then they have to go to work in some of
       these politically correct forums."
     * Larry Sinclair's Rabbit Hole Of Insanity
       This one is a doozy. Larry Sinclair, <a
       href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/11164.html">a petty
       criminal specializing in forgery</a>, spread wild accusations via
       YouTube involving <a

       sincl_n_107900.html">gay sex, drugs and possible murder committed
       by Barack Obama</a>. At one point reporters apparently took
       Sinclair seriously enough to attend a press conference he gave,
       most remarkable for his lawyer's appearance in a kilt, which he
       explained was intended to secure comfort for his unusually large
       sexual organs: "Those at the other end of the spectrum find [pants]
       quite confining."
     * The Case Of The Fake Thesis
       In which a group of right-wingers get taken in by a satiric blog
       post on Barack Obama's college thesis, written ages ago, and
       frantically presented as real. The post, which was tagged as
       SATIRE, described how <em>Time</em> Magazine's Joe Klein had
       obtained ten pages of a thesis written by Barack Obama, in which he
       wrote about how the Constitution was "inherently flawed." Then Rush
       Limbaugh and Michael Ledeen presented this story as <a
       href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/23/fake-obama-thesis-st
       ory-g_n_332255.html">fact</a>.
     * Bill Ayers Wrote 'Dreams From My Father"
       A popular theory on right-wing websites like <a
       href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/2101151/posts">The
       Free Republic</a>, <a
       href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/10/who_wrote_dreams_from_
       my_fathe_1.html">American Thinker</a> and <a
       href="http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=110784">WorldNetDaily</a>,
       claiming that educator (and former radical) Bill Ayers helped Obama
       write "Dreams Of My Father." There is <a
       href="http://www.obamaconspiracy.org/category/books/">no
       evidence</a> supporting this claim.
     * Obama As Antichrist
       Is Obama the Antichrist? <a
       href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDB5BFoSQLs&feature=player_emb
       edded">These</a> <a
       href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/antichrist.asp">folks</a
       > think maybe so. McCain also verged on endorsing this theory
       during the campaign season with an attack ad called "<a
       href="http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1830590,00.h
       tml">The One.</a>"
     * Obama As Muslim
       A theory that began circulating during the campaign season and has
       been kept alive by Tea Partiers, and other ultra-conservatives.
       It's taken different forms over the year (<a
       href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/6516016/Will-Obama-Swearin-on-the-H
       oly-Koran-or-the-Holy-Bible-After-Attacking-Jesus-Sermon-on-the-Mou
       nt">Will Obama be sworn into office on Qur'an??</a>, asks one
       website.) Most recently Tea Party leader Mark Williams had a
       meltdown on CNN, and <a
       href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/15/tea-party-leader-mel
       ts-do_n_286933.html">claimed</a> that Obama was an "Indonesian
       Muslim" and a "welfare thug." According to Obama and those who know
       him, this is not so.
     * Tells America In His Acceptance Speech To "Serve Satan"
       Ever listened to Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" backwards? How
       about Obama's presidential acceptance speech? This video suggests
       that the speech, like the Zeppelin song, contains a Satanic message
       when played in reverse. Go ahead - take a bong hit, try it and tell
       us what you hear.
     * Hugo Chavez Funded The Obama Campaign
       Did Hugo Chavez fund the Obama campaign? No. But some people
       thought so after a Fox News affiliate issued a false report
       claiming that <a
       href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/chavez.asp">he did</a>.
     * Michelle Banished Barack's Girlfriend To The Caribbean
       One of the few conspiracy theories to go after the Obamas'
       marriage. The claim is that Michelle banished Barack's female aide
       (and suspected lover) to the Caribbean. Every person involved,
       including the woman, says this is <a
       href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1076695/Oba
       ma-hit-affair-smears-following-claims-attractive-aide-banned-wife.h
       tml">false</a>.
     * Obama Is Malcolm X's Son
       Initiated by the author of the <a
       href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2008/10/how-c
       ould-stanl.html">Atlas Shrugged</a> blog and claiming that Obama is
       actually Malcolm X's son. As Ezra Klein <a
       href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=10
       &year=2008&base_name=obama_x">pointed out</a> at the time:
       "Honestly, who wouldn't give Malcolm props for that one?" Klein
       continued: "And think there's anyway we can fit Tupac into the
       bloodline? Or maybe Obama actually is Tupac? You know that whole
       shooting was some bullshit, right? Incidentally, I see no reason to
       stop with Malcolm. History is full of great Xs for Barack Obama to
       be related to. Professor X, which would explain why millions of
       white people lose their minds in his presence. Weapon X, which
       would explain the adamantium grafted onto his skeleton. XML, which
       would explain why it's so easy to structure his data. I'm sure
       there are others."

   Does this AG know what diplomatic immunity is? These UN observers would
   probably be holding diplomatic passports. The most I think he could
   achieve is to have them removed from the voting location.
   Of course that will only make it look as though something was going on
   which election organizers don't want seen by outside observers.
   I had to laugh at the AG's comment that he would be [323] Read More...
   willing to teach them US electoral methods.
   There is no end of this fixation on the myth that we do everything
   better than everyone else.
   Almost ALL foreign nations do NOT have a political system similar to
   our Constitution. And that is not about to change. They use a
   Parliamentary system, which is much more functional than our system,
   which is really showing its age, and we are rapidly approaching the
   point where we will have permanent gridlock, and vital issues will be
   ignored.

   There is nothing innocent about what the UN and other international
   socialist organizations are trying to do. They are trying gradually
   trying to intrude international law over US sovereignty. This goes
   along with the recent UN treaties that attempt to override AMerican Law
   in the areas of Gun Control, environment, and others. This is part of
   Obama's plan to globalize America. Only the States can stop him now.

   Is anyone really surprised by this? If the GOP is so concerned about
   democratic voter fraud like they claim they should welcome this.
   Why not have an unbiased observer to prove to the world how democracy
   works.
   Yet they claim to the rest of the world that they care about democratic
   reform in Iraq and Iran.
   What does the rest of the world think when they see this? Are the
   Iranians supposed to believe they care about democracy in Iran and the
   Middle East when they actively undermine it at home?
   Do they think the rest of the world is so stupid not to notice?
   They can hide behind Jesus and wrap themselves in the flag all they
   want but eventually the truth comes out.

   So the Democrats believe conservative vote observers will intimidate
   voters? They would only be able to intimidate those voting twice,
   voting while dead, or otherwise comitting fraud. Why should the
   Democrats be concerned over that? And why weren't they concerned when
   the New Black Panther party hoodlums guarded the voting places in
   Philadelphia last election, using military uniforms and billy-clubs to
   threaten and intimidate voters? The UN has no legitimate business in
   American affairs. It is time to get the US out of the UN and the UN out
   of the US.

   When a presidential candidate has gotten close to $1 billion from
   far-right reactionaries who openly admit they want to buy the
   government, and his own son buys many of the voting machines that will
   be tabulating the votes, AND his party seeks to disenfranchise as many

   The UN lost its way a long time ago. What it stands for today is
   nefarious at best. Like most governments (and the UN is a government of
   its own by its own that the USA financially supports with our tax
   dollars) the need to find work for itself and thus a reason for being
   is absolute. Hence yet another program of dubious results funded by
   guess who???
   Abbots stand seems reasonable to me. AND I am sure he would not
   tolerate the Black Panthers, the NAACP or any other hate group from
   "overseeing the electoral process" as happened in the last election. By
   the way, seems to me that the latter groups also drive the hate
   campaigns to bring in money, to incite riots,and the list goes on and
   on.
   Utopia might be taking money out off all equations, working together
   with honest motives to have peaceful communities, restoring the
   Constitution, doing away with all entitlement programs in an effort to
   re-instate a work ethic in the USA, and stopping the killing of
   innocents with the drone program.

   The way I understand it is that the states that the OSCE were
   monitoring were not given previous notification in 2004 and 2008. It
   was not until a watchdog filed a FOIA that it was divulged that OSCE
   had every intention of monitoring this years election and had others.
   Perhaps the Acorn debacle along with the Black Panthers 'monitoring
   ie.intimidating' voters in the last election caused the FOIA to be
   filed in the first place and also the very reason that the States want
   the election process to not be disrupted in any way..

   Case in point: I just recently voted early however not before poll
   workers checked my Texas Driver's Licence photo ID. I didn't have a
   current voter's registration card because I misplaced my nenewed one at
   home. I also have a current military ID card. They thought that I would
   just walk away in disgust. A retired Marine??? Are you kidding??? I
   walked across the hall to the County Elections Office and explained the
   matter to the Administrator of Elections. She took my Driver's Licence
   and brought me up on the computer. She located my voter registration
   card number and sent me back over to vote. This happened in Waco,Texas.
   So, what is Abbot hiding??? Voter intimidation maybe. The GOP here in
   Texas are such chickenchits...lol!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   Wesley, did they refuse to allow you to vote without showing your
   Registration card? I vote all the time using my Texas DL. The current
   law states that you must have some form of identification. That
   includes utility bills with your name and address, state DL or ID card,
   voter registration card, birth certificate, passport, and a few others.
   I would think military ID would be included in that. If you couldn't
   produce any of these things, and your name is on the list of registered
   voters, you can execute a provisional ballot. Unless you were
   specifically told that none of these things could be used in lieu of
   your current voter registration card, I really don't understand your
   beef. How else would you suggest we protect the integrity of our "one
   man, one vote" system? I have never, ever had a problem when voting,
   and I am one of those nutty people who votes in every, single election.

   I presented my valid Texas DL but they said it wasn't good enough,
   however a worker led me across the hall to the Elections Administrator
   and she looked me up and cleared me. Point is what if they just refused
   to help me or others???

   "True the Vote and the King Street Patriots Get Caught With Their Pants
   Down - Confirm They Are Only Concerned With One Kind of "Voter Fraud"
   Fort Bend Texas - Attached, you can see proof that the Republican
   candidate for County Commissioner in Fort Bend County voted in the
   general elections in both Texas and Pennsylvania in 2006, 2008, and
   2010. In all three cases, he voted by mail in Pennsylvania and then
   fraudulently voted in person in Texas.
   Bruce J. Fleming of Sugar Land, age 60, is the Republican nominee for
   County Commissioner in Precinct 1 in Fort Bend County. His financial
   disclosure records show that he owns a homesteaded property in Bucks
   County, Pennsylvania, along with his homesteaded property in Sugar
   Land, Texas. Records from Bucks County show that a Bruce J Fleming with
   the same birth date and property address as the Bruce Fleming in Fort
   Bend County voted in Bucks County in the last three general elections
   with a mail ballot. He also voted in person in Fort Bend County in
   those same three elections.
   Bruce Fleming is running against Fort Bend County Democratic incumbent
   county commissioner Richard Morrison. Fleming remains on the voter
   rolls in Pennsylvania although he registered in Texas in July of 2006.
   It also appears that Fleming's wife, Nancy, voted in both elections in
   2010......

   Doesn't it just beg the questions: What have you got to hide? What's
   wrong with independent, objective observation in anyplace in the US on
   election day?
   We respect their presence and observations in the past in the US and
   around the world, but "suddenly" not by the GOP and certainly not in
   Texas. Frankly, between the confusion over Voter ID laws, I think
   independent, objective observation is definitely in order this year
   more than any since George W vs. Gore in 2000 when one candidate's
   brother was the Governor of the state with the disputed ballot counting
   in a very close election.
   Remember what President Reagan said: "Trust, but verify."

   Progressives have been harping on the fact that the voter ID laws are
   unnecessary because there are no actual fraud has occurred. So using
   that reasoning, no voter suppression has occurred either, except for
   the case invented in the monds of the left. Calling for observers is
   just a way to cover the impending loss of Obama in this election.
   Progressives refuse to believe the country could actually decide to
   elect Romney instead of Obama. What is so funny about this story is
   obvious loathing and anger so many on the left carry for the state of
   Texas. The reason UN observers are being told to stay out is simple, we
   only tolerate Yankees because we have to, but we surely dont have to
   tolerate any interlopers from the UN. The funny thing about all of this
   is so many people on the left in other states actually think we Texans
   really care about what you say or think about us. Newflash,,, we don't.
   Never have , never will. American by birth, Texan by the grace of
   God.....

   Those are the kinds of comments that make Texas look bad...I'm a 5th
   generation Texan and can say those comments do not reflect on the
   majority of Texans.
   At least those that I associate with are intelligent caring people.
   News Flash - A vast amount of people in Texas now are "Yankees" that
   moved here over the last 30 years.
   Do you not even realize that the Bush administration invited the OSCE
   for the 2004 and 2008 Presidential election? This isn't an "Obama
   issue"....educate yourself please.
   By the way, the USA has been a participating member in the OSCE since
   1973...

   Your reasoning is only "accurate" if one accepts your equivocation over
   the term "voter suppression." Nobody disputes that voter fraud occurs;
   what they dispute is that it occurs in any significant number to
   justify mass disenfranchisement of voters.
   Voter suppression, however, does occur. The long list of laws
   proposed/passed in the recently primarily by the GOP is part of that
   problem. Voter suppression has never meant simply "physical
   suppression," at least not by any legal definition. Thus, the 1965 VRA
   exists to protect such instances as physical and psychological
   (discouragement by making the voting process unnecessarily difficult)
   in instances where such practices disproportionately affect those of
   color.
   So not only do you present as your argument an equivocation, which is a
   logical fallacy, but you also present an equivocation that is
   demonstrably false.
   Romney could win the election; that becomes even more likely when
   voters are stripped of their right to vote. The concern isn't that the
   left doesn't want Romney to win, but that the right would be so bold as
   to openly institute policies that would effectively steal an election.
   After all, there is no evidence that Obama will be supported by massive
   amounts of voter fraud; there is, however, evidence that Romney will be
   supported by voter disenfranchisement, since the groups who are
   disproportionately affected by such laws are also groups which
   disproportionately vote Democratic.
