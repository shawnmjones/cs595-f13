A Q&A with Ghana's Vaccine King

   [45]John Murphy
   April 16, 2013

   [46]Dr. K.O. Antwi-Agyei manages the Expanded Programme on Immunisation
   in Ghana, where he oversees the day-to-day work to ensure vaccines
   reach children across the country.

   Ghana's health care system has put a lot of its resources into
   vaccines. Why?

   We can see a lot of achievements in reducing child deaths by investing
   in delivering vaccines. The returns are high, so the politicians and
   policy makers are convinced that it's worth investing in vaccines. That
   is why at least every year within our budget we ensure that we pay for
   all our traditional vaccines.

   Our communities have also been great because they embrace vaccination.
   They even testify that "Oh, our children used to die from measles. Now
   with vaccination, we don't see measles." And of course, they allow our
   staff into their homes. There is trust. We can now return to the
   communities with other vaccination campaigns. It's marvelous.

   What impact have vaccines had on the health of Ghana's population?

   Around 1974, immunization coverage was around 1.6 percent. Today, well
   over 90 percent of our population is covered by immunization services,
   reducing the burden of disease.

   For example, measles used to be the number two killer of children. Now
   it's no longer a cause of death for the past 10 years in Ghana.  So a
   lot has been achieved through immunizations.

   Last year, you were the first immunization chief in Africa to
   simultaneously roll out two vaccines, one protecting children against
   pneumonia and the other against rotavirus.  Why did you decide to do
   that and, and what was the
   result?

   Our desire to reach the Millennium Development Goal to reduce childhood
   death was a very big motivating factor. Apart from malaria, pneumonia
   and diarrhea are the two highest killing diseases. So we thought, if
   there is no vaccine against malaria now, and there are vaccines against
   pneumonia and diarrhea, then it's worth fighting. So we decided to
   fight the two together. We thought it would be difficult, but not an
   impossibility. And with careful planning, we could succeed.

   How important are Ghana's [47]community health workers in delivering
   the vaccines?

   They are very important. The front line health workers, they are in
   touch with the communities. They help improve our public health
   services, not only through vaccinations but also by treating minor
   illnesses offering family planning and providing other health-related
   services.

   How does Ghana use data collection to improve immunization coverage?

   Data is used for making decisions. If your data is not good, then of
   course your decisions will also be faulty, and you won't be able to
   achieve your objectives. So a lot of effort has gone into data
   reporting. We developed tally and register books for the basic level so
   that they are able to pick the necessary data on children vaccinated,
   and also on what vaccines have been used. We firmly believe that if you
   won't use the data, then don't collect it. So once we collect the data,
   we use it. If a region's coverage is low, we immediately ask, "What is
   happening there?" We go and investigate and then give us feedback.
   Then, whatever the error is, we discuss it and correct it.

   What is your long term goal for Ghana's immunization program?

   To reach the top is difficult, but to remain at the top is even more
   difficult. For Ghana, our goal is to remain as a leader in the area of
   immunization and to show our commitment and to develop initiatives
   which can spread to other areas. Whatever is happening in other
   countries has a bearing on us. We want to have success stories which
   can be shared so that together we can get rid of diseases which are
   killing our children and mothers.
