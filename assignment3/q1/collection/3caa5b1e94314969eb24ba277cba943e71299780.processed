[24]Pretending that whole unpleasant Richard Mourdock thing never happened

   U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) speaks to the press following his
   private meeting with United States U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice about the
   attack on U.S. diplomats in Benghazi, Libya, on Capitol Hill in
   Washington, November 27, 2012. &nbsp; REUTERS/Jason Ree
   South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, try as he might, just can't get
   crazy enough for the teabaggers.
   [30]Heh.

     Kibbe says FreedomWorks is also looking to make gains for Tea Party
     candidates in Arkansas and Alaska come 2014 and says he's not
     concerned about protecting Republican incumbents--as Republican
     strategist Karl Rove has advocated in some cases--if they don't
     represent Tea Party interests.

     "Maybe it's good if you're a sitting senator, but it's not good for
     the Republican Party and it's certainly not good for public policy,"
     [FreedomWorks President Matt] Kibbe says.

     When asked about cases when a Tea Party candidates beats out an
     incumbent in the primary but then loses in the general election,
     Kibbe says: "Generally, I don't think that's true. If you can't win
     a primary, the supposition that you can win the general is pretty
     questionable. Competition is better."

   FreedomWorks was the first "serious" outfit to back Richard Mourdock's
   primary bid in Indiana, at a time when incumbent Sen. Dick Lugar had
   commanding general-election leads. But let's pretend that never
   happened.

   Then there was Lisa Murkowski's primary loss in 2010. FreedomWorks was
   [31]all over that race as well, supporting conservative nutbag Joe
   Miller. Then Murkowski won the general. With a write-in campaign. Let's
   also pretend that never happened.

   I guess there was the ouster of Utah Sen. Bob Bennett at the state
   party convention in 2010, that replaced a 100 percent conservative
   with, uh, another 100 percent conservative (Mike Lee). I'm sure that
   was pretty exciting for them, regardless. And of course, Georgia Sen.
   Saxby Chambliss was scared into retirement at the mere thought of a
   challenge.

   So now they're targeting South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has
   spent all year trying to win the hearts and minds of teabaggers
   everywhere by filibustering Chuck Hagel. Because of Benghazi. And still
   the love is unrequited! And they can do so, clear conscience, because
   that whole unpleasant Mourdock thing never happened.

   Meanwhile, Democrats have a bona fide pickup opportunity in a changing
   Georgia, while South Carolina threatens to become the Indiana of 2014.
   For a cycle bereft of Democratic Senate pickup opportunities, Democrats
   will gladly take the help.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [53]Tagging tips - [54]Search For Tags - [55]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       are lazy beyond belief.  Plus, they are far too concerned with
       keeping up their appearances of "seriousness" and "impartiality."
       They won't lift even a finger to a keyboard and do a basic search
       for the consequences and effects of events that happened mere weeks
       before.  The whole notion of "in-depth" news reporting currently
       involves nothing more than traveling to a celebrity's rehab
       facility and asking what is on the breakfast menu.
       Elections might have consequences, but the MSM will not cover what
       those consequences are unless they happen in their own driveway and
       they run over them with their own car on their way to the next
       staged media event.

       I understand it's valuable to control the senate, but how many
       times can we expect an elected SC dem to stand with the party on
       key issues? I'd rather have Joe O'Donnell and McCaskill than
       Mourdock and Aiken, but I fully expect them to work behind the
       scenes to sabotage or at least weaken truly helpful legislation,
       and champion positions that are anathema to the liberal base.
       Just sayin', i don't see conservadem victories as anything more
       than something election wonks can get excited about. From a policy
       standpoint, the gain IMO will be negligible. Kinda like what we
       gain from pro-gun deficit hawk Heidi Heitkamp.

   And if so should we? IMHO the teapartiers have managed to keep the
   Overton slammed towards the right since 2010. I personally would rather
   have Blue Dogs and control the House than not but if center-right Obama
   is as far left as the conversation is allowed to get then the more
   rational of the FDR-ists out there don't get heard at all.

   Is voting too tribal to attempt to build a national progressive
   coallition right now? Obama and the centrists did immeasurable damage
   by botching 2010 and the redistricting. Eventually the right wing
   majority will age out and we'll redistrict again but "in the long run
   we're all dead".

   Is it possible to go after state houses before the right wing voting
   block ages out more? My personal opinion, today at least, is to get
   electable candidates period in 2014 and continue to try and build
   sanity at state and local levels. But, as any sports fan will proclaim,
   if you play not to lose ...
   So I'm thinking play long shot offense and prevent everywhere else. And
   here's a long shot: [316]www.andrewhounshell.com/. If we can force
   anything in this district then a lot is on the table. But it's a
   loooong shot no doubt.

   If you didn't like the news today, go out and make some of your own.

       Having sat through the Freedomworks Forum here in our Congressional
       election and participated in the Occupy Charleston events, I can
       assure you that money makes a huge difference.  The Koch brothers
       fund an entire universe of right wing organizations here, feeding
       in money and training.  I saw a lobby full, each with impressive
       literature, table setups and signage which was clearly some sort of
       contract package.  Democrats show up with hand lettered poster
       paper and photocopies.  Occupy wouldn't even get that organized.

   Graham managed to say something neutral about the president when he
   complained about the "paranoia" of Rand Paul's filibuster. Off with his

     I think it's paranoia between libertarians and the hard left that is

   sometimes people get competitive when they describe the awful details

   the Can-You-Bottom-This? effect.

   When it comes to policy proposals and other aberrant acting out, the
   Tea Party forces Republican senators into a game of Can You Bottom

   Lindsey would be more at peace if he stepped off the stage - he spends
   an awful lot of time pretending he's something he's not, and I am
   strictly talking about politics. His "tough guy" talk is so inauthentic
   and he seems completely ill at ease when he spouts bat shit crazy right
   wing talking points. Too scared to be away from his seemingly only
   friend McCain & no identity outside of "Senator Graham" - I am so glad

   Senator Graham is unlikely to survive the primary here.  He's not
   conservative enough, whatever that now means in South Carolina.  The
   millions of dollars in right wing money poured into the state by
   Freedom works and similar organizations has filled the political ocean
   here with right wing sharks.  With the Democrats cleared from
   everything but utterly safe districts, these tea party sharks have
   nothing but their own senior leadership to feed on.
