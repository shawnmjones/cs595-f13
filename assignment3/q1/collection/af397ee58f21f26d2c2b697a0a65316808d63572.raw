<div class="cnnBlogContentPost">
<p><em><a href="http://www.details.com/" target="_blank">Details.com</a> editor James Oliver Cury tackles controversial food-and-drink-themed <a href="http://eatocracy.cnn.com/tag/james-oliver-cury-special-to-eatocracy/" target="_blank">etiquette issues</a>.</em></p>
<p>Which industry has the most egregious surcharges? Airlines have added some surprisingly sneaky fees over the years and were recently in the news again for <a href="http://travel.cnn.com/airline-fat-tax-should-heavy-passengers-pay-more-619046" target="_blank">considering charging extra for overweight people</a>. One airline, Ryanair, seems to take pride in its fees and even contemplated adding <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/04/07/ryanair.lavatory.fee/index.htm" target="_blank">a cost to use the bathroom</a>. Not that hotels have been kind; $8 water bottles and $40 parking spots are as common as charging for Wi-Fi. But restaurants and bars, in my estimation, have developed the most crafty ways to squeeze profit out of that which was once - and should still be - gratis.</p>
<p>I made a list of every “extra” charge I’ve ever heard of (16 examples came to mind and I’m sure there are more) and separated them into two categories: those that seem warranted (like charging for shaved truffles on an entrée) and those that seem brazenly unnecessary and unfair (like charging extra for ketchup).</p>
<p>Below is my definitive list of potential offenses with reasoned assessments of the fairness quotient of each, based purely on personal opinion.<br />
<span id="more-88785"></span><br />
<strong>Extra Charges I Just Don&#039;t Get</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Steak sauce/butters</em></strong><br />
The first time I ate at <a href="http://www.dylanprime.com/html/menus.html" target="_blank">Dylan Prime Steakhouse</a> in New York I was floored to see that a meal - which could easily cost more than $100 a person - might also include a $3 extra charge for a sauce or special butter. That’s like charging extra for sprinkling Parmesan on your pizza. Or having salt on the table. The eatery has seen troubled times recently so there’s no telling if the menu will retain the practice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ketchup</em></strong><br />
Yes, some fast food joints charge extra for a packet of ketchup. I came face to face with this practice at a McDonald’s in London back in 1988. The cost: 5p (pence) - about a nickel - per packet. The idea has since crossed the pond, where U.S. franchise owners decide <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130514/new-york-city/want-ketchup-with-that-mcdonalds-squeezes-extra-fee-from-manhattan-diners" target="_blank">how they’ll dole out condiments</a> (in <a href="http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2012/01/12/why-your-grandma-steals-sugar-packets/" target="_blank">packets</a>, via spigots with paper containers, for a fee or not.). The current cost stateside seems to be 25 cents for a handful of packets. And though it might cut down on waste, it seems random; why aren’t there similar surcharges for mustard and mayo?</p>
<p><strong><em>Splitting a dish/extra side dish</em></strong><br />
If an entrée costs $15 and you use your fork to give your spouse several bites, no one charges you extra. Ask if you can officially split the dish and you may get hit with a surcharge of between $2 and $5 or more, a penalty that feels like it’s designed to discourage sharing (which is weird because don’t we go to restaurants to share a meal with others?) That said, if the request requires time and effort from a server to literally divide the dish and garnishes, then a separate fee seems warranted. If just a side plate is requested, it ought to be free (please don’t suggest that the effort of washing the extra plate necessitates the fee).</p>
<p><strong><em>Splitting the check</em></strong><br />
I was a waiter once. I know it takes more time to process two, three, even four credit cards. But there’s no <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/2011/10/restaurants-now-charging-2-00-to-split-the-check/" target="_blank">good reason to charge extra</a> - <a href="http://russellwhite.com/customer-service/what-do-you-mean-you-won’t-split-the-check/" target="_blank">or forbid</a> - the practice. Credit-card processing fees should not be the customers’ concern.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cocktail neat/on the rocks</em></strong><br />
Some bars tack on an extra buck or two claiming that the pour is different: You get 2 ounces in a neat rocks glass and 1.5 ounces if you order on the rocks. Or vice versa, depending on the place (see <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-08/beware-the-next-nefarious-up-charge-whiskey-neat" target="_blank">this description of a recent bourbon order</a>). Can’t the bartender find some glasses that render these pouring differences less marked or just suck up the difference…or figure it all evens out eventually anyway? Or just charge more in general for the cocktail? Why complicate things?</p>
<p><strong><em>Food waste/not finishing what&#039;s on the plate</em></strong><br />
Buffets are magnets for gluttons because you can pile on as much food as the plate will hold - and sometimes come back for seconds. But there’s a cost: Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs and tons of food typically remains on the plate at the end of the meal. To combat this effect, some restaurants have suggested applying a fee, as reported about the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2145387/Restaurant-fines-diners-Chinese-buffet-leaving-food-plates.html" target="_blank">$32 waste fee posted by the management</a> at The Kylin Buffet Chinese restaurant in England. A noble idea, perhaps, but restaurants are not government institutions (“Take all you want but eat all you take” as they say in the army), and honestly, there are a million reasons why someone wouldn’t finish every morsel. Someone wants to monetize this? See also Hachikyo, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/hachikyo-restaurant-japan-fines-salmon-roe_n_2689573.html" target="_blank">a seafood restaurant in Japan</a> that requires customers who do not finish their bowl of tsukko meshi (rice topped with salmon roe) to make a donation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Non-bottled (sometimes filtered) tap water</em></strong><br />
Millennium restaurant in San Francisco had its heart in the right place: They were dedicated to organic food production, small farms, sustainable agriculture, recycling and composting. In fact, they were so environmentally-friendly that they took the extreme measure of banning bottled water altogether, offering instead <a href="http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2009/05/11/a-new-trend-restaurants-charging-for-water/" target="_blank">a delicious glass from their Natural Tap Water Filtration System</a>. Unfortunately, they also stopped offering tap water. So, water cost $1 for what’s basically filtered tap water. Bobo, in New York, was also taken to task for <a href="http://gothamist.com/2009/04/28/charitable_tap_water_charge_angers.php" target="_blank">what is effectively water gouging with a conscience</a>. Even <a href="http://www.consumertraveler.com/today/a-tap-water-fee-at-mcdonalds-some-franchises-are-lovin-it/" target="_blank">a few McDonald’s</a> (them again?) got in on the action. I say: Allow the public to have a free glass of water, if only so boozers can work in a little hydration without penalty.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sliced bagels</em></strong><br />
In New York there’s an <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/03/31/odd-state-tax-laws/1951911/" target="_blank">8% tax on “altered” bagels</a>: Sliced, toasted or served with schmear. Why the distinction? The cutting and spreading, though a minimal culinary effort to be sure, technically makes it a prepared meal. Sold unaltered, it is a tax-exempt food item. Seems like there’s a hole in this law to me.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Charges I Understand</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Gourmet ingredients</em></strong><br />
You want freshly shaved black truffles on your butter-poached lobster? That’ll be an additional $12 at <a href="http://michaelsonthehill.com/spring-menu.html" target="_blank">Michael’s on the Hill</a> in Vermont (fair price it seems to me). Caviar on the side? Of course you gotta pay extra for that. Nothing fishy there. These are gourmet ingredients, so unless the menu hides the fact that there’s a surcharge, these are warranted. (Years ago, I once ordered a “special” soup at a Chinese restaurant - I don’t recall if it was turtle or sharkfin, neither of which I’d order today - and the server neglected to mention that it cost $40. I’ve been wary of unfamiliar delicacies ever since.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Bread and butter/chips and salsa</em></strong><br />
Historically, Americans in the latter part of the 20th century are accustomed to seeing certain side dishes served for free before a meal. Most consumers simply won’t go back to an establishment if they’re charged for something they used to get (or can get elsewhere) for free. But really, why are these dishes free? The ingredients cost money - and they fill you up, so you may order less. And yet it caused quite a stir when the Post reported that <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_yq00JG9MNJpXmJXWlUUfxN;j" target="_blank">Chelsea restaurant Company</a> charged “$3 for bread and another $2 for butter” a few years back. To be contrarian, The New York Times’ <a href="http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/our-nightly-bread-2/?_r=1" target="_blank">Frank Bruni argued for the extra fees</a>. Personally, I wouldn’t choose to go back to a place that charged me for bread, but that doesn’t mean I can’t see the argument for this policy.</p>
<p><strong><em>No-shows</em></strong><br />
You made a reservation, the restaurant is holding your table, and you never show up and don’t even call? Seems fair to charge a penalty so selfish barbarians don’t abuse the privilege, especially in cities like New York where aggressive diners have been known to make reservations at three venues for the same time and day - to hold the spots - and only show up at one at the last minute. (It’s easy for restaurateurs to charge your credit card if you book through online reservation sites). The Wall Street Journal chronicled the practice a year ago; rates range from $50 (OpenTable’s fee) to $225 (the full price of the prix fixe at <a href="http://www.brooklynfare.com/pages/chefs-table" target="_blank">Chef&#039;s Table at Brooklyn Fare</a>).</p>
<p><strong><em>Certain substitutions</em></strong><br />
I have no idea if the fries really cost more or less than a salad at any given restaurant, but if a dish normally comes with one side dish and you’d like a different one, you should be notified about the price difference and understand that some of the fee goes to the extra effort of making the chef (or server) plate something in an unfamiliar way. Not all menus are designed to mix and match - much to the chagrin of vegetarians, allergy sufferers, the lactose-intolerant and <a href="http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2013/08/02/fda-sets-gluten-free-labeling-standards/" target="_blank">gluten avoiders</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eating at prime time</em></strong><br />
Famed New York dining institution Le Cirque once toyed with the idea of <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/10/09/choice-dining-time-surcharges-likely-coming-to-new-york-city-restaurants/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">“formalizing a prime-time price increase,”</a> according to CBS. The idea is simple: Everyone wants to eat between 6 and 8 p.m. - not at 5:30 or 10:30 p.m. Charging more for access during the dinner rush is not unlike nightclubs that charge more after midnight when the dance floor is packed and they don’t need bodies to fill the space anymore. Frankly, I’m surprised no one charges for premium seating (bigger tables, far from the bathrooms, etc.) in New York restaurants...yet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tips for large groups</em></strong><br />
You just had a steak dinner with six buddies. The bill comes and there’s an extra 20% at the bottom. Does that count as an extra fee? No. Is it fair? Yes - as long as the gratuity does not exceed 20%. Admittedly there are two potential downsides to this practice: First, if the service sucks, you’re forced to pay this healthy tip anyway. Second, and far worse, some bills hide this automatically added fee, which leads the occasional diner to pay an unintended second tip on top.</p>
<p><strong><em>Corkage</em></strong><br />
If you’re bringing your own wine to a restaurant and thus not paying for a bottle from their list (would you ever dare to bring your own food?), then it makes sense that management would charge an extra charge fee (to discourage the practice and to make up some of the lost revenue). It’s the amount that can be galling. $20? Fine. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/05/16/america-most-expensive-restaurants-to-byob/" target="_blank">$75 to $100?</a> Too rich for my blood. But if you’re dining at places like <a href="http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2013/04/29/worlds-50-best-restaurants-announced-for-2013/" target="_blank">Per Se or French Laundry</a>, what do you expect? Call first and ask about the policy to be sure.</p>
<p><strong><em>Access to the room with live music</em></strong><br />
If a band is playing, of course, it’s ok to charge extra for those customers who want to be closer to the music. <a href="http://helsinkihudson.com/" target="_blank">Helsinki Hudson</a>, for example, requires separate reservations depending on whether you’re eating at the restaurant or inside the club - even though both are under the same roof. Sometimes, though, I wish venues would pay me to continue to endure listening.</p>

  This link is a NY TImes story about hotels adding numerous fees for travelers.  When I travel for business, I prefer to have the charges added in- internet particularly.  Some hotels charge for this but provide it free for &#034;members&#034; as an incentive to have you in their database.  I am including this as a parallel to the discussion.  It is a revenue opportunity for the hotels who say the rate would be higher if they were to include everything- this way, the guest chooses what services they wish to purchase.  Maybe, but &#8211; what next?  Charging for the pillow?  The beverage straw?  Coaster?</p>

      <p>As long as customers continue to pay these ridiculous inflated fees I am sure restaurants will continue to charge them.  The only way customers are going to get rid of them is to refuse to pay them and tell the restaurants that as long as they charge these fees that they have lost your business.  If enough of us do this, only then will they quit charging them.</p>

<p>Better to blacklist the person if they don&#039;t call. They can&#039;t place a reservation again.</p>

      <p>You just had a steak dinner with six buddies. The bill comes and there’s an extra 20% at the bottom. Does that count as an extra fee? No. Is it fair? Yes &#8211; as long as the gratuity does not exceed 20%.<br />
Are you kidding? A 20% hike for a table of 6? That&#039;s daylight robbery and cannot be justified in any rational manner.  It is more beneficial and cost-effective for the restaurant to have 6 diners at once than 6 individuals.  Nobody is charged 20% extra for buying 6 beers/loaves/tomatoes/cars or whatever at one time.</p>

      <p>I certainly understand a split plate fee when the dish is divided and plated in the kitchen, but charging for a small dish so I can hand someone at the same table a taste of my food? Would they prefer I just use my bread plate?</p>
<p>I was with workmates at an upscale asian bistro in LA, and someone asked about my tom yum shrimp soup. She had never even heard of it, and thought the ingredients sounded strange but intriguing. I asked the server for a small cup so I could give her a taste. No, I wasn&#039;t going to just spoon some into her mouth or pass my bowl to her - there were three people seated between us and I didn&#039;t know her well enough to share utensils. She liked it so much that she ordered a bowl for herself. We had already paid the bill before we noticed that there was a $2 charge for the extra sharing dish. Really? They didn&#039;t loose a dime on this split; the extra cup resulted in an additional full-sized bowl being ordered. We were annoyed, but not enough to complain.</p>

      <p>I think that your wrong when you said that the business should pay the credit card fees. I think that it should be an extra fee if I want to use my credit card. Most businesses just add that into the plate cost. What about the person that pays with cash. It is a convenience for me to use a card instead of cash.</p>

      <p>This is really sloppy journalism and seems more like cranky editorializing. There are too many mistakes to point out, but not understanding the tax code in NYC is a good start. UN-manipulated food (e.g. a loaf of bread, a bagel) is a grocery item and is not taxed. Once its been altered, its a restaurant item. Its pretty simple.<br />
There are plenty of interesting, provocative pieces you could write about the restaurant business. This is not one of them.</p>

      <p>So, 6 sliced bagels from Panera gets more tax than 6 sliced bagels in the grocery store&#039;s bread aisle. Does this apply to a loaf of bread, too? What about bakeries, am I being taxed by the state if they slice my rye bread? When did greed and insanity become the norm?</p>

      <p>You should come to eat in Italy. There&#039;s a 1 or 2 euro service charge per person and waitresses are paid a salary so tipping is not expected. You can split dishes in restaurants and no one will think you&#039;re one step up from homeless. Bread is included in the service charge. Lots of places will actually round down your bill, rather than up. Lots of places will give you a free drink at the end of your meal if you&#039;re friendly.</p>

      <p>Ha! We juste returned from a month in Europe with 2 weeks of Italy. I was somewhat pi$$ed with that place. We were charged 2 euros per person at some restaurant. We didn&#039;t know there was such charge nor was it written anywhere until we got the bill... then the waiter showed showed it to us &#8211; it was written in Italian in fineprint on the menu. Then he said &#034;This is normal for every restaurant in Italy&#034;.... it was our first time since we had been in Italy (almost 2 weeks). Then in Rome, another restaurant charged us also 2 euros per person but it included two entrées and a glass of sparkling wine each. BEWARE IN VENICE: a coffee in Place St-Marc will cost you 35 euros and you are billed in advance. Sitting down at a table in Place St-Marc will cost you 15 euros per person as &#034;cover charge&#034;. Also in Venice, they will refuse that you split a pizza or eat a pizza on the street (because on the street, the view is nicer than inside therefore they keep the nice tables for people who spend more). We had 4 drinks (a beer, a strawberry diquiry, a fresh orange juice and a lemon slushy) in Sorrento and the bill was 25.50 Euros.</p>

      <p>The &#039;coperto&#039; IS in every restaurant/trattoria/pizzeria in Italy! Not sure how you missed that. Piazza San Marco is the most expensive piazza in Italy and, yeah, Venice is the most beautiful, amazing but rip-off tourist trap I know about. Never been to Sorrento but you got stiffed there too. Sorry, man, hope it didn&#039;t put you off Italy for good.</p>
<p>A pizza and a beer for two where I live in Genoa would cost you from $20-$40 depending on the pizza. 10 years ago it would&#039;ve been around $12-15. Times change. Peace.</p>

<p>The author of this article is woefully ignorant to how restaurants operate. The idea that the charge goes into a cook or waiter&#039;s pocket shows that this individual either never worked in a restaurant or is purposefully misleading the reader to fit their agenda.</p>

      <p>Dave could not agree more.  I feel dumber for reading this article, but fortunately I have enough common sense to disregard this gibberish. The writer sounds like a fresh college grad who just swallowed a big pill, i.e. he took a date to a big city dinner and &#034;golly that&#039;s expensive.&#034;  The writer, being used to ordering from a cashier and paying before his meal, is like a new born deer trying to walk on ice.  Out of his element, he fights his confused fears with a keyboard.</p>

      <p>... or, you fail at reading comprehension. The author is in no way saying that the extra fee actually goes into the chef&#039;s pocket. He&#039;s merely saying that since it requires extra effort *by* the chef, the restaurant is justified in charging an extra fee.</p>

      <p>The fee is not charge because of the extra two seconds of plating. Its charged because a table has a dollar value attached to it. At a non churn and burn style restaurant, each table is expensive real estate. If you are too cheap to order something with out the surcharge you are costing the restaurant money by occupying that space. The charge recoups a partial amount of the loss with the charge.  If patrons do not like it and choose not to come back, the charge is killing two birds with one stone. </p>
<p>Its not a reading comprehension issue for me, its the writer&#039;s lack of common sense on why a charge may be applied.</p>

      <p>You and I obviously disagree on the intent of the author&#039;s writing, yennieb. But, if you want to insult me by saying that I &#034;fail at reading comprehension,&#034; because you have a different point-of-view, then I could retort by saying that I would be happy to wage my doctorate degree against whatever level of education you have. Now, I sound petty, and haven&#039;t helped our conversation. See how much lower the bar becomes when you insult someone?</p>

      <p>Dave, I was defending the author who you insulted by calling &#034;woefully ignorant&#034; and/or &#034;purposefully misleading the reader&#034;. Your example was: &#034;The idea that the charge goes into a cook or waiter&#039;s pocket&#034;. His exact words: &#034;some of the fee goes to the extra effort of making the chef (or server) plate something in an unfamiliar way&#034;. It&#039;s a stretch at best to infer from that that the author believes the fee ends up in anyone&#039;s pocket other than the owner. Occam&#039;s razor here: it&#039;s a slightly ambiguous sentence, not a complete lack of common sense or hidden agenda.</p>
<p>I&#039;m sorry if I offended your doctorate-level intelligence. Turns out we&#039;re both highly educated, but in this particular instance you set the tone and then cried &#034;insulting&#034; when it came back at you. I guess you figured everyone should be civil, except when insulting the author.</p>

      <p>As I said before, you and I disagree on intent.  </p>
<p>“some of the fee goes to the extra effort of making the chef (or server) plate something in an unfamiliar way.&#034;</p>
<p>Earlier in the article, he also writes, “if the request requires time and effort from a server to literally divide the dish and garnishes, then a separate fee seems warranted.”</p>
<p>Yes, the commentary is on two different topics (substitutions vs. split plates), but together in context, it is not a stretch to infer that he intimates that the fees for these types of occurrences are in some way remitted to the parties responsible for actually handling the servicing of the request.  </p>
<p>No offense taken, but to suggest that because you and I disagree must mean that I fail at reading comprehension doesn’t help your argument, and it’s sadly typical of today’s discourse. </p>
<p>By the way, “not a complete lack of common sense,” was not what I was inferring. I am not insulting him, but pointing out that it does not sound like he knows what he is writing about. And reading some of the other comments, it appears that other readers feel the same way.</p>

      <p>Is the writer under 21?  A rocks or a neat pour is different than a single. This is basic stuff, as in the writer may still be hitting up AYCD nights at the local college dive.</p>
<p>The extra plate charge makes sense too.  Its not the time or service, its the fact that a table or booth is being under utilized. Restaurants operate on thin margins and the have to serve X customers a night to break-even. Cheap people splitting dishes to save money is a waste of the table and the servers time. I see people do it all the time, but can not figure out how they have reached this point of their life with such poor restaurant etiquette.  McDonalds, Arbys, Chick-fila-A, etc all have dine in areas and you do not even have to tip.  If you can not afford it, do not eat out. Additionally, you could save up for a special occasion and order like an adult.</p>

      <p>Some people do split meals not because they are cheap, but because they can&#039;t eat the entire portion themselves, and it&#039;s better than throwing half the meal into the trash can, or stuffing it down after there&#039;s no longer any space or appetite for it.  Yes, you could take half of it home with you, but some items really do not do well re-heated.  That being said, I do understand why restaurants charge a fee for that extra plate.</p>

If you read this article and feel that way, you are type of customer the restaurants want to avoid.  Please learn to cook yourself and do not waste others time. Food is an experience and should be enjoyed. Its not a matter of how fast and cheaply can I eat as the writer suggests you should strive for. Sit down, order a nice wine, and meal and enjoy the service. I can not believe that CNN greenlighted someone that does not enjoy food to write a column regarding food.</p>

      <p>As a boss it&#039;s been my experience that people that whine and complain about every little thing aren&#039;t worth the effort to serve. They choose the cheapest meal, not one they might actually enjoy, order water when they really want a nice wine, are very demanding of the servers time and leave them little or no tip. Then they get on Yelp and complain about the horrible meal they just had. I think people go into just about any situation with a preconceived notion as to what the experience is going to be like and then proceed to make it so. It becomes a self-fulling prophecy...</p>

      <p>actually chaz , you should do your homework if you are going tomake everything a political argument . There is a higher percentage of people recieving federal aid in almost ALL of the red states than in the blue states. OH and before you go and start saying that too many people are on welfare : in 2012 only 4.1% of americans were on welfare . So that is less than 5 out of a hundred . 38.8% of those people are white ,39.8 are black 15.7, are hispanic (white, black and mixed ), only 2.4 % are asian and the rest are other .  Also 40 states pay more to be on welfare  than to have an $8.00 per hour job . That is because unlike minimum wage jobs welfare is designed on a &#034;living wage &#034;  .  Minimum wage jobs  are NOT designed to be jobs one could survive on .  source : http://www.statisticbrain.com/welfare-statistics/       Really, this is NOT the place to air your blue/red  opinions .</p>

      <p>If you don&#039;t understand a rocks charge, even though you understand that a rocks pour is larger than a standard mixed drink pour, then you don&#039;t understand math. Why would they charge you more for two hamburgers than they would for one? Can&#039;t they just make it easier on me? I hate when non-industry folks write about their &#034;informed&#034; opinions on drinking and dining. Just an FYI: all size soft drinks at McDonalds are the same price!

      <p>The point the article is bringing up is that it&#039;s nickel and dime. The difference in cost is not same same as burgers. The notion of such is ridiculous on your part...  If you&#039;re that worried about the cost of a few ounces then raise the cost of the drink entirely. Make it universal and stop complicating things. People hate being nickel and dimed for stupid small idiotic reasons.</p>

      <p>Sorry, but you&#039;re very incorrect. Every half ounce of liquor costs a lot more than you imagine, considering every expense that goes into running a restaurant/bar. Especially in NYC. You&#039;re not paying for the food or liquor, you&#039;re paying for the real estate. Welcome to New York City.</p>
<p>Complaining about a dollar or two more for a half ounce of liquor, or that Red Bull mixer, or whatever, is missing the point and 9.5 times out of 10, you (generalizing) take it out on the service folk. </p>
<p>If you don&#039;t like the prices and you can&#039;t afford to properly tip on top of those prices, you shouldn&#039;t be eating/drinking at said place. Simple.</p>

      <p>Pretty much. If you&#039;re worried about the extra surcharges, many of which are designed to keep away people who want extras but don&#039;t want to pay for it, you shouldn&#039;t be there. And the plate fee is to keep a table from losing money when people who don&#039;t want to get two of them expensive dishes but lock up a table for an hour or more.</p>

      <p>The worst is charging to use the restroom on a flight. If one is on a tight budget, and already maxed out with the other ridiculous add-on fees for air travel, they would avoid hydration during a flight. And they would refrain from using the restroom when the call comes. Both are very unhealthy practices that could lead to dehydration and UTIs. Not to mention that getting up and walking to the restroom can help prevent blood clots from inactivity. But I hope the airline is able to earn a few dollars by putting health at risk.</p>

      <p>funny enough, but the airline isnt forcing you to fly anywhere. if you cant afford to pay the fee maybe you should stay home. in all likelihood you CAN afford the price of admission nut just dont want to pay it. thats YOUR fault, not the airlines.<br />

      <p>only the ignorant and those who want service but dont want to pay for it.</p>
<p>the price of an airline ticket today is far lower than the price was 20 or 30 years ago adjusted for inflation and little higher real dollars, despite huge increases in fuel cost. </p>
<p>want service? you can get great service and plenty of room on an airplane. it&#039;s called first class. some first class &#039;seats&#039; are private cabins these days with beds and your choice gourmet meal selections. but you have to PAY for it.</p>
<p>todays consume wants to go to a low fair finder web site, get the lowest price ticket they can find, then complains they arent getting first class service.</p>

      <p>I found one item interesting &#8211; charging for bread.  Many restaurants do it abroad and they are missing the boat.  I worked my way through college as a waitress and was told the secret of the bread at each restaurant.  Money is made in a restaurant through serving drinks not food.  Soda is pure profit and as mentioned, a glass of wine in a restaurant is the same cost as a bottle in a store (at 4 to 5 servings for bottle..you do the math).  So why serve bread for free?  Because it&#039;s how a restaurant makes a profit.  When you sit down you order a drink.  You then eat the bread which is highly salted.  The more bread you eat, the more you will drink.  If you are served a drink when you are seated and then eat the bread, you will usually order one or sometimes two extra drinks BEFORE the actual meal arrives.  That one serving of bread has netted a very large profit made on drinks.  Food may bring customers in to a restaurant, but the drinks keep the establishment solvent.  If a restaurant denies it, they are not telling you the truth.</p>

      <p>An interesting and thoughtful article, thank you. I&#039;ve a comment on the corkage fee. There are very good reasons to bring in your own wine. Basically, the restaurant makes a huge profit on something it didn&#039;t make, and whose quality it can only harm by improper storage. Many customers know very well what taste they like with their food. They may have special varieties or wineries they like. Having a customer bring a familiar taste with them to the table is certain to improve the customer&#039;s perception of the food quality.</p>
<p>If a customer has a sophisticated palate, the chances are good they have better taste than the restaurant does, or that the restaurant buyer has. The very best deals in a restaurant&#039;s wine are likely to be gone, and what&#039;s left grossly overpriced. If I was having a special dinner? I&#039;d absolutely bring my own wine. It might very well end up being cheaper and better.</p>

      <p>Wine is almost always the lowest markup at restaurants. You may think a 4 to 1 markup sounds high, but 25% cost is  ot a great margin running a business. t is not as if the markup is all profit for the restaurant. They pay rent, salaries, electric bill, insurance, etc. It costs money to run a restaurant. Their margins are actually typically very slim. Look how many restaurants come and go. It is a tough business. When you go out to a restaurant, you might get the same wine at a higher price, but you are not at home. You go out for the experiance. That experiance has value, and it is not free.</p>

      <p>I clicked on the article for the one about the buffet &#034;waste charge&#034;. It was a story on the UK Mail website about 3 people who had to pay a fee at a buffet for having a little bit left on their plate. A bunch of British fools in the comment section were actually defending a chinese food buffet&#039;s $32(£20) waste surcharge, and the buffet for 3 people already cost about $30(£18) before the charge. The charge for leaving food on your plate there is actually more than it costs to get into the buffet! The chinese buffet near me costs $7 a person, that&#039;s $21 for 3 people, with no &#034;waste&#034; charge. The family of three ended up paying $60(£38) for three people at this place, compared to where I live in the US where it would only be $21(£13.5) for the same thing. </p>
<p>The British people who were commenting defending this are crazy. They must be used to getting ripped off. Keep that idiocy on the other side of the pond, and speaking of British idiocy, take back Pierce Morgan too.</p>

      <p>There is an important distinction between the two restaurants.  Any Chinese restaurant that charges $7 per person for an all-you-can-eat buffet is serving absolute garbage.  Fast-food Chinese at best. It&#039;ll be soaking in sugary glazes, deep fried and no Cantonese authenticity.  Essentially, the American version of Chinese food.  A place that offers true Chinese dishes (particularly as a buffet) will charge SIGNIFICANTLY more than $7 and if food is wasted, they will try to discourage it by charging for it.  Food that gets taken but not eaten means the kitchen staff has to work that much harder to keep the buffet stocked and go through that much more inventory for nothing.</p>

      <p>&#034;They must be used to getting ripped off.&#034;<br />
They are, have you seen their income tax rates and their sales tax?  (Called V.A.T.) Somewhere above 18% I think on almost *any* transaction.</p>
<p>Chinese buffets seems to be the most tight-fisted out there.  I used to go to one where the owner would follow you and glare if you went back twice and he&#039;d start slicing the roast beef so thin you could see daylight through it.  The comedian John Pinnet (sp?) does a hysterical routine on this sort of thing.</p>

      <p>What so many people are failing to see is that the business is set up by the business&#039; owner and they provide a service to the people the business&#039; owner feels is needed.  If you do not like the cost, the provisions, the ambiance, the people, then please save yourself the drama and disappointment and do not go there.  This is a very high failure rate industry because of the varying types of businesses.  Some last only a few short lived months and others will lavish us for decades, this doesn&#039;t mean they do everything for you.  This means they attend to the guests, employees, and neighborhood as best they can.  They try to make a difference within the business&#039; owners boundaries.  These boundaries should exist because the business owner is taking the risk of opening their vision, desire, hearts to you.  You should appreciate the fact someone cared enough to try their best to provide you with what they felt would be the best night out you&#039;ve had.  And, frankly, if you didn&#039;t have the best night, if it bothers you so much that you paid $3 more for an extra plate with a slightly larger portion on the plate so that it may sate you, if it bothers you to pay more for a little stronger pour in that glass because you didn&#039;t want to have ice, if it bothers you to pay for a sauce that some minimum wage soul spent time and effort to make so that it may brighten that one little spot in your heart, then you have missed the point.  People do not get into this business for the money, they do it for the love and enjoyment of having someone leave with a smile on their face.</p>

      <p>To quote a serious restaurateur (Uncle) Jack Degel: &#034;Your restaurant is one of thousands, there may be another right across the street, people can go *anywhere* they want.

<p>Nickel and dining them the moment they walk in the door will assure you are in another line of work eventually.  If I spend $100/person on a meal, I certainly do not expect to be charged for a couple of rolls and butter or a glass of water or an extra (empty) plate and will definitely go elsewhere the next time.</p>

      <p>And at the end you do understand, &#034;(you) will definitely go elsewhere the next time.&#034;...  That is exactly what you should do...  To quote a successful business man, I know of, he goes by the name of Bill Cosby, &#034;I don&#039;t know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everyone.&#034;  Just as there are thousands of restaurants bidding for your business, there are millions of people who want to eat our food.  Remember that next time you feel your opinion is more important than the person who worked to create what you are purchasing.</p>

      <p>What about anchovies and Caesar salad.  My understanding is that an authentic, traditional Caesar salad comes with anchovies &#8211; the real stuff, not homogenized in a dressing.  I love anchovies, and without them, a Caesar salad is NOT a Caesar salad.  And yet, if I&#039;m ordering a Caesar salad and I ask if the restaurant has anchovies, for some reason the staff assumes that I am asking because I don&#039;t like anchovies.  If they do have anchovies, I am often charged extra, which irritates me no end.</p>

      <p>No matter how much that irritates you, it will never change. Maybe you should get over it. When I was young and I complained about things, my Mom would often say &#034;if that is the worst thing you have to deal with today, that is a pretty good day&#034;.</p>

      <p>So what about the restaurant that didn&#039;t have biscuits and gravy on the menu by itself, but did include it with a more expensive item.  I didn&#039;t have the budget for the more expensive item so I asked the waitress if they had biscuits and gravy only.  They did and she quoted me the price which wasn&#039;t out of line.  Being a little bit hungry, I asked if I could get an extra biscuit, expecting a bump in the price but not specifically asking.  Big mistake; when I got my bill, it was for two separate orders at full price for each.  All I got was an extra biscuit under the gravy, which is all I wanted, but this??? The restaurant wouldn&#039;t adjust the bill, so I sent an email explaining (and complaining) to the franchise.  I even complimented the restaurant service, cleanliness, and atmosphere.  The Egg and I management never gave me the courtesy of a reply, much less an adjustment.  I will never voluntarily patronize another Egg and I.  I keep the bill framed on the wall to remind me, and to let me tell the story to whoever asks about it.  If you agree that I was gouged, please consider going to another restaurant the next time you dine out.</p>

      <p>The order seems to read Biscuits (note the plural) and gravy.  Plus one extra biscuit does not equal two orders of biscuits (note the plural again) and gravy.  If they charge for two orders of something, they da** well better bring me *two* full orders of the item or they are ripping me off.  A surcharge for the extra biscuit yes, but not doubling the charge without doubling the order.</p>

      <p>I&#039;m all for the extra charges.  I vote for a place with my wallet based on my sense of contentedness after eating.  If I am not happy, then I won&#039;t return and my money will go elsewhere from then on.  Good article.

      <p>And calling then restrooms or washrooms instead of bathrooms is better?  Folks don&#039;t go there for rest any more than for a bath, and while they may wash up afterwards, it is usually not the primary purpose.</p>
<p>&#034;I&#039;m going to the bathroom&#034; is a common euphemism for what really goes on there, so bathroom is just fine.</p>

      <p>Dining out should be enjoyable, shouldn&#039;t it? This thread makes it sound so awful my stomach hurts after reading some of it. But having read, I think the common denominators of concern are lack of mutual respect, courtesy, the easy feel of hospitality and plain old manners. Can you tell I&#039;m Southern? As a diner/consumer, I&#039;m about half dead/broke from being &#034;nickel and dimed&#034; from about every angle/profession @ every angle anyone could possibly come up with to make an extra nickel, dime or to make ends meet. I love good food, appreciate good people &amp; service &amp; atmosphere &amp; professionalism and happily show it (gratuity) when I see it. It&#039;s not that complicated. Restaurants are businesses and like all other businesses these days, I&#039;m so tired of the drain, hidden and upfront fees and all.</p>

A fee for not finishing what&#039;s on your plate? Sure, but you must also allow me to pour the excess food down the owner&#039;s shirt first.</p>

      <p>No, sorry. No charge for a no-show. That&#039;s just part of the cost of a restaurant doing business. They can fill their tables with walk-in customers. When I make a reservation, that&#039;s not a contract. If I don&#039;t show, I didn&#039;t get anything, so I&#039;m not paying for anything. If that hurts the restaurant, too bad. That&#039;s part of the business. The idea they could charge for such a thing is not only arrogant, it&#039;s offensive, and borderline criminal.</p>

      <p>Agreed. I doubt many restaurants would leave a table vacant for the entire time that I would have been dining. I think it&#039;s better to put a limit on the reservation time to encourage people to be on time. For higher-end &#8211; 30 min past and your name&#039;s off the list. For lower-end, you have to be there when your name&#039;s called or you&#039;re passed over.</p>

      <p>Try making a hotel reservation and not showing up.  You paid to have a table and it was there for you.  Others may have called and were told that nothing was available at that time and so, they went elsewhere.  You cannot assume that the table was easily filled.  It took a wait to determine that you were a No Show.  It is common courtesy to call and cancel if you are not going to show up.  If you fail to do so, you will be charged for the loss.  This happened because people were making multiple reservations for the same night and not bothering to cancel.  Not criminal, legal.</p>

      <p>a reservation is much like an appointment, if you fail to show for a doctors appointment you are charged . IF i have to hold a tables for a no show why should i lose money for your inconsideration. yes i could get walk ins but no turnover on the tables.</p>

      <p>In Australia &#8211; corkage is only $2 at most....NYC such a rip off and your food is not that great, though you try to make out that it&#039;s the bomb.  Ligone street in Melbourne walks all over &#034;Little Italy&#034; and the rest of the eateries sprinkled in the CBD are FAR better as well, plus won&#039;t break the bank.</p>
<p>Even in the suburbs, Hampton, VIC as an example &#8211; food there rivals what you yanks are pushing in NYC.</p>

      <p>It&#039;s not apples and bananas. He&#039;s making a direct comparison, which you&#039;d know if your parents taught YOU anything. If a reservation is going to be treated like a contract, then both sides are liable. If I&#039;m going to get charged for being late, I should get a discount if I arrive on time and get seated late.

reading comprehension isnt your strong point, is it?<br />
the poster isnt asking to be rewarded for doing what he is supposed to be doing. he is saying if he DOES what he is supposed to do, and the establishment FAILS to do the same, then there should be a penalty in his favor, just as there would be a penalty in the establishments favor if he failed to hold up his end of the agreement. it&#039;s treating the two parties exactly the same. dont do what you agree to and you pay for it.</p>

      <p>Silliness, as most of those establishments fill the seats without so much as a pause. Attempting to equate the important of a meal with anything else is silly. If you have more than one no-show no longer book a seat.</p>

      <p>Really think about this everybody.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, the rule of restaurant management was to charge 3 times the cost of the raw food.  This really worked for decades.  Starting about 20 years ago, this multiple has soared to 5X to 10X.  Pasta and sauce and a bare salad - ingredients valued at $1.50 &#8211; being served for $13.95!!!</p>
<p>Why has this MULTIPLE soared.  This is not a factor of inflation.  We&#039;re talking about the multiple.  What has changed so dramatically?</p>

      <p>Bick, you sound like a loser who can&#039;t get any other job than a waiter. Perhaps if you had studied in school, or smoked less pot, or didn&#039;t throw your life away on frivolous pursuits you&#039;d be less angry at people who are paying your bills for you: your customers. The point you seem to be missing is that as the customers, we matter, you don&#039;t. WE don&#039;t want YOU as our waiter. We&#039;re the one&#039;s with the money. Your job only exists in order to please us. So get off your high horse and realize what your job actually is: pleasing us. Or quit and find another job, because you obviously don&#039;t have the personality nor temperament to be a food server. I bet you are the kind of guy that expects a fat tip just for carrying my food from the kitchen to my table. It isn&#039;t like you are skilled labor.</p>

      <p>I&#039;m a restaurant owner... if you think you can get the ingredients for $1.50 you must be shopping with a time machine. Also, not all items on the menu even have a mark-up. My lobster ravioli barely breaks even on supplies cost, but as one of the things we are well known for, it puts people in the seats who then spend on apps, drinks, desserts etc- which is what pays the bills.</p>

      <p>In fairness, how is that any different from most businesses? A clothing store puts stuff on sale at a loss with the hope that people will buy things that aren&#039;t on sale. A car dealership does the same thing with the most popular model, hoping that when it is gone that people who wanted that car will buy something similar at a higher price. Business takes investment. I&#039;m a private tutor, and there are plenty of days when I&#039;m sitting in my car waiting to go tutor someone and get a call they canceled, and because of the nature of the business I can&#039;t charge them for it (Not if I want to keep their business). My brother is a chef, and I know the high costs of running a restaurant. Most fail, but the successful ones can make you into a millionaire, if you aren&#039;t already. When someone is spending the only money they have that month to go out somewhere nice, the last thing we want to hear is how the restaurant has problems. Keep it to yourself, give good service and good food at good prices, and you&#039;ll do fine. Start nickel-and-diming us and we&#039;ll find somewhere else to go.</p>

      <p>If I set up a new restaurant like they did in the 50&#039;s with hard wood seats, bad lighting, paper menu, and cheap $0.75 per hour kitchen help, I would not be able to stay open a week.<br />
 The cost of the elec. bill back then was $100 a month for a mid size restaurant and now $3,200, water was free and now $1,200 a month. I pay between $18,000. &#8211; $20,000. amonth for over head that&#039;s 34%, labor 26%, COGS (food &amp; beverage cost) 24% so that leaves me with a 20% profit and that is why we now charge $13.95 for pasta.</p>

      <p>This is a well written misinformed opinion piece.  Yes, I understand this is your opinion, but you either do not understand basic business principles or you&#039;re not very empathetic.  To not be empathetic to the person who had to make the steak sauce/butter and not be willing to pay the same mark up as you would for any other food menu item, is sad.  When you split a dish, you often receive 10-20% more of that dish as a rule of thumb, this then would explain to your concerns for the extra charge.  Should I give you a half ounce for free, sure, let me just eat that $.35 to $.75...  and I will do so for everyone, this couldn&#039;t possible hurt my business.  Or even better gouge the person who doesn&#039;t want as much so you can have better piece of mind in paying a little less for your drink.  Not bottled, filters water... sure it doesn&#039;t cost me anything to pay for this chilled filtration system my building and the city make me use... on the house!...  In short, because I just closed the restaurant I work at, lets give you everything you desire, make you more and make you pay less...  You have little concept of restaurants, bars, or business, I strongly advise you to speak to that new guy there at CNN.  I hear he has worked in a few places.  I think his name is Bourdain.</p>

      <p>You have a point with almost everything except the splitting the dish part. You say that when a dish gets split that the customers get extra. I&#039;m not sure why that should be, but it seems to be a decision you&#039;re making as the chef, not something being demanded by the customers, who have no idea they are getting extra the majority of the time. I&#039;ve split plates before and never expected extra. Why include extra? So the plate looks better? Isn&#039;t that an ego thing for the chef, not something the customer needs to worry about? The few extra cents in water that it costs to wash the extra dish is something you can pay for as the restaurant owner. As you should know, when a dish is split the server often gets a bigger tip, in compensation for the extra effort. So things work out. When restaurants demand every little thing gets paid for I&#039;m going to take my dollars elsewhere.</p>

      <p>The extra received is the bread and butter eaten, cloth napkin laundered, water and glasses, flatware all washed and dried for the second person who is &#034;just tasting&#034; besides the plate itself being tasted from.  The charge is often to recover the cost of serving two persons for a single entree fee.  This is not incurred when someone just dips their fork over and tastes but when the guests expect the item (and sides) to be divided in the kitchen- and yes, each often get more.</p>

      <p>You&#039;re required to have fire extinguishers and toilets too, you build their cost into the price of a meal.  I have to admit I doubt any city requires you to install a filter and chilling system for table water but I could be wrong.  Please give us a citation that one.</p>
<p>Seems kind of like charging extra to actually *cook* the food.</p>

A reservation is not a contract. It is an appointment. If I don&#039;t show up, I owe you nothing. In fact, I think I&#039;m going to start making reservations all over the place and not show up just in protest of scumbags like you. Congratulations, your rant will have specifically targets detrimental effects because of your post. Every time I&#039;m going to go out, I&#039;m going to make reservations at five places, and only show up to one. I can do it online. If you think I&#039;m EVER going to be charged a dime for that you are a crack smoking, knuckle-dragging moron.</p>

      <p>I ordered the food, and paid for it already.  Whether I eat all of it or not is immaterial.  It is gone either way.  To me, restaurants give you too much food.  If I am traveling and am staying in a hotel, I can&#039;t really take it with me.  Of course, if you are talking about a buffet, that is an entirely different story.  You can take just a bite, and get more if you really like something.</p>

      <p>What do you mean &#034;food waste&#034;? You mean I get charge extra if I don&#039;t finish all my food? Screw you! What if it sucks? Do I get to charge the restaurant for wasting my time? And as for charging me for missing my reservation, you can go screw yourself. A reservation is not a contract. I owe the restaurant nothing if I don&#039;t show up, since they provided me with nothing. A promise of holding a table is worthless. Anyone who has ever paid for such a thing is a total idiot.</p>

      <p>Precisely how is a restaurant going to &#034;force&#034; me to pay for a reservation I  didn&#039;t show up for? Restaurants in my area don&#039;t require deposits or credit card numbers for reservations. If a restaurant did ask for my credit card number to make a reservation, I would hang up and go somewhere else.</p>

      <p>i go to a bar that serves food, i tend to like mayonnaise with my fries. when it first opened, they would provide for free, then i went in one day and now they charge an extra $1, though ketchup is free. really a bar where you&#039;re drinking heavily marked up drinks, and they charge $1 for condiments.</p>

      <p>Are we talking chef-prepared mayo/aoli or is this just Kraft mayo from a jar? You would expect to pay extra to have chili on your fries because chili is an item you might order and pay for on its own. But mayo is condiment, unless someone is actually whisking eggs and oil back in the kitchen.</p>

      <p>I managed restaurants for many years.</p>
<p>Proper way of handling a sharing charge</p>
<p>1.  Either listed on the menu or have waiter explain it before ordering (if requested).  If the customer wasn&#039;t informed before they order then it would be deceitful to charge.</p>
<p>2. extra plate charge should include an extra side and starter... unless A la cart </p>
<p>3 inform customer there is no sharing allowed.  Usually meaning the other person must order something.  This doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t share your food. Just we will not bring you a empty plate with out ordering something. This is done usually at high end restaurants or at peak time. </p>
<p>Adding a tip on a part of 8 or more is common.  Some restaurants enforce it, some leave it up to serverr. Getting burned on a party will ruin a servers day. Most of the time that table will consume most of their resources. They usually stay longer and need extra presence.  A table can ask the manager to waive this if they feel services wasn&#039;t par....the manger can also deny this request.</p>

      <p>Because you are taking up a chair that a paying customer could be for one. During prime time many people are turned away because there is no room which results in lost revenue if you decide to get and extra plate and order a glass of water. It also offsets the costs of other things that are gratis such as bread and butter for a table, and if the writer of the article doesn&#039;t understand that there are other overhead charges such as linen fees, personal that service the customer that isn&#039;t paying and restaurants are not cheap to run, a small one where I live is easily $5,000 a month rent. The reasons are numerous and to keep entrees at a reasonable price point this fee is not unreasonable.</p>

      <p>Except that doesn&#039;t make sense because the table is taken already. Unless they are going to sit someone else at your table with you, it doesn&#039;t make sense. I could see it at a Japanese steakhouse, perhaps, where multiple parties might in fact share the same table and so someone not eating is taking up a seat, but otherwise? I guess you could say they&#039;ll dirty plates, but that&#039;s really a non cost since dishes are washed in mass and no individual person&#039;s plate is going to require the machine to be run an additional time.</p>

      <p>I frequently go out all by my lonesome. Very few, if any restaurants have tables &#034;for one&#034;; usually the table I am seated at has two chairs. That extra chair sits empty until I leave.  So what would be the big deal if I had a friend tag along who ordered his/her own drink, but then shared my fries and half my sandwich? The restaurant wouldn&#039;t be losing any money by my friend sitting in the extra chair.</p>

      <p>Rick, Nathan,Cadet... I don&#039;t think any of you see how this attitude is getting abused. When I see this behavior typically it&#039;s in a large party, some thing like a group of 7 or more and this is when it starts to cost restaurant owners money. Two table have to be put together ahead of time to accommodate, walk-ins can&#039;t have those seats, so you turn business away, then you are prepped for 7 orders and end up getting only 4 because 3 people decided to share plates and we can&#039;t make up for this with drinks because they order water, and the server can&#039;t ignore them, they have to be treated like everyone else, so refills have to be attended to, they want special condiments for their  &#034;half&#034; of the order and those have to be fetched, they want more bread an butter (free) brought to the table because they realized they were hungrier than they thought...it goes on and on. And here you have it, a restaurant opens at 5pm for dinner, the 7-top reservation is at 6:15, so you can&#039;t seat anyone else at it because you can&#039;t be sure if they will leave before your reservation gets there, so those tables are tied up not only for the hour and a half the party will be there but an hour and 15 mins prior...and if it&#039;s a small restaurant, this really starts adding up...I hope you understand what I&#039;m saying here.</p>

      <p>Its the American sense of entitlement. Nothing is free. That plate has to be carried by a server. The extra plate has to be picked up by a server. The plate has to be washed by a dishwasher. The soap and water to wash the plate is not free. Everything has a cost. When I traveled to Europe I learned the hard way that nothing at restaurants is free. Ketchup, bread and butter cost me extra.

      <p>You&#039;d be hard pressed to determine the incremental cost of bringing one empty plate out along with the order and the tip usually pays about three quarters of your servers wages anyway, the cost of washing said dish is likely to be under a nickel..</p>

      <p>iv&#039;e  been a professional line cook for 10 years, and i can give reasonable explanations for everything on the list, but the split plate fee seems to be the one people understand the least, basically its this, first, you are taking up a seat in our restaurant (which if it is a halfway decent place this does actually cost us money) and second/ more importantly, if you order and entree (which is usually the only thing you&#039;ll see a split fee on anyway) and you want it split, we will cut the steak/chicken/fish in half and put it on two plates, but each of those plates will have the same amount of sides as a normal dish and this is what you are being charged for, if you want to avoid the fee then order one and ask for a second plate, this is easy and the server can get you the plate without us cooks noticing, potentially getting them a better tip.</p>

      <p>The people I know who split their dinner, already do so at the table; they aren&#039;t getting any extra vegetables nor asking the cook/chief to perform a special service.  Don&#039;t see how a couple splitting main course would be costing the restaurant money for the extra seat being taken by the person sharing the meal. Usually two drinks are ordered, and possibly two deserts ordered as well. This would be more than if just a single person came in ordered one meal, one drink, one desert and asking for doggie bag to take the extra food home, but took up the space of a table with two chairs, but only used one... the extra chair would sit empty until the single person left.</p>

      <p>Cadet, in your scenario I would have no problem with it, but that&#039;s never how it happens in real life that I experience on a daily basis. Yours is the rare exception and if yours was the only way it happened, restaurant owners for the most part wouldn&#039;t have a problem with it either. Those extra plate charges are a difficult decision for us to make, but we have to in order to keep the over-all cost of the meals down and still be able to give you free bread and free soup or salad with your entree.</p>

      <p>It&#039;s about maximizing profit. I don&#039;t have control of who comes out to eat.  If you need a table for one the best I can do is try to offer you a bar. If you want a table I have no choice but to oblige. But, If you need a table for two then I have an option to maximize our profit.</p>
<p>If I ran a restaurant that didn&#039;t fill then this way of thinking might be counter productive.  Each restaurant has different needs.  It&#039;s my job to address those needs...which will hopefully increase profit.</p>

      <p>Unless it is clearly stated on the menu, you can&#039;t include a surcharge for gratuity. It has to be stated up front before customers have a chance to order. If the customers were not made aware of the surcharge they have no obligation to pay it.</p>

      <p>They nickel and dime you to death. Everywhere, it&#039;s bait and switch. Advertise one price in bold letters and then add fees and surcharges for things that used to be standard until you double the price.

      <p>Except it&#039;s not. It is consumer demand that&#039;s pushed society into this model.</p>
<p>I worked at a hotel where we did this very thing. We wrapped it all up in a package deal and charged, say, $100 for the room. And our occupancy rates were low and people said it was too expensive. So we pulled back, took out all the amenities and lowered the room rate to $75. Then had to charge for the amenities. The Internet was $10 a day, the breakfast was another $8, the gym access was $5, the premium channels was $10, etc. In the end, the same room we used to offer for $100 as a package was worth $125 when split up. But suddenly, because the base rate was $75, people started saying the price was great. Then they&#039;d add in most of the stuff they used to get for free, like internet and parking and breakfast and the real rate rose to $110 and despite the price often winding up HIGHER, they paid it happily and occupancy went up 30%. Some people complained they had to pay for those nickel and dime charges, but the fact is that we used to try to give the same to them for a major discount and they balked at it. So now they pay more for the same and it isn&#039;t because we were greedy, but because they were cheap. They&#039;d look at the competition and ask why our rooms were 15% more, never taking into account that our rooms had all the stuff the other person nickel and dimed them for already built in. So to compete, we had to nickel and dime, too.</p>

      <p>This is so much BS. It is the cheaper hotels that tend to give things away for free. Hampton Inn, Hilton Garden both have free internet and breakfast, but stay at a higher end hotel, EVERYTHING has a charge. Forget about free breakfast or free internet.</p>

      <p>there is no such thing as a free lunch, or in this case, a free continental breakfast. those freebies you mentioned are most definitely something you pay for &#8211; it&#039;s part of your nightly room rate. as they are the less expensive brands, these chains can afford to charge a tiny bit more because they are still the cheapest game in town, but when you go to the higher dollar places the competition is tougher so they need to debundle everything to attract customers.</p>

      <p>True! Funny how you can get internet for free from virtually any of the lower-end hotels, but when I stayed at a nice Marriot last year it was $20/day extra for it. Tell me that it runs Marriot any more for their internet access than, say, a Holiday Inn Express.</p>
<p>I don&#039;t mind paying for things that actually provide a superior value (I&#039;d pay for breakfast from Marriot vs. continental breakfast from another place), but when the quality is the same, then what gives? It&#039;s like charging extra for windshield wipers on a Mercedes but not on a Kia.</p>

      <p>Nathan, that&#039;s not consumer demand. That&#039;s opportunism by owners. I do not believe you when you say that by charging more you are getting a higher occupancy in the hotels. That&#039;s B.S. corporate propaganda, and is designed to please shareholders, not those of us in the general public who have a brain and can tell which way the wind is blowing. You seem bright, but either confused about reality, or suffer from corporate indoctrination. Your post, while well-written, is wrong.</p>

how many travel web sites are there these days that find you the lowest cost hotel or airline ticket? thats how many people shop. lowest cost. they dont stop and think about the total cost, thats why people still complain about checked bag fees even though everyone knows about them in advance. instead of thinking about these additional fees as part of the price of getting what you want, all they do is focus on that one low number in making their purchase decision.</p>

      <p>If that&#039;s what you want to believe, more power to you. But as I lived through it, I&#039;ll stick to my story. Again, they wound up paying more than they did before AFTER the add-ons (which used to be free). Because they booked based on that &#034;base rate&#034; which was lower. That&#039;s what was in bold on the website and kayak and whatnot. All the rest was fine print. And admittedly, not everyone got all that stuff, some didn&#039;t get any. It could be a better deal if you didn&#039;t want those things. But most did want at least some of them and often the final price wound up higher than the original package deal.</p>
<p>At the lower end of the chains, price differences are minimal and thus not the motivating factor in deciding on a room. Not much difference in $59 and $65, so if one includes free wi-fi, it gets the win. At the high end they can charge for what they want and people willing to pay $300 for a room don&#039;t care so much that it comes to $320 with amenities. But in the middle range, price is a differentiator. There is a difference in people&#039;s minds in a $99 room and a $125 one&#8211;and free wi-fi or croissants aren&#039;t enough of a selling point to make up the $26 gap. So the middle band often seeks to lower the base price and then make it up in amenities charges. And it is because consumer behavior drives it that way.</p>

      <p>Bob, I&#039;m not denying that consumer demand is real. I&#039;m saying that the above example is not a result of it. It is a result of owners price gouging their customers.</p>
<p>Carolina Lawyer, you have two things going against you: you&#039;re a lawyer (which means you&#039;ve made a career out of being an untrustworthy liar concerned only with winning, not the truth.), and two, you&#039;re from Carolina (North or South doesn&#039;t really matter), so you it is unlikely that you have a moral perspective. I&#039;m an unabashed bigot toward people from the South. The biggest mistake this country ever made was fighting to get you back into the Union. If you ever want to secede again, I&#039;ll help you pack. Please make sure to take Texas with you. All that being said, you don&#039;t read very well, since I never denied the principle of consumer demand, I merely said that it didn&#039;t apply in this instance. The suggestion that everything that used to be included is now being including only with an extra charge as an example of consumer demand is something only a demented lawyer or greedy business owner could believe. It&#039;s just a lame justification for you charging more. Harvard MBA&#039;s and corporate lawyers have destroyed America. I hope you all end up burning in Hell for what you&#039;ve done. (Okay, there is no such thing as Hell, but there should be for such people).</p>

      <p>it is offensive to restaurant employees and owners everywhere to be put in the same category as banks or any &#034;greedy&#034; companies. i have worked in many many restaurants in my decade as a cook and every single one of them is full of assholes like you who think we are trying to screw people in some way, 90% of the people who work in restaurants live well below the poverty line and believe it or not that also includes the owners and management. i know restaurant owners who work 12-14 hours a day, 7 days a week in their own restaurant serving tables and dealing with customers who talk down to them, complain about the food and the prices, demand things for free and then don&#039;t tip despite the best efforts of an entire crew to please them. these kinds of customers end up costing the restaurant money. and the sad reality is that somewhere around HALF of the people that eat out end up being those kinds of customers. how dare you call them greedy, i am sure not every restaurant is the same, but in all my experience i have never seen one place that isn&#039;t full of hard working dedicated POOR people. however with all that being said, none of it applies to corporately owned chains, those places cook shit quality, overpriced food and they can all burn in hell.</p>

      <p>Some people get a special bottle of wine and bring it to their favorite restaurant.  It is the people who stop at McDonald&#039;s and buy food for their kids, then bring it into the restaurant.  They take up a table for 5 or 6 people but only 2 people order food.  Then they ask for bread, and butter, and eat 10 loaves of free bread.  And the people who ask for water and lemons, then put their crystal lite in the water.  How cheap do you have to be.  I can go on and on with the things I see every day at work.  More and more restaurants are doing coupons.  People want to use 2 to 5 for on table when it clearly says one per table.</p>

<p>I also hate when charged an automatic tip (usually 18%) and make a point of telling my server and the manager that I most likely would have given a larger tip (Ill tip 25% for good service) if they hadnt taken it upon themselves to tell me how much I should leave on the table!</p>

      <p>ok, in response...I work at a large buffet style chain. The owner DOES NOT charge gratuity. MOST guests ASSUME it was added to the bill if its the typical large group of people that we so often see. It&#039;s not uncommon for any server in the place to wait on a group of 30 and receive no tip. SOOOOO, as a server, I make $2.13 cents per hour and have t pay taxes on THE CUSTOMERS TOTAL BILL (7.5%). DO the math= 30 people at 13.00= $390.00   The gov&#039;t assumes I made AT LEAST  $31.20 and automatically deducts it from my paycheck...(remember I make $2.13 an hour) I PAID FOR YOUR GROUP TO EAT THERE FROM MY OWN POCKET. Wonder why some servers don&#039;t waitress long term? Wonder why the turnover is so high? Now ya know. Why add it automatically? Because NO SERVER should pay for the guests to eat somewhere. If a guest cannot afford to pay a tip, stay home or go to a drive thru.<br />
as for plate sharing, as a server I don&#039;t give a damn about that. THAT isn&#039;t something servers have any control over pricing/not pricing. I do the best I can to take care of my guests, including free refills on things I shouldn&#039;t, and an occasional to-go box to someone that I probably should. Please do not be rude to these folks.<br />
Waiting tables is NOT an easy thinkless job. It requires a LOT of planning and foresight and people skills (if it&#039;s done correctly). If you get excellent service, please tip accordingly. as a guest, you CAN dispute a gratuity charge on a CC if the server is bad.</p>

      <p>Your argument is misleading at best and completely false at worst. You are not paid $2.13/hr. You are expected to make up to the federal minimum wage ($7.25/hr) with $2.13/hr + tips. If you do not, your employer must pay the difference. Assuming that you report all of your income accurately to the IRS - and most servers under-report to avoid paying as much tax - it is impossible for you to end up &#039;paying people to eat.&#039;</p>

      <p>Who, then, ends up ultimately paying for it? the person that didn&#039;t tip to begin with by ADDING CRAZY SURCHARGES AND FEE,S and paying higher restaurant prices. Guess you&#039;ve never been privy to the books or owned a restaurant and YES, a server CAN pay for  guest to eat, especially if they have to pay TIP SHARE for a  table that didn&#039;t tip. 3% regardless, and it will come  out of the OTHER tips from guests that DID leave one</p>

      <p>I&#039;ve worked in restaurants and what they said is true. If you employer is not following it, they are violating federal law. Wait staff can be paid a lower hourly wage as they are expected to make &#034;commission&#034; on the meal in the form of tips to make up the difference. But, at the end of the day, you have to have made federal minimum wage per hour or your employer IS required to make up that difference. And that should be based on the tips you report (which you are required to do). Not the tips you earn, bu the take home, post tipping out bartenders and busboys.</p>

      <p>Think about your situation a different way. Let&#039;s say you work for one hour and serve one table in that time for simplicity&#039;s sake. You get paid $2.13 for that hour on your paycheck, but your employer takes tax assuming that you make $7.25. The table doesn&#039;t tip, so you&#039;ve paid tax on a higher amount than you&#039;ve made. This is bad. However, when you file your taxes, the amount of income related to that particular hour that you&#039;ll report as having earned will be $2.13, so you&#039;ll get a tax refund for it. Note that this scenario ignores the federal minimum wage requirement.</p>

      <p>do do NOT need to pay taxes on any assumed amount of tippage. keep a diary of your tips and pay tax on the exact amount. your employer may withhold based upon this calculation, but withholdings are not the amount of tax you pay &#8211; it is simply the amount withheld till you  calculate your actual liability. you may be entitled to a refund, or more likely, owe uncle sam additional funds.</p>

      <p>Yeah, you can dispute the tip at a buffet due to bad service but they usually don&#039;t fix it.  Just look at the folks who were arrested for not paying an automatic tip when they received poor service.  Tips are optional; if you can&#039;t make it up, maybe you&#039;re a crappy server.  But that&#039;s not my fault, so why should anyone , aside from your employer, be required to pay you?</p>

      <p>Where have people been arrested for not paying any tip?  Under what law in what city and what state?  Or is that an urban myth?   If you pay for the food, nothing has been stolen so it is not theft.  A tip, by definition, is up to the diner.  In addition, you can pay with a credit card then contact your bank to rescind part of the charge.</p>

      <p>As far as I know, there&#039;s only been one documented case where someone actually got arrested for refusing a mandatory tip, and on that occasion the DA &#034;recommended&#034; the dismissal of the charges because it was a civil rather than criminal issue.

not too long ago there was a story on cnn about a place in texas that locked the front door and called the sheriff when a group didnt want to pay the mandatory gratuity for a large party. when the cops showed up they wouldnt answer the woman&#039;s question as to if she would be arrested for not paying the tip, and as she was the mother of a few children who were with her at the time she went ahead and paid it under duress.</p>

      <p>Why would you be that passive aggressive about tipping? If you usually tip 25% and get an 18% gratuity added onto a bill when the service was worth it, then add the extra 7% in and don&#039;t be a whiny brat about it. Some places it&#039; a matter of policy and the people you&#039;re childishly complaining to aren&#039;t the people who make such policies. I&#039;d rather hear you bitch about how terrible tipping is in general than be whiny about servers protecting themselves.</p>

      <p>I&#039;m missing something. Is Raymond&#039;s a buffet style restaurant? If not, and you ordered your own entries, how could they charge you extra? You already bought that food, and can do anything you want with it. I understand a sharing fee if it were a buffet, but not otherwise. I&#039;m starting to think these policies are in place because too many people act foolishly, and pay for things they don&#039;t have to.</p>

      <p>Having worked in the service industry for many years, Let me say this. First of all, I am not a disgruntled employee. I like what I do, and take pride in giving the best service I can to everyone. Also, my employers bend over backwards to accomodate the needs of everyone to he best of their ability. That being said, there are some guests that they don&#039;t want back. It is possible to be such a pain i the butt, that they dont want your business.

      <p>So people pay a few bucks for fast food, toilet turds and then complain about condiment packets costing a dime or two?  Maybe it&#039;s time to reassess what you&#039;re wasting your money on.</p>

      <p>When I use to work at McDonald&#039;s, mayo was not a standard condiment on a regular cheeseburger; cheeseburgers came with mustard, ketchup, pickles and onions. So if you would go to a franchise McDonald&#039;s that charges for extra condiments, then yes, you would be charged the $.10 since mayo would be considered an extra condiment.</p>

      <p>At a pizza parlor one time I asked for oregano. The server didn&#039;t know what oregano was and asked in kitchen.  She brought me a few sprinkles of the delicacy and the pizza place charged me $1.50 for the extra ingredient.  I still go there once in a while for convenience, but order baked dough with melted cheese, tomato sauce, tomato, onions, etc. I don&#039;t call it pizza unless there&#039;s oregano (or basil).</p>

      <p>When I go to a restaurant with 10 people, we get hit with the automatic tip. But if it&#039;s busy and we split up into two tables, tips are not added. Same number of customers. Same amount of work for waiters. What&#039;s the difference that warrants an automatic tips in one case? I don&#039;t begrudge waiters the tips, but I want to decide what how to tip based on service.</p>

      <p>Because when the bill comes let&#039;s say the total is $500 (when in fact 10 people would be more than that usually) 20% of that would be $100.  MOST people are stingy and would feel that a server shouldn&#039;t get $100 for serving food.</p>
<p>I have never worked in food service but I feel adding the gratuity in is very fair.  If you don&#039;t like it, why don&#039;t you stay home?</p>

      <p>And lets say the meal was only $50, so that&#039;d be $10. Did the waiter at the $500 restaurant do any more work than the waiter at the $50 restaurant? Why should their tip be based on the price of the meal at all. Percent based tipping is frankly ridiculous.</p>

      <p>Unless you actually know what they did or didn&#039;t do behind the scenes, saying that percent tipping is ridiculous is pretty ridiculous. I&#039;ve worked in higher and lower end restaurants and yes, I did do a lot more at the higher end places&#8211;much of which the customers never saw. For example, riding the kitchen on my customer&#039;s behalf to make sure they get their food in a timely manner and even rejecting dishes not cooked properly. At Chili&#039;s, half that food comes out of a bag or mix made and sent to you from corporate. You get some lame looking chicken fingers then tough. That&#039;s what the pre-breaded frozen bag sent to us had in it. Tough. But at a higher end place where the slice and bread their own chicken, you can, as a waiter, send back unacceptable pieces and demand recooks on behalf of your customers. Things like that.</p>

      <p>That&#039;s because a server DOESN&#039;T deserve $100 for serving food. I&#039;m getting to the point where I&#039;m done with tipping on the bill. A $2 tip per person at a cheap place, and perhaps $4 or $5 at a nice place is enough. If I&#039;m sitting there with my family at a nice place, there are four of us, and we stay for about an hour. The server then gets $20 in tips. That&#039;s more than a private school teacher, so that&#039;s more than enough for someone that did not have to earn a college degree to get the job. While it takes people skills, and a fair amount of timing, it isn&#039;t a job that requires any real professional skills. $20 an hour for a server at a fine restaurant is more than enough. I hope tipping on the amount of the check is becoming extinct. It&#039;s a remnant from the era when waitressing was the only decent job a woman could get and support a family on. That era is over, and it is no longer necessary to provide a career-level income to servers. It&#039;s a temporary job while you become an actor, or go to school, or something like that. Times change, and tipping practices should too.</p>

      <p>i agree with godot &#8211; unless a server goes WAY above and beyond the call of duty, how can you possibly justify a 100$ tip for a large party? a dinner might last what &#8211; maybe an hour? even if the server was dedicating 100% of their time to your party (and they arent) and your party alone thats 100$ an hour. thats an effective salary of 200k$ a year for the time they are waiting on your party. is that really a reasonable expectation? thats why tipping a percentage makes little sense.</p>
<p>I have tipped a few dollars on a 100$ meal before because the bulk of the cost was an expensive bottle of wine. I have also tipped 20$ on a 6$ order of chili and grilled cheese because I got service that was above and beyond. I think this is a much more reasonable way to go.</p>

      <p>nathan, i know servers arent making 200k$ a year. thats my point. why compensate them for a huge tab as though they were expected to make that sort of $$$$ ?</p>
<p>if a waiter worked 5 tables in an hour and got 5$ out of each of them pulling in $25 for that hour &#8211; then worked your table plus 2 more in the next hour, should they get 110$ for that same hour of work just because it was fillet mignons all around? of course not.</p>

      <p>It actually isn&#039;t the same amount of work, big parties are a lot more. At a minimum, restaurants strive to deliver an entire table&#039;s worth of food at once. That means the kitchen has to coordinate what meals&#8211;and parts of meals&#8211;it is making when so that one guy&#039;s salad isn&#039;t done and wilting for 10 minutes while another guy&#039;s well done steak is cooking. Rather you have to start the steak and remember in 8 minutes to make the salad. So when you are at a table of 4 or 5, that is a lot easier to keep straight and coordinate&#8211;and to mix in with orders from other tables cooking at the same time&#8211;than a party of 10 which requires much greater coordination and can even lock out the start of cooking for other tables and add to other table&#039;s wait times.<br />
Additionally, statistically, larger parties tend to take up tables longer. Because the group is larger, perhaps, there is more socializing. So while a table of five may leave after 45 minutes, a table of ten may stay an hour or more. And waiters make money by flipping tables. If you and your wife come in, order $40 of food, and decide to tip 15% ($6), then your leaving in 30 minutes is far more beneficial to the waiter (who can get another table to do the same, netting them $12 that hour) than your lingering for an hour and still only leaving $6. Larger groups tend to do the latter. So the auto gratuity&#8211;often set higher than 15%&#8211;helps compensate for that.<br />
Also, large groups, especially when paying separately, almost always skimp on the tip. Perhaps people assume someone else down the way tipped enough so now they don&#039;t have to. Who knows. But having worked in multiple restaurants, between the coordination involved, the table time, and the lower tips without an auto-gratuity added...I&#039;ve yet to work in a restaurant where anyone actually wanted to take the large party that walks in the door. Waiters usually want to avoid them&#8211;except for the guaranteed tip.</p>

      <p>I&#039;d like to see tipping practices change from being a percentage of the bill to being a set amount per person. A cheap place (like a Denny&#039;s) can be a $2 tip per person. A nice place can be $4 or $5 per person. There is no reason servers should be making more money than teachers, nurses, cops or firefighters, but they routinely do in fine restaurants. That&#039;s just wrong. I can&#039;t justify leaving a tip based on a percentage for someone that just brought me my food. If I&#039;m in a really nice place, and the server is doing some table-side prep/cooking, that&#039;s totally different.</p>

      <p>Many people tip based off the total price of the bill. Splitting a dish reduces the bill and takes away from the tip. The waiter/waitress is basically doing work for something they wouldn&#039;t get tipped on.</p>

      <p>So, if the 2 people were going to just order 2 house salads, that&#039;d be ok.  But, if one orders the house salad and the other orders a filet mignon and gives a bite or two to the person with the salad, that&#039;s punishable?  As the author said, it&#039;d be understandable if the request was to split the entree into 2 entrees, dressed up and served.  The charge can be justified that the waiter or the cook had to do additional work for the same price.  Otherwise, you&#039;d be charging for &#034;you might have eaten a more expensive meal&#034; which is ridiculous.  Are you going to charge a person for ordering the cheapest meal in the menu?</p>

      <p>&#034;Doing work&#034;?!? No, the server is not doing extra work. The chef might do a little by plating on two dishes, but the server is only carrying the dish from the kitchen to the table. The idea of charging more for the same amount of food is ludicrous. If you split a plate and it includes additional sides and extras, that is different and should be charged for, but not if there isn&#039;t any extra food. You don&#039;t get to charge for every last little thing you do. Well, you can try, but I won&#039;t pay. See you in court.</p>

      <p>I was in Rome a couple of years ago and while walking toward the Vatican on the Via Della Conciliazione where there are many small restaurants, my wife and I decided to stop and get something to eat. We found a nice little deli and looked at the posted prices. A cheeseburger, fries, and a coke for me, 3 pieces of toasted biscuit and bruschetta for my wife was going to be about 30 Euro ($ 45.00) expensive, but we had a great view of the Vatican. We sat at a small card table with two folding chairs and ate lunch. When we got our bill, it was 50 Euros ($ 75.00). Remember, this was for a burger, frys, 3 small pieces of toast and a couple of sodas. We were told that the prices for sitting down at our table cost more. Lesson learned: Beware of eating in the tourist traps of European cities!</p>

      <p>In Italy it is customary in restaurants including coffee shops to charge a table charge if you sit down instead of eating at a counter standing up. Is is called a &#034;copperto&#034; charge.</p>

      <p>Ordering a cheeseburger and fries in Rome, Paris, or anywhere outside the US is simply gauche.  A large part of the joy of travel is sampling the local cuisine.   But a cheeseburger?  A cheeseburger?  In a city with wonderful food?  Sigh.</p>

      <p>I am not &#034;cheap&#034; because I don&#039;t want to pay $50 for a burger, drink and some chips. What planet do you live on? If they tell me the price beforehand, then I get to make an informed choice, and I have to pay. If they increase the price after I&#039;ve already made my selection they can go screw themselves. Why should I pay? Just because they said so? So what? Who the heck are they? Just because it&#039;s their restaurant doesn&#039;t mean I have to listen to them in such a situation. Again, if you tell me beforehand, I should pay. If you want to charge me extra after? lolololololol, sorry, not a chance.</p>

      <p>I just read a marketing book called &#034;Stick Like Glue&#034; by Jim Palmer that discusses this kind of managerial stupidity.  He points out that successful businesses look at the potential lifetime value of each customer, and treat the customer accordingly.  A restaurant that does that would never loose a regular customer over a $1 surcharge, because they would not be nickel and dimeing you to death to begin with.</p>

      <p>This guy is getting carried away by his own article.  Of course, the buffet restaurants should charge for food that is wasted, and no, I don&#039;t see a &#034;million&#034; reasons for not finishing every morsel, except in the rare case of a guy who suddenly got ill in the middle of his meal, or was forced to leave due to an emergency.  Without bringing in the orphans of Somalia who go hungry every night, commonsense dictates that while you are getting a good deal on pigging out, you are being served the food to throw it away.  Whoever is trying to show his &#034;class&#034; by leaving food on the plate should be prepared to pay for his high tastes.</p>

      <p>Buffets factor in to their prices that a certain proportion of their diners will take seconds, thirds, or more.  What if a diner takes one plate, takes a normal amount of food on that plated, then cannot, for whatever reason, finish it, why should that person be gouged?</p>

      <p>Anyone who asks for steak sauce deserves to get charged extra for ruining a fine piece of meat.  And if it&#039;s not a fine piece of meat, order something else.</p>

      <p>My father believes the same thing. I routinely tell him he&#039;s wrong about that. For you to have an opinion like that about how OTHER people eat is too stupid to describe. If you don&#039;t like steak sauce, fine, but for you to comment on how other people eat is both arrogant and rude. It&#039;s false snobbery, since some of the finest sauces can go on steak. I find your attitude to be plebeian and totally lacking in epicurean sophistication. (sticks tongue out at you and goes pffffttt!!) Okay, so much for MY maturity, but then I&#039;m a hypocrite. :)</p>

      <p>I used to love to go out to eat, but lately not so much. Between the spotty service, poorly prepared food, crowded conditions, and outrageous prices as well as fees for parking. I am choosing to stay home and prepare my own meals these days. I know I won&#039;t be missed. Also, I won&#039;t miss noisy restaurants, disappearing service personnel, poorly prepared food. Most of all I won&#039;t miss the prices, I can prepare the same thing at home for a mere fraction of the price and aggravation of going out.</p>

      <p>Agreed.  You can go out for a steak dinner for four and spend easily $100 to $120.  I can cook just as good a steak on the bbq with salad, baked potato, veggies, bread, cake, wine and coffee for $35 or less.</p>

      <p>If the &#039;Steak Sauce&#039; is a labor intensive bordelaise, I understand an upcharge. You have to emulsify bone marrow into it, and processing that stuff is a chore. The charge for a rocks pour I get too, because it is extra product the bartender is pouring. Asking the restaurant to eat the extra half ounce of a premium liquor is like asking the guy building your house to eat the extra cost of premium fixtures.</p>

      <p>What is the problem with measuring the drink before pouring it in a glass neat or over ice?  If the customer complains that he sees less in his glass compared to the next guy who had it &#039;on the rocks&#039;, then give him a grade school book on Archimedes&#039;s principle.</p>

      <p>As a restauranteur I am very intrigued with this blog &amp; your point of view.  On a side note, really love that you are reminding people of etiquette, there seems to be a loss of it these days.  My husband &amp; I have had extensive discussions about many of your acceptable &amp; unacceptable surcharges &#8211; as customer&#039;s we prefer an all inclusive price for our entree (including the side, perhaps a salad &amp; bread service in the price of the meal); that of course depends on the type of restaurant you are choosing to experience.   An automatic gratuity for parties of 6 or more should always be pointed out to the guest &#8211; we leave it up to the discretion of our servers (if they choose to always add gratuity they may miss out on a better tip, if their service warrants &#8211; but if they add the tip they had better present it to our guests).  When Joe &amp; I  sit down for our late dinner tonight (so goes the nature of our business), we will no doubt have a very interesting conversation over your blog post &#8211; thank you!</p>

      <p>It is just what you are used to, no right or wrong.  In a lot of restaurants in Asia, you actually pay for the hot tea and the rice separately.  Each bowl or rice and each cup of tea cost extra.  People are used to that way of paying and do not think anything of it.</p>

      <p>OK some of those extra charges do suck but I actually get the Meal Splitting one.  I&#039;ve done this many times and pretty much anywhere I&#039;ve done it, they did not just split the meal down the middle and serve it on two plates. Both of us got a full serving of the side dishes and it was only the main dish that was split in half.  Not sure the author did their research on this one. It sounds like one of those things they heard about but never actually looked into.</p>

      <p>We went to Rudy&#039;s Teller House restaurant in Silverton, CO and ordered an adult meal for our 2 year old twins and asked for a second plate. It was an empty plate. They added $6 to the bill. Nobody ever mentioned that they&#039;d charge us that amount. I would have declined and had them share the plate (which would have made a bigger mess for the server, btw).</p>

      <p>Does the restaurant specifically prohibit 2 year old kids?  Then, he is perfectly alright bringing his children AS LONG AS they are not creating a ruckus and spoiling the experience for the other patrons.</p>

      <p>2 year old kids in a 100% tourist town at lunch. Not an unusual sight. And no &#8211; no &#039;No Kids&#039; sign outside. And no &#8211; I didn&#039;t tip extra because a) they added a tip to the bill that they overcharged us on by $20 already, and b) they didn&#039;t leave a mess. Rudy didn&#039;t have a problem with the kids, except to charge us $6 for an empty plate. His problem was that he was adding charges to the bill because he knew we were tourists and didn&#039;t care whether we&#039;d ever come back. 20 years ago he would have been right, but today &#8211; too easy to provide feedback to warn others. </p>
<p>Why so eager to back a lousy restaurant? It makes me wonder about where you work.</p>

The waiter had been there just 3 days and told us that the owner was &#039;that way&#039; a lot, so for him to have that feeling after just 3 days...dang. They then added an 18% tip to the bill.</p>

<p>I&#039;ve been a waiter. This was a simple lunch order. We didn&#039;t even ask to speak to the owner. The waiter told him that the order was wrong, and he came out and started shouting that he&#039;d be adding charges to the bill for the correction (beyond the cost of our original order). The extra $6 for an empty plate was just the icing on the cake.</p>

Because people are doing sh!t for u thus they must be paid. If u believe in magic then the drinks will pour themselves and plates will clear themselves and food will arrive.</p>

      <p>You must be very naive of the world.  I have never worked in food service but I happen to know MANY people work as servers through college or they are actors/dancers/ etc....the hours in food service allow for flexibility and is fast easy money.....perfect for those going to classes or auditions etc....</p>

      <p>Surcharge, fee, fine, tax, nickle and dime, bait and switch, it&#039;s all the same unethical ways of robbing you of more money from you than you expected to spend.  I&#039;ll never dine in a San Francisco restaurant again after finding city surcharges on the bill, it make the restaurant an accessory to a crime of theft.  By the way, the city banned criminal background checks for it&#039;s employees.  Now you know who runs the city of San Francisco.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to consider food services as a profession when members of that industry post that they spit in food.</p>
<p>If you want to be treated as a professional, you need to act as a professional. That means doing your job the way it is supposed to be done despite how the customer treats you.  That&#039;s what a professional does.</p>

      <p>I really don&#039;t understand why so many people seem to be getting so bent out of shape over a surcharge. Who cares? Just look at the total bill, and ask yourself if it was worth it. If it was, go back. If it wasn&#039;t, don&#039;t. Why make your life more difficult than it needs to be? Unless you&#039;re the kind of person who isn&#039;t happy unless you have something to whine about.</p>

      <p>Not one mention anywhere of the disgusting habit of calculating or charging tip ...ON THE TAX! Yes, restaurants now present the bill total without telling you how much of the bill is tax (here in Houston, 8.25%) and then pre-calculate 20% tip on the total with the tax included (some require you pay the tip regardless of the actual quality of the service).</p>
<p>I do not tip at all when they do that (yeah, yeah, servers have to earn a living, true, but they are not required to do it working at THAT restaurant). If I wanted to tip my government, I&#039;ll do it directly rather than to a restaurant that never seems to quite get it forwarded on to Uncle Sam.</p>

      <p>Servers in Texas make $2.80 cents an hour. They&#039;re expected to make up the difference between that and the state minimum wage through their tips. If they don&#039;t make the minimum wage, then and only then the restaurant will make up the difference in minimum wage, but usually the restaurant will fire them instead. This can occur in as little as two or three days, and since lunch shifts earn less than dinner shifts, due to people ordering essentially snacks and generally slower traffic, a server can lose their job in as little as a week. Think about that the next time you&#039;re indignant about your tip being calculated for you on your receipt, something the server would have no control over.</p>

      <p>I did. A long, long time ago. And to be honest, Texas is one of the very few states that does this. Most other states pay their waiters the state minimum wage and tips aren&#039;t as critical. My point being that you&#039;re punish a waiter for a restaurant policy he has no input into is asinine, and how punishing the server for a petty line on a pre-printed receipt is not going to punish the restaurant that is committing the actual affront to you.</p>

      <p>Since you&#039;ve been in the trenches and survived the wars, I tip my hat.  However it is one heck of a business model to expect your customers to directly pay your employees wages and then fire the employee and hold the customers responsible for failing to make up the difference.  I have only ever worked in hotels where the wait staff have all earned minimum wage plus what ever arrangement of tips (usually 80% to the wait staff and 20% to the cooks/busboys).</p>

      <p>What a nasty attitude you have. If restaurants were forced to pay their servers what they made in tips, your food would be costing much, much more. I waited table tor 8 years, The 2nd time someone such as yourself was seated in the restaurant, everyone working the floor would  know all about you.<br />
 and would provide the service you deserved.</p>

      <p>Oh please!!   We have heard this cr@p pseudo concern from the waiters before.  &#034;Oh, your food will be much more expensive if you don&#039;t tip&#034; ... just imagine I said it with a heavy sarcasm.  You worry about your own paycheck and let the customers worry about the price of the food.  If the price goes up so that you people get paid fed min wage which in turn leads to no tipping, then we are all up for that.</p>

      <p>If the tip is not included, do you calculate the 20% (or whatever) on the total bill, or the pre-tax bill?  I&#039;ve always calculated it based on the total, which amounts to the same thing.</p>

      <p>The difference is marginal but people who raise it as an issue do so on the basis of principle.  Nothing else.</p>

      <p>Really?  A 20% tip on the 8.25% tax is 1.65% of the bill.  That is a mere $1.65 on $100.   Talk about nickels and dimes.....</p>

      <p>I have seen many restaurants adopting malpractices to shell out extra bucks from customers. Tandoori nights in Gaithersburg (Kentlands) charge rediculously double tip with different names like servce fee and gratitude fee etc if we use groupon or restaurant-dot-com certificates. Their entrees do not come with anything, and then they charge extra for every grain of rice or bread they serve.</p>

      <p>Two questions... why do you return to that restaurant?  Why do you pay those additional fees without protest?  Tandoori nights is cr@p!  Try Minerva at the intersection of 355 and Shady Grove.  It is a THOUSAND times better in quality and service.  Tandoori is charging exorbitant prices because of the location.  It could be justified if the food and the service were good.  When they first opened, I ordered a few very different dishes and I couldn&#039;t tell one from the other.  That&#039;s how bad it was.</p>

      <p>I do understand some of the charges, and have paid a number of them, but certainly not all of them.  One that I do understand but still disagree with is the automatic tip for large groups.  If they are going to do it they should never have it at 20%.  I could see 15%.  Typically for standard service I give 20% rounded up.  For exceptional service I leave more like 25-30%. </p>
<p> I have had many recent experiences when with my coworkers at a business lunch where they added the 20% tip, but I would not have left a 20% tip.  One recent trip we had 7 people, wound up being there for 3 hours, and didn&#039;t have dessert or anything.  It took over an hour to get drinks.  More than half of us didn&#039;t get what we ordered, and the waiter argued with one of our people that she had ordered wrong!  One person got ice water spilled down her front.  We tried to flag down the waiter and were ignored.  We were there at a prime time and there was only 1 server, but we were the only people in there, other than the hostess.  Now we know why!  Had there been a manager we would have argued the charge, but there was no manager and we wanted out of there.  The waiter had to add 20%, we certainly would not have.  </p>
<p>I have also had the experience when in college where everyone put in what they believed the owed and left.  As the last one there I wound up paying over $50 for a side salad and water because other people didn&#039;t include the cost of drinks, taxes, or tip.  That&#039;s why I understand automatically adding the tip.</p>
<p>I like it when the bill comes with tip guidelines at the bottom (i.e., 15% tip equals a certain amount, 18%, 20%, etc.).  I do the math in my head, but it makes things quicker, and there&#039;s no doubt how much you&#039;re leaving.  I would never walk out without tipping.  If the service is really bad and you need to make a statement, you leave a very small amount.  Otherwise it looks like you just forgot.</p>

      <p>Marge, I agree that hidden fees are awful but let me tell you my experience as a server in a  buffet type restaurant when they DO NOT add 20%  I customarily serve large groups of people from 8-40 and sometimes more. The owner of my business DOES NOT  add gratuity. It is NOT uncommon for the guests to ASSUME it was paid and leave no tip at all. So, now you have a server (and it&#039;s not just me) that certainly isn&#039;t going to do a  stellar job if she thinks she&#039;s not going to get paid....and YES, WE ONLY MAKE $2.13 AN HOUR!  So what is the answer?</p>

      <p>Some context in the timeline of this is needed. There was a severe tomato shortage in Florida due to floods a few years ago, and McD&#039;s was not the only one to either charge extra for tomatoes or to have the customer request tomatoes specifically due to fast food restaurants being primarily affected by this supply shortage.</p>

      <p>You should be ashamed for shorting the server that way!  It&#039;s not the server&#039;s fault that charge is there.  If you can&#039;t afford or don&#039;t want to pay a charge for your food, the answer is simple: Cook at home.</p>

      <p>Oh i get it. Sooooo instead of punishing the restaurant for the Policy you punish the waiter??? What you and Many people fail to realize is that the TIP does not go AT ALL to the restaurant. It goes to the server. The TIP should be based Solely on the service you received from the Server. Not on the dumb policy of the restaurant. If the restaurant has a policy that you do not agree with, then don&#039;t go. Its not the waiters fault. That&#039;s like going to a restaurant and complaining to the waiter about the prices. &#034;Oh this is ridiculous price&#034; Ok, so what? can the waiter change that price? oh so i guess since the price is ridiculous, cut it from the tip, right? even if you receive great service. Am I a server?? No, I never have been one. But i am not a moronic idiot. If there is something that i don&#039;t agree with at a restaurant I wont eat there, other than eating there, take up one of the servers tables for a good hour, complain about it to the server, who has NO say so in the matter but is simply doing there job, and then take the money THEY DESERVED from their income. Whether or not you pay for a tip does not affect the restaurant they already received their pay in full from your plate.</p>

We were able to convince the restaurant manager to remove the automatic 18% gratuity so that we could leave a tip that was more fitting of the service we&#039;d received that day.</p>

      <p>If you don&#039;t want to tip, don&#039;t go out. While I do sympathize with someone getting bad service, in my experiance, those that complain about tips being included in large parties are typically the people that are the reason that policy is in place.</p>

      <p>There is a very good pizza place by my house.  I love their food but they charge $1.50 to put fresh rosemary or thyme on a pizza as they consider it a &#034;premium topping&#034;  They also use such a tiny amount it&#039;s maybe 5 cents worth.  I stopped eating there because the extras were just crazy.</p>

      <p>And that&#039;s what it really comes down to.  If the customer does not like the extra charges, the customer can choose not to go to that establishment.  If enough customers so choose, things will change. If the extra charges don&#039;t bother the majority of customers, things won&#039;t change.</p>

      <p>Restaurants should probably spell things out more clearly. For example, if there&#039;s a problem with people eating 3 bowls of complimentary salad and then sending the food back or taking it home, set a policy and put it on the menu.</p>
<p>As for the customers... They need to realize that when they go to a restaurant, &#034;it is what it is.&#034;<br />
Don&#039;t like the music or atmosphere?<br />
Don&#039;t like noise from other paying customers?<br />
Don&#039;t agree with the tipping system in the USA?<br />
Don&#039;t agree with extra charges that are clearly spelled out?<br />
Then don&#039;t go to the restaurant. It&#039;s as simple as that. You can&#039;t just show up and expect them to change rules because you don&#039;t like them.</p>

      <p>I&#039;m with you, except for the noise factor.  Depending on the restaurant and atmosphere, there&#039;s an acceptable amount of noise that should be coming from any given table.  It&#039;s rude to approach or exceed that level, i.e., no yelling and screaming at a fine-dining establishment.</p>

      <p>At the bars I frequent (in Chicago), neat drinks definitely do have more alcohol in them than a normal shot. So (to choose an analogy that a person with the author&#039;s level of sophistication can probably understand), just like it&#039;s okay for 7-11 to charge more for a Super Big Gulp than for a regular Big Gulp, it&#039;s okay for a bar to charge more for a neat drink than for a regular one. Furthermore, anyone who knows what a neat drink is should be aware that they contain more, but even if you don&#039;t, once it is explained to you, how can you complain about paying an extra dollar or two? Oh... and by the way, there is no such thing as a neat &#034;cocktail&#034; because a cocktail contains more than one ingredient, so if the author doesn&#039;t even know what a cocktail is, how can he presume to criticize bar pricing?</p>

      <p>You realize that you&#039;re getting charge five dollars a drink at a minimum for what costs the bar/restaurant less than a dollar to make for you, correct? Restaurants and bars make more profit off of drinks than they do off of food, this is a truism known to people even who haven&#039;t worked a bar or tables. To state that you&#039;re all right being charged more for a drink &#034;neat&#034; is an interesting statement to make, as a &#034;neat&#034; drink doesn&#039;t contain any more alcohol than ordering it with a mixer.</p>

      <p>I am a server, and these extra charges are understandable.  You might try blaming this on greedy, cheap, and what can I get for free people.  We serve bread, not all orders come with bread especially if you get sandwiches but still they expect them and we don&#039;t charge them, same with jelly.  We also lose work hours because of food costs.  I would love to charge everyone of these cheap asses, its totally not going to affect my tip because they are not the ones that do the tipping!</p>

      <p>Clearly you&#039;ve never worked in a restaurant before.  It&#039;s understandable if your server is a total idiot and messes up your entire order, then yes, leave no tip.  But people who go into restaurants looking for reasons to NOT tip are awful.  You tip because your in a restaurant and these people (who are not YOU) are literally bringing you food prepared the way you ordered to your table.  The money you pay goes towards the cost of the food and preparation.  The servers are paid minimum wage and whatever tip they do receive gets deducted out of their already tiny pay check.  So what you leave on the table is what they go home with.  You can argue that when you go to Europe you do not tip, and why why why do we tip in the US? For the cheapos out there that loooove to cite this factoid, here&#039;s your answer &#8211; Servers in Europe get paid way way more per hour then servers do in the US.  They get paid so much that serving jobs are actually considered a decent and reliable way to make a living.  And to tip on top of it would be insulting.  But here in the US, that is not the case at all, and our country has a different way of doing it.  Trust me, I wish it was like Europe so I could avoid cheap unkind people who try to find any reason why they shouldn&#039;t tip.  What I love imagining is putting these people in a server&#039;s shoes for an hour and seeing how long it takes them until they cry and run home.  Sincerely, your Ivy league educated server who is funding grad school with a restaurant job.</p>

      <p>Another fun fact about Europe, or at least France, is that tip is factored into the bill. Some restaurants don&#039;t even make it clear that it&#039;s a tip. So they love American tourists who come in and leave 20% because they didn&#039;t know the tip was already added to the bill</p>

      <p>edpepters101 &#8211; Please enlighten me on what I have not comprehended based on what you have written in the comment above.  Your stance on tipping seems pretty clear &#8211;  &#034;I would love to be able to deduct a percentage of my meal due to inconsiderate staff.&#034; So basically, what your saying is you&#039;d like to pay less for your meal then what it is actually worth based on what you deem to be bad service...  Firstly, anyone who goes on CNN and proudly admits to be being a bad tipper is someone I think anyone could justly question his/her ability to &#034;comprehend&#034; what good/bad service actually is.  Secondly, your logic here is not accurate at all.  What does the food quality have to do with service?  You could have an amazing server and terrible food or terrible service and amazing food, but as far as your concerned, if you deem someone a bad server, you should pay less for the actual food then what it is worth?  That&#039;s like saying you&#039;d like to pay less for a burrito at a taco truck because the taco truck driver was rude to you.  As far as comprehension goes, It looks as if your the one who needs a refresher. Lastly, I don&#039;t smoke.</p>

      <p>it always amazes me that some people like yourself think you deserve to be tipped.  i have worked at restaurants when i was younger, and I enjoyed the tips I received, But I NEVER expected a tip, nor would I call someone cheap for not leaving one.  Not in public, not in private, and not online.  You tried to justify your feeling by saying the servers only make minimum wage, SO WHAT.  That is what the job pays.  When I worked as a server it was 4.25 an hour.  Yes that is low, No you can&#039;t support a family on it or even yourself, but I TOOK THE JOB.  I didn&#039;t expect anyone else to give away their hard earned money because I didn&#039;t make much.</p>
<p>The price on the menu is not just for the food and preparation, it is also for the rent, and the utilities, and the napkins, and yes the hourly wages of the servers.  I don&#039;t always tip, but I do tip regularly.  I tip when the service was good and the server kept in contact to see to my needs.  But by no means is a tip required, or automatic.</p>
<p>I have been to places that charge 20% gratuity for groups larger than 5, really 5.  Me, wife, 3 kids, anyone else and I have to add 20%.  maybe we are taking my Mom and Dad to dinner for a birthday... that makes 7, add 20 percent.  So i made two reservations for tables next two each other, the same server tended to both tables, and there was no automatic tip.  My point is adding a tip based on group size is rediculous. because you will still serve the same number of people, they will just be in 1 party, or in 2 or 3 parties.</p>
<p>Tipping is not a requirement, serving food does not make you a saint for doing so at minimum wage, it makes you employed. Very few professions are associated with tipping, and it is always voluntary.  But go ahead and keep judging people and calling them names because they didn&#039;t tip, or don&#039;t altogether.... because you are the one that looks ungratful, with your hand out demanding something more than the paycheck you work for.  Go ahead and try to make people feel bad because you feel the pay is too low, many of your customers know the pay is low, but you don&#039;t tip the guy at walmart for telling you what was on Aisle 4, and you don&#039;t tip the lady at the grocery store for letting you know the soap you are buying is buy one get one free.  Many of these workers also work for minimum wage, and work just as hard with no expectation of a tip.</p>
<p>Be grateful, but judgemental.</p>

      <p>Servers are often paid well BELOW minimum wage- many states have kept them at $2.13 per hour.  The tip is by far the bulk of their income.  There is virtually no other job where the customer determines the rate of pay so totally.  The cook is paid by management, regardless of whether food is burned or undercooked.  If they perform poorly, they may lose their job but they cannot NOT be paid for hours they are clocked in.  This is true in any job- workers are not docked pay at the sole discretion of the customer who may or may not &#034;believe&#034; in paying for services rendered.  Great!  If the guest is a doctor, I will decide to dock their pay because of the long wait in the office.  A lawyer?  They did not get me the settlement I wanted- I will deduct money from their fee.  Boy- this is really fun- the POWER!!!!!!!  I see why people do not want to give up tipping.  It makes them feel important.  Sigh.  Really?</p>

      <p>You can.  On the &#034;tip&#034; line on the card slip, just write a negative number and subtract it off.  The manager is probably going to want to talk to you about why you felt the need to do that.  But, if you have a good reason, then it&#039;s justified.  </p>
<p>I&#039;ve only done this once.  The manager listened to what I told him and then tore up the slip and comped the entire bill.  On the way out, he met us with gift certificates for a return visit which was very smart on his part because it encouraged us to come back and give his establishment a second chance.</p>

      <p>What would ever possess you to do something so disrespectful as to write in a negative tip?  Christ.  Why not, instead of being a sarcastic ass, just TALK to the manager.  But no, you have to make a big drama show out of it.  Provided the server didn&#039;t jump up on your table and do the Harlem Shake on your plate, I see no reason to ever go so far as you did.</p>

      <p>From my experience, a waiter or waitress who is guaranteed a tip due to the size of the party is simply sleepwalking through the service aspect of the meal. If he/she knows in advance that they will receive a 15 to 25% gratuity...regardless of their level of service...then, there is no incentive to offer great service that EARNS that automatic tip.</p>
<p>Every time I or my friends have encountered that &#034;party of six required gratuity&#034; language on a menu, we have asked the manager to waive that mandatory charge; if he does, we stay and eat and generally will leave 25% for excellent service. If he declines, we get up and leave and never return. </p>
<p>Simple as that.</p>

      <p>And why would that not just be factored into the price? It sounds like you work for a restaurant that isn&#039;t run properly. </p>
<p>If the owner(s) doesn&#039;t have the total cost of their meals, figuring in the &#039;extras&#039;, then they aren&#039;t on top of it. Thinking of charging for jelly is nuts. Personally, I just don&#039;t like surprise costs, and that makes the restaurant look cheap. If someone added $.20 for jelly I&#039;d figure they were hinting that they didn&#039;t care about me being a customer and I wouldn&#039;t be back. </p>
<p>The space, table, and utilities that I&#039;m using is factored in. The utensils and washing of them is factored in. The wait staff, cooks, and bus service is factored in. So to think of a piece of bread and jelly as being unreasonable when, from what it sounds like, that&#039;s a common request is nutty. Time to talk to management about upping the price of the meal to cover the cost.</p>

      <p>Folks, this is the age of the internet.  And, America is a competitive place, especially in the restaurant business.  I suggest some enterprising technokid set up a website providing comments from customers about eateries which have practices of charging for all these little extras that have been traditionally included in meals.  Quickly enough, they will likely disappear and go out of business!</p>

      <p>My biggest gripe is pizza joints that charge full price for toppings that I only want on half of the pizza.  So I want a pizza with half sauaage and half pepperoni.  They charge for 2 toppings.  It takes an extra 2 seconds to switch from putting pepperoni on the pizza to putting sausage on the other half.  And it&#039;s no more difficult to cut a pizza like that.</p>
<p>So I&#039;m paying for two full toppings...  Why can&#039;t they at least put twice as much on each half?</p>

      <p>My parents own an Indian restaurant in NYC. They never require nor get pissed about people leaving tips or not. Nor will they add an extra 20% for people who eat there. Especially if they ever see students eating there, they give them a discount and never take tips. Here in NYC if you go to eat some places charge you extra just to sit on their chairs. I don&#039;t see why I have to tip a waitress that gives me shitty service too.</p>

      <p>BEWARE:<br />
Charging a credit card fee surcharge if the customer uses a credit card is a violation of the VISA/MASTERCARD/AMEX card processing agreement with the retailer, and can result in the retailer&#039;s ability to process cards, being shut down by VISA/AMEX/MASTERCARD!</p>

      <p>It is not anymore, the credit protection act that just passed took that out from what I understand of it.  It&#039;s also caused gas stations to do the split pricing for cash &amp; credit that was popular in the 70&#039;s.  I suspect we will see more and more stores charging a fee to use a credit card now...all because the government tried to &#034;help&#034; the little guy.</p>

      <p>It&#039;s really just semantics, but credit cards cannot charge a fee for using a credit card.  They can however offer a discount for using cash.  This amounts to the same thing, but is a loophole that was built into the law.</p>

      <p>Visa and Mastercard settled a lawsuit brought by merchants over collusion in regards to interchange fees. Part of that settlement allows merchants to add surcharges to credit card users. Basically they can now pass on the interchange fees to the consumer. On a side no they have always been allowed to give a discount for those paying with cash.</p>

      <p>I like Buffets.. You can choose what you want.. Eat as little or as much as you want..<br />
If you watch, rarely do people take advantage.. I rarely see a glutton eat until they might explode..<br />
Many don&#039;t seem to even eat what they have paid for..<br />
Its mostly about just getting out and enjoying yourself..<br />
So I avoid the places that want you to eat and then get the H.. out.. And if you notice the places that charge for everything are like that..<br />
So why go to them?</p>

      <p>The bagel slicing thing in NY sounds ridiculous but it actually makes sense.  In NY there is no sales tax on unprepared food.  This is to help the poor buy groceries.  But there is regular sales tax on prepared foods.  So bagels at a bagel shop typically have regular sales tax, but if they sell them un-sliced, the shop can claim it is an unprepared food item and skip charging the sales tax.</p>

<p>The only reason we went to this place was because a friend really wanted to go.  The food was good, but their policies will discourage me from ever going back.</p>

      <p>my father used to tell the story of being invited to a political dinner (a presidential candidate) at the waldof astoria in new york.    this was in the 40&#039;s.   the cost was $100 plus .75 if you wanted blue cheese dressing.    comparing that to today, that would be $5000 for the dinner and and extra $5 for the bleu cheese.</p>

      <p>1) I never understood people who put butter on their steak..must be an american thing<br />
2) A fee for people splitting a meal I am ok with because most likely they will cheap out on the tip from the smaller bill.<br />
3) Certain substitutions I am also ok with because the ingredient you are subbing in might cost more.<br />
4) My college used to charge us an extra $0.50 for peanut butte or jam with we&#039;d buy a bagel, who awesome is gouging students?<br />
5) When I was in Europe I was getting random charges all over the place, I had a restaurant in Italy charge me extra for bread...for bread! a staple with every meal in Italian cuisine.<br />
6) No one likes lists</p>

      <p>@mattk, with regards to your #2, regardless of how many ways a check is split, 15% adds up to 15% regardless of how many checks there are. In fact, the last time I ate out in a large group with split checks, we all left larger tips than necessary simply to avoid needing to ask for change.</p>

      <p>He was talking about two people sharing the same meal. So the server will get a smaller tip because there is only one entree on the bill, not two. So, 20% of one meal will be less than 20% of two meals.</p>

      <p>@mattk In regards to your last comment about Italians charging you for bread, I experienced a similar matter while visiting Florence. I frequent Italy almost every summer to visit my family, and in most piazza’s in popular tourist locations, restaurants/bars/trattorias tend to charge more if you were sitting down at one of their tables (either inside or out) than if you were standing up or taking something to-go. It’s a commonly known thing in the major cities that very few tourists know (unless they&#039;re staying with locals). Kind of crazy, right? </p>
<p>I think the bread situation really depends on the type of dining location you’re in and what region. I personally don’t eat bread with my dinner (unless I’m having a quick sandwich at a bar), but I’ve been in restaurants in Europe where they do and don’t serve bread with meals. I think it&#039;s up to their preference or have some correlation to how &#034;touristy&#034; their location is.</p>

      <p>I myself work in hospitality in NYC. I can tell you what lengths people go to get get anything for free. This article is a proof of that. Unfortunately most guests take it out on the servers when it is NOT their faults and leave these hard working Americans with no tip. Managers and Cooks get paid salary or by the hour, servers make their living by tips (The $5 an hour barley covers their taxes). So when a classless guest stiffs the server, it does not send a message to anyone else in the restaurant except that server. It is a shame that NYC dining has become a waiting room for errors. People dine and wait for any little thing to go wrong so they can get out of paying a tip or try to argue a free round of drinks. It is as if restaurants have to pay for some type of &#039;pain and suffering&#039; the guests experienced during their dinner. And yes, it is easy to notice who the condiment hoarders are since they always start with &#034;I never do this but can I get some more? I am soooo hungry, oh my god I am sooo sorry&#034;. They like to fill up on all the complimentary items as much as they can to save a buck, driving everyone in the restaurant to hustle around for free refills and stop managers to complain after they had to wait for their third refill, and how unfair and poor service, and &#039;never again will I come here&#039; and &#039;I am going to go onto yelp&#039;, etc. I work in a restaurant with a large out door dining area. I have even had people become upset with the restaurant because they saw a roach OUTSIDE!!!! In NYC!!!! I will be writing a book towards the end of my career and fill it with all the excuses people come up with just to get something free or have a reason not to tip. There is nothing wrong with the restaurants, there is something wrong with your level of class if you can not just simply go out and enjoy a meal without complaining about every possible excuse you can find.</p>

      <p>Yes, there are covered by minimum wages laws.  They receive wages and tips (which are required by law to equal at least the minimum wage).  They do not receive salary.  In fact salaried employees are exempt from minimum wage laws, not the wage employees.</p>

      <p>I&#039;ve never worked in a restaurant but I can always see the scammers working on the servers.  The first thing they do is try to double up on any of the &#034;complimentary&#034; items like bread, salad, chips/salsa, etc.  Basically try to fill up on freebies and take the actual dinner home to eat the next day.</p>
<p>Then they&#039;ll make some unusual requests like &#034;extra mushrooms and cheese&#034; or bizarre customizations to their drinks that they are almost certain to claim they are unhappy with (Martini not dry enough yet they manage to swallow half of it).  The tricks are obvious, but what&#039;s a restaurant to do?</p>

      <p>Best policy is to have restaurant state prices and fees clearly on the menu. That way, customer is not surprised in the end. And as for tips, I don&#039;t believe in tips as a compensation for the wait staff. It should be restaurant&#039;s responsibility to adequately compensate wait staff. Customers should only tip if the wait staff has gone beyond the expected service level.<br />
ANd don&#039;t give me baloney about low wages and hard work. No one i holding a gun to you and forcing you to work in restaurants. If you think work is hard and pay is low then quit! Originally, tipping was to reward for outstadning service but little by little it has now become a standard fee. And at one time it was 5%, then 8% then 10% then 12% then 15% then 18% and now it&#039;s 20%!!. You go outside of USA and tipping in restaurants, cabd, and hotel is totally optional. And in US, there&#039;s a tipping jar at Chipoltle!! For what?? What did Chipolte staff do beside take my order? Why would they even consider having a tipping jar??<br />
Again, dont tell me low wages &#8211; it it&#039;s low wages, quit the job and get a better paying job!</p>

      <p>I agree that the business should be posting all prices and extra fees.  And indeed they should also be paying their employees for the hard work they do.  A little hard to leave a job in today&#039;s economy!  And actually TIPS is &#034;To Insure Prompt Service&#034;,   YMMV</p>

      <p>BTW, it&#039;s tip meaning gratiuty. TIPS (To Insure Prompt Service) is something wait staff coined. And as I said, if the service is above and beyond expected level, then it is up to the patron to leave a tip in the amount of his discretion.</p>
<p>As for the economy, everyone is hurting.I am a compassionate person and do care about well being of socety. However, at some point, everyone has to realize that your earning capacity will be directly related to skills and anout of effort you&#039;re willing exert.<br />
But more importantly, when we go out to eat, the business relationship is between the patron and the business owner. COmpensation of wait staff, cook and otehrs is not patron&#039;s business. So, any issues of wages and work difficulties is between the staff and the owner.</p>

      <p>HEY! Maybe I can start charging the cheapskates who ask for 30 lemon slices and make their own lemonade with 20 sugar packets and our free tap water to go along with their split sandwich and sit in my table for 3 hours while paying customers get turned away. And then go home and YELP that we suck because we didn&#039;t let them bring their car-sized stroller inside, or turn the AC and music off because you &#034;don&#039;t like it&#034;.</p>
<p>NOTHING irritates me more than idiots who have no idea how expensive or mentally taxing it is to run a restaurant. I get this all of the time &#034;But I can get this at the supermarket for $2 &#8211; why am I paying $5&#034;. To which I would love to say, &#034;go open the package and eat it in aisle three, then.&#034;</p>
<p>Our time and craft is as valuable as any other. A little respect, please. You would not ask a sales rep at KOHLS to take a shirt and change the sleeves from short to long, because you don&#039;t wear short sleeves. You would not ask Ben or Jerry to remove the nuts from chunky monkey because you can&#039;t eat nuts. You would not call up Peter Jackson to demand a LOTR with a little louder soundtrack, because you are bringing your elderly aunt along who has hearing problems, And you probably (I&#039;m guessing) wouldn&#039;t insist on firearms with &#034;child sized&#034; triggers at the gun range for your toddler. Or maybe you would. And also get really pissed when you can&#039;t park your hybrid car/stroller/suv on the dining room patio because even if it blocks all access to everything, it fits there and you should be able to. </p>
<p>To these folks I say &#8211; eat at home. PLEASE. To the others- I love you, and can&#039;t wait to see your smiling happy faces enjoying my food, drinks &amp; vibe.</p>

      <p>To be fair, there is nothing wrong with asking the chef to alter an item.  Either he will do it or he won&#039;t.  If he does it, it will be free or there will be a charge.  It&#039;s not a big deal.</p>

      <p>I found it strange that the author referenced an experience he had at McDonalds TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO,personally...but anyway,my experience there (which would have been two weeks ago),was that they will give you several packets of ketchup,but that the sauces they use,like for McNuggets,or salad dressings (which,BTW,they made smaller, as it were),they do charge you for additional ones beyond the first extra one.</p>

      <p>Yeah, KFC is the same way.  But I find the quantity of free sauces is correctly portioned to the food I ordered, so it has never been an issue for me.  I guess it would be annoying if you like a lot of sauce.</p>

      <p>I went to this upscale restaurant a few weeks ago and had a pretty decent time with my GF and a decent meal too.<br />
I got the check and something seemed off. It seemed a little bit too high so I checked the receipt closely and I saw that those Sons of bi__ches charged us $0.99 a minute for breathing oxygen. I angerly called the waitress over and she confirmed the fee. I paid my bill and stormed out of there and the waitress gave me an evil eye for not tipping her. A few days later when I checked my bank statement I saw that she went ahead and added a 20% tip to my bill and then I got charged a No Tipping penalty fee of 10%. </p>
<p>Man what is this world coming to!!!!!</p>

      <p>I dont know who you are but my family runs a restaurant and although we don&#039;t support the &#034;people&#034; you mention of that are cheap and It seems like it’s because you are a waiter/waitress as well. I also worked in several restaurants, I actually haven’t seen many people you mentioned in your comment but it’s not right when you are being charged for breathing air. What the waiter/waitress did is illegal and if you are supporting it then your entire argument is invalid. Maybe you should get a education so you don’t have to work as a waiter/waitress. I moved so far from the point where I was that waitress and I have never seen anyone that complained as much as you did. This is why you don’t deserve a tip. if you say waiters/waitresses make their living through tips then find another job. It seems as if the only place you belong is working minimum wage.</p>

      <p>99 cents per minute for air?  You&#039;re right, you really got ripped off.  The most you should ever pay for air is 50 cents a minute.  And most restaurants charge by the hour.</p>

      <p>Were you made aware of the charge for the time spent at the restaurant, when you sat down?  If not, you should have disputed the charge with the manager and refused to pay.  Second, regardless of whether I agree with your decision to not tip the waitress, I have to ask WHY you did not call the establishment and dispute the charge.  If you had called the bank or the credit card company, they would have removed that 20% and 10% charge which is NOT on your copy of the credit card receipt.  Did you strike out the area against &#034;Tip&#034;?</p>

      <p>With today&#039;s technology I don&#039;t understand why places will not split checks.  When I visit my sister in CA, most of the restaurants refuse to split the check... even when we went to the Cheesecake Factory.  The Cheesecake Factory that had the same exact computer system as the ones here in NC (where every restaurant will split the check).  The Cheesecake Factory that has check splitting built into the ordering system.  And yet they refused to split the bill. Why California, why?</p>

      <p>As a restaurant owner, I can tell you why restaurants dislike splitting checks. It has nothing to do with the technology or the speed of processing the sale. It has to do with theft. Many times, when there is a table with multiple checks, one of the checks will go &#034;missing&#034; at the end of the night. 8 people dine, 7 people pay and the one person will skip out without paying. This is especially true when customers have to come up to a register to pay. The waitstaff and/or cashier have to be really attentive to keep this from happening. It&#039;s just easier to say &#034;no separate checks&#034;.</p>

      <p>I stopped carrying cash as soon as I started getting credit cards in my early 20s.  The benefit that I see is that it is much easier to keep track of your expenditure &#039;cuz it is right there on your CC statements.</p>

      <p>Rose, that doesn&#039;t explain why such a large portion of the country has no problem with splitting checks, but a few places (like CA) seem to be completely against the practice.  I guess those San Franciscans are just a bunch of thieves that restaurant owners have to protect themselves against!  Or maybe it&#039;s just a cultural phenomenon that surprisingly hasn&#039;t changed.... yet.</p>

      <p>Not only have I never run into a restaurant in NC that would separate checks, but they assume the check will be separated before you even say anything.  Often the waiter/waitress will ask &#034;How would you like the check divided&#034; before you even order.</p>

      <p>The most ridiculous charge I have ever seen was in Greece (and they may still do it) &#8211; &#034;service&#034; which included the bread, flatware, napkins, and water.  Flatware and napkins??  I often wanted whip out a camping set from my tote and say, &#034;oh, no thank you.  I brought my own so please take off the charge.&#034;</p>

      <p>You will find that charge in a lot of countries, especially around the Mediterranean.  We have that cost in America too, but it is rolled up in the price of the food.  In many countries laws require that service be a separate charge from the food.  The logic being the server, dishwasher, busboy, etc are not involved in the making of the food so the restaurant can not legally include their cost in the food.  Other countries may not have a law requiring it but restaurants still break out the charge out of tradition.  Whether the charge is rolled up in the food price or broken out separately the total bill is still going to be the same price.  If you think its an unnecssary charge, its only because its an itemized charge you can see.  In America its out of sight out of mind.  Hopefully you did not tip American style.  In Greece tipping is not obligatory and done for good service, typically 10%.</p>

      <p>Oh, you&#039;re correct that it is a cost we pay regardless.  It just looks idiotic on the receipt and feels like I&#039;m being drachma&#039;d (now euro&#039;d) to death.  It&#039;s like paying $275 for around of golf and being charge $3 for the yardage card; charge me $278 for the round of golf and give me the darn card.  You&#039;re also correct about the tipping.

      <p>That cost is in most European countries and it is how you pay for your table.  It&#039;s a cover.  Should you stay the evening and monopolize that table, then you&#039;re good.  Relax, it wasn&#039;t that much.</p>

      <p>100X This!   I can&#039;t consume any dairy.  If I order a burger that normally comes with a fairly pricey cheese on it, why am I charged the same amount when not served the expensive ingredient?!  But if there&#039;s a surcharge for something &#8211; you bet it&#039;ll be on the bill.  When that happens, I tip appropriately and then explain to management exactly why I&#039;ll never patronize again, nor recommend the restaurant to anyone.</p>

      <p>I have over 15 years in the industry as a bartender/mixologist. In California, this IS an industry standard. Not an occasional rule, but a standard. If you order a &#034;normal&#034; mixed drink, it is either a 1.25 or 1.5 oz pour, depending on the establishment. A &#034;$rocks&#034; pour or &#034;$neat&#034; pour (this is how the modifier button looks in the computer interface, means that the bartender pours 2 oz. A $martini pour usually means a 3 oz pour, often for $2-3 more. </p>
<p>I know that the customer is always supposed to be right, but not in this case. This is just flat out ignorance and stupidity when they complain about this. The irony is that they are actually the ones benefiting from this, NOT the house. For example, let&#039;s say you buy a Johnnie Walker Blue label as a standard pour for $40. That&#039;s 1.5 ounces for $40 or $26.67 per ounce. Then you order a Johnnie Walker Blue label $neat for $40 plus the $2 upcharge. Thats 2 ounces for $42 or $21.00 per ounce. The CUSTOMER is getting a better deal. Obviously, most people don&#039;t order the $40 shot, but consider that most spirits poured neat are in the $20+ range, your &#034;savings&#034; will usually be in the 18-20% range by ordering the $neat or $rocks pour. It&#039;s math people. The math you said you would never need again.</p>
<p>You are getting 33% more product for $2. The only way you get cheated is if the product you are buying costs less than $6. If you are drinking a $4 spirit &#034;neat&#034; then you are some classy dude drinking Barton&#039;s from a plastic cup?!</p>
<p>Please use logic and think about what you complain about before you air it out online. Articles like this vilify people that are actually doing YOU a favor. #emperorsnewclothes #thinkbeforeyouspeak</p>

      <p>$40 for a shot of whiskey? I don&#039;t think so! talk about overpriced! This is why i almost never buy alcohol at a bar or restaurant. The markup is insane! I can buy a bottle of good liquor at the liquor store for what you charge for a single drink.It will last a lot longer, I can enjoy it in the comfort of my own home, and I don&#039;t have to worry about driving.</p>

      <p>Nope. Not high. Go to any bar and order a Lagavulin or Johnnie Blue or Remy XO &#8211; the spirits that are ordered &#034;neat&#034;. Although you might find these for $12-15 at a dive bar, any restaurant or higher end bar will charge $20+ for the shot. So many of you are saying that this mark up is crazy and that bars are ripping people off because &#034;I can buy a bottle for that price&#034; type of mentality. Once again, you need to be knowledgeable about the business before you draw your guns and start firing away. For simple minds, this is how it may seem. However, you must take in many factors and variables that go into your one drink. Many bars have live bands or singers as entertainment. Factor that into the price. One place I worked only used Riedel magnum glassware. We are talking about glasses that cost $10-25 EACH. Consider that you lose a percentage every day to theft and/or breakage. Factor that in. The nicer the establishment, the more employees they will staff. Get where this is going? You can&#039;t just say that the markup is ridiculous without taking in the big picture. </p>
<p>I think the lowest I&#039;m ever seen a shot of JW Blue was $27 at a beach bar in Hermosa Beach. Most establishments will charge $30-40. There are roughly 12-13 neat-shots in a bottle that cost $225 plus tax. So each shot will cost the house $17-19. They are selling it with a 200% mark up. You all say that the mark up is absurd, but ONCE again it&#039;s shouting out before you do the math. A 200% mark up is completely reasonable and a standard in every business. If you want to complain about something, complain about the restaurants that mark up their bottles of wine by 300-400%. #logicisgreat</p>
<p>Back to the main issue here. The argument isn&#039;t about whether or not you should validate paying $40 for a single shot. Hell, we have a cocktail that costs $500 on our menu that has Louis XIII in it. My argument is that many people, like this author, make erroneous claims that they are getting ripped off &#8211; being charged $2 for no reason. This is all a matter of semantics. If you order a spirit &#034;neat&#034;, you are saying to the bartender/mixologist, &#034;I&#039;d like this poured straight, with a heavier pour, and a $2 upcharge&#034;. There is no problem with asking for a spirit with no ice. You will get the smaller pour, and not be charged the $2 fee. This would be like buying a plane ticket and saying &#034;I want first class&#034;, then complaining about the price of the ticket. And your response would be &#034;I just meant that I wanted to be treated FIRST CLASS, not that I wanted to pay for the extra amenities!&#034;. If you order a &#034;vodka martini&#034; it is going to cost $2-3 more because you are GETTING A BIGGER POUR. </p>
<p>In your defense, it is the onus of the server to make this all clear to the customer at the point of sale. I&#039;m sure many stupid bartenders just say things like &#034;I don&#039;t know why it&#039;s more, it just is&#034;. However, some of us are not idiots and can explain the math and rationale behind this industry standard. My comments aren&#039;t meant to hate on people for not knowing this. My grief is towards the author who has exhibited pour journalism and didn&#039;t research his topic before he spewed out his opinion.</p>

      <p>Really, for a $40 shot, bar is interested in squeezing $2-$3 more from a customer for a 1/2 oz more alcohol?? If you&#039;re still wondering why the customer is complaining then you really dont know how to run a business.<br />
Here&#039;s an easy way to solve this &#8211; why not serve the same amout of alcohol as in neat as in rocks and charge one price for neat or rocks!!</p>

      <p>So Simple, it seems that your name is very appropriate.  Are you seriously recommending that a business give away more product for free because YOU (never worked there, analyzed the profit margins of said product, have a cost analysis spreadsheet in front of you) THINK that they are making enough money already?  Are you absurd?  If I went to a Best Buy to get a television, and said I wanted a 42 inch screen, but would only pay for a 40, you would say &#034;I&#039;m sorry, the 42 inch costs more sir.&#034;  To which, you are suggesting Best Buy just GIVE me a larger television because I THINK they already make enough?  I&#039;m really hope you&#039;re not teaching some form of economics class anywhere.</p>

      <p>With delivery charge, you&#039;re paying for the hourly rate (granted, sub-minimum, but still there) and things like worker&#039;s comp. insurance that the restaurant has to pay the driver (who isn&#039;t needed for carry-out orders).  The tip is to cover the gas to get to your door.  Maybe they should add the costs of the employee plus their gas into the price and offer a discount for carryout, but you&#039;re talking about an extra $5 to $10 per order when all added up, which is a little different than the types of charges talked about in the article, and probably wouldn&#039;t be received as well by customers.</p>

      <p>It&#039;s funny how many people are responding to this article with serious attitude and saying that they own a restaurant and have to charge extra for these things to make a profit.  I haven&#039;t heard anyone (including the author) say restaurants shouldn&#039;t charge for all of their costs plus a fair profit.  What I&#039;m seeing suggested is that restaurants should do what almost all other businesses do and include all of those costs into the pricing of their products instead of trying to nickel and dime their customer with extra charges on top of the actual menu items purchased.   </p>
<p>Also, the  &#034;It&#039; s my place and I&#039;ll do things the way I want, not the way the customer wants&#034;  attitude shown in many posts undoubtedly has more to do with why a lot of these owners are struggling than anything to do with costs of business does.</p>

      <p>Owning a business doesn&#039;t mean you don&#039;t have any bosses, instead it means you have more bosses than the employee does.  Every customer you do business with is your boss when you&#039;re the owner.</p>

      <p>Basically you are saying that you would love to pay 5% more for your meal, so some cheapskate can fill their purse full of condiments? Please think before you speak. A reasonable amount of condiments should come with the meal, any more than that is should be paid for. If you like to have lots of ketchup, you should have to pay for it.</p>

      <p>But the charge talked about in the article is for ANY amount of condiments, not just excessive amounts.  Also, I&#039;m not saying I prefer one way or the other, I&#039;m saying that looking at it from a marketing standpoint, less customers will be annoyed with slightly higher prices than surcharges whether you or I agree or not.</p>

      <p>As a professional cook, I agree with up charges for split plates.  Servers rarely plate food, maybe desserts, but in most cases all food is plated by cooks and chefs.  That being said, when we have 15 tables worth of orders and split plates come in, on top of all the other special requests we frequently deal with, it slows production.  People don’t seem to realize that the special requests they make add time to their wait.  It is never just one or two people that ask for something special, so we have to keep track of every nit picky thing people want.  Also, we don’t view the split plate thing as “sharing food.”  We see it as you being too cheap order your own entrees.  Splitting an appetizer or dessert that is one thing; splitting an entrée is just cheap.  My last job didn&#039;t even allow split plates unless we were slow.  The chef just told them no, and the servers brought them an extra plate.  The restaurant industry is non-stop, hard work; we rarely get complimented or thanked.  We just keep hearing complaints from people who don’t appreciate the amount of time and work it takes to put out their meals.  I&#039;m in the industry for two reasons, because I love food and enjoy letting people take a day off from cooking so they can spend time with people they care about.  This often requires me to sacrifice time with the people I care about and to work holidays.  So, please, give us break.</p>

      <p>Agree. This is the way I&#039;ve always seen this handled. At most, if one person doesn&#039;t order at all and wants to split with someone else, the item will arrive on its own plate, and two empty plates come along with it.</p>
<p>I have never once seen a restaurant physically separate an order.</p>

      <p>I have, and it&#039;s a really nice surprise.  They didn&#039;t even charge extra for it, though I would have been fine with a small fee.  It was clear that there were more of the sides than would have gone onto one plate, and the presentation was nice.  Tipped well that night.</p>

      <p>Believe it or not, at the restaurant I work, people do not want to separate their own sometimes.  Especially, if it is a difficult dish to separate like a lasagna.  They would rather the kitchen do it and bake each half separately.  I give them the choice to do this on their own for free or pay the share charge, which also includes an extra salad.</p>

When my husband and I go out to dinner with our sons, we often all share with each other what is on our plate and we all order something different.  It&#039;s a lot of fun and then we all can try four different things.  We just share amongst ourselves not expecting the staff to split our plates up that is just silly.</p>

      <p>Also, you get complimented and thanked by CUSTOMERS COMING IN TO YOUR ESTABLISHMENT.  If you think it&#039;s &#039;too much trouble&#039; to split a plate I suggest you not be in the restaurant business and stop moaning and complaining about what the CUSTOMER wants!!  Sheesh.</p>

      <p>Do you know how many times my wife and I have gone out to eat but neither of us were very hungry?  We went out to eat just to get out of the house not bc we wanted to go to eat.  While you call it cheap, I call it smart.  Why would we order two entree&#039;s when we will not finish them both- that I would call a waste.  Many times we order just 1 entree bc we are not really that hungry we just wanted to get out of the house, and neither of us like wasting food.  I will say though we just ask for an extra plate and have never asked for the cook to split the meal.</p>

      <p>I disagree about splitting entrees because we&#039;re too cheap to pay for our own.  My husband and I split all the time because otherwise the portions are too big for just one person to eat..and my husband doesn&#039;t like leftovers.  Even when we were on per diem and had $40 each to spend on the meal, we split it because the entrees were too big.  And no one has ever split it up in the kitchen.  the server always just brings an extra plate.</p>

      <p>Absolutely agree.  There&#039;s no reason why I would buy more food than I actually want.  Dani may think that her food is so awesome that just being there is an honor, but sometimes I just want dinner.  </p>
<p>If it&#039;s an occasional dinner out, I don&#039;t mind bringing home leftovers for the next day, but what if we&#039;re travelling?  When we&#039;re eating out every night for a week or two, the portions are so overwhelming you can&#039;t even look forward to it, and there&#039;s no way to do leftovers in a hotel room.  Sometimes we&#039;ll just order appetizers instead of meals, but in many places, appetizers are more like junk food.  Splitting an entree is the sensible way to go.</p>

      <p>Simple fact is in many restaurants the portion sizes are simply to large. I don&#039;t like waste and don&#039;t expect anyone to divide my food but it&#039;s nice to have an extra plate. I always tip as if we both ordered the same entree. $30 for the lamb gets tipped as $60 if I split the plate.</p>

      <p>The folks I know who want a &#034;split&#034; plate don&#039;t ask the staff to &#039;split&#034; the plate for them; they &#034;split&#034; the plate themselves at the table either by eating off the same plate or using one of those bread plates put on the table. They also don&#039;t &#034;split&#034; the plate because they are too cheap. It is often because the portions are just too large for one person, especially when ordering for senior citizens or young kids (like 6-9 yr olds) who want to order a regular meal not chicken nuggets.</p>

      <p>So it&#039;s okay for a restaurant to discourage you from bringing your own wine by charging a corkage fee, but it&#039;s NOT okay for a restaurant to discourage you from eating someone else&#039;s food by charging a fee for splitting the dish? What a dope! And yes, a neat whiskey should have more booze than one served chilled or on the rocks, and most sophisticated drinkers are aware of this (at least in my experience), so it is perfectly fine to charge more. Just like you would expect to pay more for the regular cut of steak than you would for the petite cut.</p>

      <p>I agree!! Everyone keeps saying it&#039;s not about the cost of the meal, they just don&#039;t want to waste food. So why the whining about a 50 cent or even $1.00 charge? And, by the way, the restaurant that you want to go to because you just want to get out of the house, or you don&#039;t feel like cooking or whatever is there to make a living. The owner has to pay payroll, insurances, utilities, rent, food costs, etc. If every table came in and sat for 2 hours over one plate, the restaurant would go out of business for sure. The server and busboy who need to be attentive to these customers need to get paid.  And let me guess, keep the free water refills coming!! Let&#039;s add the dishwasher&#039;s pay to this list.<br />
Restaurants are a BUSINESS and they struggle, more often than not, to keep their heads above water. The cost of food rises every day (fuel increases, floods in Florida, every excuse in the book) but they cannot raise their menu prices by much or they lose their clientele. The profit margin shrinks every day (minimum wage increases, insurance costs).<br />
So let&#039;s fill the dining room with couples who only want to pay for one meal. And not ask a measly sum to help out.<br />
Unbelievable.</p>

      <p>What? It has taken how long to figure out that Wendy&#039;s bases its burger price based on every burger having all the toppings, knowing full well that many kids will get their burger with ketchup only, but still have to pay full price for all the toppings.</p>

      <p>I&#039;ve encountered this, and I live in a medium-sized town in the Midwest, not in NYC.  One of our local restaurants that we recently visited charged us for extra butter.  We had asked for side of butter with our baked potatoes and were charged $0.30 per person.  This was a casual dining restaurant, and I was shocked, but I said nothing to the server nor did I deduct it from her tip.  I will, however, think twice about going to that restaurant again.  It just seems extremely petty if you are already paying $30-$35 for lunch for two people.</p>
<p>I&#039;ve also encountered two local fast food places (both chains) that do this.  I wanted a hamburger but to substitute a salad for the french fries.  Both places wanted to charge approx.  $1.00 extra to change the side.  Seriously?  A few bits of iceberg lettuce and a couple cherry tomatoes cost that much more than fries?</p>
<p>Other places do try to charge $0.25 for packets of sauce (like Honey Mustard or BBQ) if you don&#039;t order nuggets, or if you ask for more than the one you are allotted.  I guess that&#039;s better than begging for two extra ketchup packets or an extra napkin.</p>

      <p>The cost of a salad is at least double of the cost of the french fries? Why would you expect to get a more expensive side for the same price? I just don&#039;t get how people come up with this stuff. French fries don&#039;t go bad in the freezer. Salad ingredients do go bad. All these things have to be figured in to the price, or you will be going out of business very quickly.</p>

      <p>Couple issues with some of the topics in this article. First off, I&#039;ve been bartending for 6 years at a non-franchise Irish place.  We use a count system. One, two, three, and at three you stop the pour. As long as you&#039;re counting at the right speed, your pours will be the same in every drink, regardless if they&#039;re neat or on the rocks, or even in a mixed drink. We serve our neat drinks in the same cups as our mixed shots, whereas a drink on the rocks is usually put into a tumbler, unless it&#039;s a higher-shelf liquor. Same pour, same price, rocks or no rocks. Other places may do this because they pour differently. My advice is to take a brief moment and ask your bartender or server, provided they&#039;re not crazy busy. </p>
<p>As far as the gratuties go, for anyone who thinks 20% gratuity is unreasonably high, I suggest you consider what our wages are. I&#039;m especially lucky at my place, because I get paid $5/hr, which is more than double what most other servers make. Even so, every other paycheck is $0.00 thanks to taxes. My average check (when there&#039;s any money left at all) hovers around $40 -$50. When you don&#039;t tip, you actually COST us money, because we&#039;re still being taxed. My rule of thumb is if you&#039;re in a new place or don&#039;t know the bartender, leave a dollar per drink if the drink is under $5. Any higer, bump it up. At $6 a drink, $1.50 is still 30%, which puts you above the standard 20%. This kind of stuff gets noticed by bartenders. Doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;ll slide you a free drink next time, but we remember, and it comes back to you. </p>
<p>Finally, to the guy in an earlier comment who suggested &#039;we should get a job someplace else if we don&#039;t like the pay&#039;... It ain&#039;t always that simple, buddy.</p>

      <p>Lets see extra plate...somebody has to serve it, remove it clean it off &amp; then the dishwasher has to wash it which takes 3 different ingredients that combined cost $170 used in a machine that costs thousands of dollars. That&#039;s just an extra dam plate. Extra napkins cost money . Credit card fees run in the 1000s of dollars per month. Having opened multiple restaurants (all of which are still open) every single last penny counts.you have to include all of those costs into your menu items regular price so you don&#039;t look like a schmuck trying to up charge for credit card fees or extra plates.People on the outside think its easy money, what it is is a game of percentages, where expansion means employment and contraction means letting people go. Anybody trying to run a successful business let alone a restaurant knows if your not counting your pennies them somebody else is spending them, wasting them or worst of all stealing them.</p>

      <p>If you are going to charge me for an extra plate then I&#039;ll spend my pennies else where.  The charges you mentioned are excuses- is it really hard or time consuming for a waitress to bring another plate- really?  dishes are washed by a machine and I find it hard to believe that it cost or takes a lot of time for a dishwasher (making min wage) to add another plate into the machine.  Charging extra to bring out an extra plate is just plain cheap and greedy.  If you want to count pennies that close then just server your meals on paper plates.  How many people go out to eat just to hang out but aren&#039;t really hungry?  If you are going to be that much of a d!(k then many of us will find a different place to eat.  It is you who needs our business- as there are plenty of restaurants to choose from.  No way would I or any of my friends pay a restaurant an extra charge for an extra plate- what&#039;s next are you going to try and charge an extra fee for silverware too?</p>

      <p>All the extra expenses explains why $0.15 of rice costs the customer $7.95.<br />
 It takes the same amount of effort and water to run a full rack of dishes through the dishwasher as it does a partially filled rack. One serving is one serving no matter how it&#039;s split.<br />
Another pet peeve is paying extra for a child&#039;s serving. Again, it is the same amount of food whether the person eating it is 3 or 30</p>

      <p>It should also be noted that during droughts and freezes where tomato supplies are tight, there have been times when tomatoes cost more per pound than the beef used in the hamburger.   So sometimes there will be a charge for tomato on a sandwich or the tomato withheld unless you request it.</p>

      <p>It&#039;s obvious that the writer has never worked in a restaurant.</p>
<p>Extra charge for condiments in fast food makes sense.   People stock up on their own personal home supplies on the back of fast food chains.   Sugar and sugar substitute packets and ketchup packets are big drawers for people who want to restock their home supplies &#8211; and chicken nugget sauces.    People are unbelievable in their demands for nugget sauces &#8211; even for five piece ones.    Charging extra for some of these supplies is not bad business or improper &#8211; in my experience it discourages home restockers and when you train your staff to be able to recognize &#039;reasonable&#034; extras, you rarely have to charge for extra condiments &#8211; but having a clear policy makes it fair.</p>
<p>I also limited supplies of these items on the condiment stand so as to discourage being cleaned out &#8211; and believe me &#8211; they will clean you out of sugar substitutes and ketchup packets.     I have no problem with people loading up ketchup in the little plastic cups since that ketchup is half the price by weight of ketchup packets.</p>
<p>Restaurants operate on very narrow profit margins &#8211; remember we are dealing with the cost of food upwards of 28-30% of the total sale and now the cost of labor adding nearly that much after all taxes and benefits added.   In fast food you are happy with a 10% net profit on a great sales week &#8211; average of 5% when sales are tight.</p>

      <p>When Wendys first came to my town, it was not that much of a hit.  Their first unit failed miserably. Why? Ala carte charges.  I remember how mad my dad got the first time we went down there as a family.  We had been raised going about once every couple weeks to McDonalds and on most Tuesdays at A&amp;W (the real one).   A kid got a hamburger, small fries, and orange soda for about $2.  On Tuesday at A&amp;W, the coneys were 25 cents.  Dad would let us order as large of a frosty mug of rootbeer as we wanted but we only got one order.  But we could order three or four coneys.<br />
Ok, why did he hate Wendy&#039;s so much.  Well I can remember it like it was yesterday.  You ordered your basic burger then they asked if you wanted everything on it.  So your basic burger was $2.  Then every additional item was 10 cents.  So a $2 burger quickly became $3.  Dad got the receipt was absolutely livid.  We never, ever went back to Wendy&#039;s as a family ever again.  I did not know they had changed that until roughly 20 years later when I started going back to get frosties and baked potatoes.  Imagine the damage they did to themselves for that ala carte policy?</p>

      <p>As a former corporate Wendy&#039;s manager, that never was ever the policy &#8211; some franchise may have charged extra for toppings, but that was never a Wendy&#039;s policy with one exception &#8211; tomatoes.   I date back to 1981 and at that time tomatoes did cost extra &#8211; and so did cheese &#8211; when back was added a year or so later, that became an extra topping.    But I can emphatically defend Wendy&#039;s &#8211; that was never a corporate policy &#8211; maybe in some urban areas where costs to operate are outrageous, but I&#039;ve never heard of such a thing and I had nearly 20 years with the company.</p>
<p>I left Wendy&#039;s in 1997 and now will refuse to eat there because the quality and service is horrible and every product that I loved when I worked for them has been ruined &#8211; everything from the burgers, the buns, the frostys (which should never be anything but chocolate) to those disgusting fries.   So I have no reason to defend Wendy&#039;s other than corporate restaurants are run differently than franchises &#8211; I know &#8211; I went to work for a franchise for a couple of months and they know it all &#8211; they think they can do their own thing and they don&#039;t even follow procedures that I knew like the back of my hand (I was a training store manager).</p>

      <p>To answer the &#034;why charge extra for catsup but not for mustard or mayo,&#034; obviously the answer is that mustard and mayo are not a vegetable.  Remember?  Reagan&#039;s wonderfully brilliant administration declared catsup a &#039;vegetable&#039; for the purposes of claiming that school lunches were &#039;balanced nutrition.&#039;  As for other fees.....I think charging for tap water is the most clsssless thing listed here.  Steak sauce?  Really??  In our country for most people in most places, steak sauce sort of comes &#034;with&#034; whether you use it or not, so to charge extra for someone to have the option seems miserly.  If restaurants would offer acceptable portion sizes, people wouldn&#039;t have to split an entree. Perhaps if they offered &#034;half size&#034; as an option (at somewhat more than half the cost of &#034;full-sized&#034; most people would simply order that.  Fee built in, nobody feels ripped off.  And  $20 for corkage? OMFG thats half the price of a bottle (ok, I&#039;m cheap on wine &#8211; $40 is about the norm for me when eating out, although for a special occasion I&#039;ll go as high as $200)</p>

      <p>A really good sushi buffet in Va. Beach does the fee for leftovers idea.  I honestly thought it was a great idea.  Encouraged people to take what they will eat.  Anything left over was simply weighed at the end and a nominal fee was charged.  It also kept the cost of enterance to 12.95/person for some really good sushi.</p>

      <p>It&#039;s a good idea, especially for those of us raised on the unhealthy standard of the &#034;clean plate club.&#034;  But many sushi bars simply charge by the number of dishes when you&#039;re done &#8211; so you pay for it whether you eat it or not. I would think this is ample financial motivation, without penalizing you additionally if you realize you can&#039;t finish what you took (and what is therefore not fit for others/recycling).  don&#039;t they keep a barn cat in the back alley?</p>

      <p>Most sushi buffets charge for uneaten rice.  Because otherwise some people would eat loads of the fish only, which would far exceed the price of the buffet.  I understand and agree with this.  I don&#039;t agree with weighing your leftover plate and forcing you to pay extra, especially if it&#039;s not strictly sushi.</p>

      <p>This is easy. Charge more across the board for each meal and give &#034;free&#034; food (and plates) away. </p>
<p>This makes one look generous. </p>
<p>Or charge for each added item. This is more fair since the the desirer pays for the item, but feels stingier. </p>
<p>Two things make people upset easily. Money and food (when they are hungry). Poor restaurants get hit twice.</p>
<p>In my experience, the more troublesome people are worst tippers. They make the entire dinning experience retched. If someone starts with whining about this that and the other, prepare yourself to get stiffed. </p>
<p>These folk live to complain. It is their job. You cannot fix them, so it is best not to try. Since they will demand all of your attention taking you away from other guests, it is best to ignore them as much as possible. This makes their job easier too since they have more to complain about. </p>
<p>Have a code amongst management and waitstaff for these nightmares. Code Mixed nuts, for example. Then everyone knows the game, and discourage these people from coming back. They only take. </p>
<p>Don&#039;t be afraid to ask them to leave; your going to lose the price of a meal very likely anyway.</p>

      <p>I disagree completely with the writer&#039;s assertion that credit card processing fees should not be the customer&#039;s concern. In fact these fees are killing small businesses especially on items where profit is already low. The customer should have to pay the fees their own damn selves.</p>

      <p>It&#039;s called charging more. Most companies that do mostly credit card transactions build it into the price of their goods. What I&#039;d like to see is a discount for using cash. Some places do that, but most don&#039;t. I use cash where there&#039;s a discount. I use my debit card as a credit card where there isn&#039;t.</p>

      <p>There are costs for processing cash (loss, counting, armored car) and checks, but it&#039;s not as easy for the business to quantify.  Also most card processing agreements prohibit charging more to use the card.</p>

      <p>But they don&#039;t prohibit an owner from figuring $X average CC charges per month divided by Y average individual menu items  sold per month (which is likely well less than one dollar if not pennies per individual menu item in all but the most expensive restaurants) and adding that to the menu pricing.  Either way the extra amount gets added to the check, but customers are much less likely to notice and complain about this method than they are a special  surcharge.</p>

      <p>But more importantly, the wait staff shouldn&#039;t pay the credit card fees, which is all too often what happens.  The restaurant collects tips in the form of credit card promises and then subtracts the credit fees from the tip side of the check instead of the cost side of the check.  </p>
<p>As a consumer, you should write &#034;cash&#034; in the tip line of the credit form and then tip cash.  Leaves the restaurant to pay the credit card charge and also apply their formula to what the server should be taxed.  As a customer, I always tip big and in cash to insure my server gets 100% of the tip and the employer has no friggin&#039; clue as to what I tipped.</p>

      <p>charging the consumer the credit card fee could have benefits- like making the consumer aware that it cost money to use that card and perhaps more people would revert back to cash instead of spending that extra fee.  I doubt it would have a big impact, but anything that keeps people from using plastic rather than cash is a good thing.  Just think of how many people are still paying interest on that cheeseburger they ate 4 months ago.</p>

      <p>lots of places actually make the servers pay for credit card fees.  the system automatically takes a percentage of credit card tips out on the checkout.  another reason not tipping actually causes servers to lose money.  especially on takeout orders.  if you&#039;re tipping out based on sales, you get hit there on togo orders who don&#039;t tip.  then, if they pay with a credit card.  then the time and effort it takes to put everything together...  be nice to your servers.  they see some of the worst in society on a nightly basis, and many states do only pay $2.13.  that includes, in many cases, taking out your garbage, cleaning the bathroom after you pee on the seat/floor, having disgusting fluids splashed into their faces...  some of you people are really unbelievable.</p>

      <p>We get that it is a bad system.  But, the question is if it is such a bad system why are people working in/with it?  If the credit card fees are being taken out of the tip, then the employer is screwing the workers.  Why should the customers step in to compensate for that?  Now you want people to tip on &#034;to go&#034; orders?  How about people just come by, on their way home, to give money to the waitstaff, huh?</p>
<p>- $2.13 wage<br />
- taxes held on an assumed 20% tip on the total sales<br />
- 7% automatic tip-out to the bussers<br />
- credit card fees being taken out of the tip amount<br />
- no overtime pay<br />
.<br />
.<br />
. the list goes on...</p>
<p>WHY do you work in this profession??  Fight the system, fight the employer but don&#039;t demand that the customers take care of you.  The customer has an agreement with the establishment to pay the cost of the food and the tax.  That&#039;s it.  Rest, such as the tip %, manner of tip payment, tip on the check amount or pre-tax, no tip on to-go orders etc are at the DISCRETION of the customer.</p>

      <p>Why do people work at jobs with low pay and difficult conditions?  Because the economy has been poor and there is a great deal of competition for better paying jobs.  Because they are in the process of training for better paying jobs.  Because they are juggling caring for children or parents and this is the best they can do right now.  Because this is the skill level they are at this point in time.  I hope there is a sense of compassion for those who did not have the fortune of families who encouraged college or advanced training (and often supported it financially) or those whose circumstances  are what they are.  There but for the grace go I.  Social responsibility is a concern when others pay is very low and we are benefiting.  Sometimes people just make bad choices.  Haven&#039;t we all?</p>

      <p>You are off on a tangent!  This is not about customers being condescending toward the waitstaff.  I don&#039;t care if my waiter has a double PhD.  This profession is NOT one where you can/should hope to make a 100K.  The problem is that many take the job with the notion that 20% is a guarantee.  Let the establishments pay them a decent wage and pass it as a cost to the customers.  I&#039;m sure it will be lot less than the 20% of the check amount.  So far, no one has been able to give a rational answer as to why it should be a climbing percentage or that it should even be a percentage.  Anyone who screws up their nose at a, say 15% tip on a $100 check is the one who is creating a bad name for all in that profession.  Waiting IS a real job.  It is just NOT a high paying job nor should it be.</p>

      <p>The point is not that we shouldn&#039;t be compassionate towards less fortunate individuals.  The issue here is that just one seemingly low paying, tough profession alone cannot be nursed by other people.  Compassion is one thing and demand that you pay a certain amount because they took a low paying job is another.  The waitstaff complain about how bad it is with the job, the employer, the IRS etc.  But, instead of fighting with them for a change, they are pushing the customers to compensate.  I&#039;m all for better wages i.e. fed min wage regardless of the tip that people give them.  If paying them fed min wage pushes the price of the food, so be it.  But, it cannot be &#034;they don&#039;t pay me well.  So, you HAVE TO pay me at least 20% of the check amount&#034;.  That&#039;s ridiculous.  Social responsibility should be towards ALL people whose wages are low and are providing a service.  So, let&#039;s start tipping McDonald&#039;s workers, the garbage collectors, the street sweepers etc.  I&#039;m sure garbage collection is much more strenuous a job.</p>

      <p>actually, i dont have a problem with buffet charging extra.  you can eat as much as you want but do not just throw food away because you think it is your right to do so.  get a life.</p>

      <p>I HATE mayonnaise. I explicitly asked that my sandwich NOT have mayonnaise. It came with mayonnaise. (I don&#039;t even like the smell.) Okay, it happens. I nicely asked for two new slices of white bread. They came. Charge: 30 cents. Okay, I took the mayonnaisey pieces of bread and left them face down on the table. Not a graceful moment, but really? 30 cents?</p>

      <p>On the second thought, they can charge extra for anything they want. The question is if it is good for business. If the restaurant wants return business, I can&#039;t imagine it would be worth their while to annoy customers with petty charges. On the other hand, I don&#039;t think a fast food place on a busy street, or a hotel in Vegas  cares about return business, so they would charge you for ketchup, napkins and a glass of water, because the idea is to siphon as much money out of you as possible on your one an only visit there.</p>

      <p>In most countries pay restrooms are well-worth the charge.  They are clean, even sparkling, well-lighted, and convenient.  When I was a boy the train station in my town had pay toilets.  It is not a new idea, and not one that has never been tried in the U.S.</p>

      <p>You have no idea what you are saying, obviously. At least, that&#039;s what I&#039;m hoping and that it&#039;s just your lack of understanding of how the restaurant industry works that has led you to post such a cruel and miserly statement. Servers make 2.13 an hour and work their asses off to please their &#034;guests&#034; so they can use that 20 percent that you OWE them for rent, groceries, tuition, children, or whatever other expenses that that person might have. As for getting another job if they don&#039;t like it, look around at the unemployment rate; look around at the people living off government handouts instead of working at all. Is that what servers should do? Don&#039;t be a fool. Restauarnt employees are some of the hardest working people around. Sure, there are always exceptions to the rule. Not all doctors and lawyers work hard enough for what they are paid, either, but we don&#039;t stiff them. You should be ashamed of yourself. If you&#039;ve ever gotten bad service in a restaurant, it&#039;s because a jackass like you came in just before you, jackass, and ruined your servers day. Now you know. Ps. Almost every server and bartender I have ever known was also a student and needed a flexible job that offered mostly evening hours to work around busy class schedules. They work hard, much harder than you have probably ever worked in your life, and they DESERVE 20 percent or MORE. Don&#039;t be a fool and spread your foolish words. And, until you learn how to take care of people, you aren&#039;t welcome in ANY restaurant. Cook for yourself, you lazy jackass.</p>

      <p>Ahh..  another misguided fool, I see.  No one OWES the waiter 20% for the rent, groceries etc.  I agree that they are very hard working but so are many in other professions.  Just because those people aren&#039;t customer facing, it doesn&#039;t mean that they deserve any less.  So, if the establishment wants to pay them a higher wage and jack up the food prices, sure, let them go for it.  The customer&#039;s contract is with the establishment.  It is NOT with the waiter.  So, if the customer covers the check amount, including the taxes, then he has upheld his part of the contract and therefore doesn&#039;t have to stay home and cook for himself/herself.  Anything beyond the check amount is charity and it has to be at the discretion of the customer.  That said, the customer is not superior and the waiter inferior because of the said business relationship between the two.  The customer should not and doesn&#039;t get to treat the waitstaff badly.</p>
<p>So, either champion for the employers to pay the waitstaff the fed. min. wage or have the establishment tack on a 20% &#034;seated&#034; surcharge or have them display a notice at the door that unless the customer is willing to pay 20% tip, he/she is not welcome.  Otherwise, I say that you should be quiet.</p>

      <p>No, contrary to what the author says, surcharge for bread and butter is not justified, and it hurts restaurant business. Sure, bread costs money, but its $3 tops for a whole three-foot long baguette if you buy retail, whereas the restaurant will charge you this amount for three-four two-inch  slices. So, the customers feel gouged and won&#039;t return and rightly so.</p>

      <p>When we were given the wrong meal (both my wife and I) at Rudy&#039;s Teller House restaurant in Silverton, CO they brought out a second dish..then proceeded to charge us for both the incorrect one and the correct one. The owner came out (without us asking &#8211; he wasn&#039;t present when we ordered) and proceeded to tell us that we needed to order correctly next time, and he would be charging us the full amount for both. When I replied he walked away and flipped me off. Then...they added 18% tip to the ticket...then they added $6 for an empty plate that my twins used to split the adult meal that we got for them (just an empty plate with the meal). </p>
<p>I&#039;ve been a waiter. That was a crazy bad experience. I feel sorry for the employees that are there and for anyone that is unlucky enough to find their way into the store. I paid cash so he couldn&#039;t rip us off any more by overcharging our card...that&#039;s how bad it was.</p>

      <p>I was ticked off enough that I posted reviews everywhere I could think of. So rude, and to think the owner is the one that was acting like that. I confirmed with the waiter that he was the owner because I just couldn&#039;t believe it. What really ticked me off is he came out when we had the meal corrected and I thought he was just coming out to see if everything was alright...then he started with a chip on his shoulder addressing my wife! I nearly voted with my foot in another way. It&#039;s when I stood up to talk to him that he walked away and flipped me off.</p>

      <p>I would have refused to pay for the incorrect order and had him call the police if he insisted.  You were well within your rights to not pay for their mistake.  Also, hopefully you immediately contacted your credit card company to dispute the charges.  Finally, let&#039;s hope your online posts lead to this restaurant&#039;s failure.  I also worked as a waiter many years ago and have traveled all over the country on business over the past 30 years eating in everything from dives to 5 star legendary restaurants.

      <p>Customers ultimately determine the efficacy of policies &#8211; if you are mistreated then you should never go back.   Even if you did order the wrong thing or forgot, a proficient restaurant will want your repeat business and will seek to earn it by not treating you like you were treated.    How a wrong order is handled by staff tells you a lot about how a restaurant is run &#8211; and if they&#039;ll screw you and blame you (even if it really was your fault), just imagine how their procedures for food safety!</p>

      <p>Wife and I were at Las Vegas at a Wolfgang Pucks eatery. I expected to spend around a hundred. When I ordered salad they gave me a plate with two pieces of long lettuce at a cost of $18!  I&#039;m talking two leafs!  I about blew a head gasket and told them to take if off the order. Rediculous pricing...as much as some hotels charging $12 for two eggs? Okay it was delivered to the room and the TIP?  How much would you tip? $5?  Absolutely crazy pricing.</p>

      <p>I have to take the other side here.  If you ordered something without understanding what you were getting you should pay for it.  I&#039;ve gone to many restaurants with menus that have minimal quantity &#8211; that doesn&#039;t mean I refuse to pay for what I order.  Which one of Wolfgang&#039;s restaurants set you off?  I&#039;ve been to most of his in Las Vegas and have had great experiences.  In June I hosted a group of 4 at a steakhouse for about a $700 bill (including 20% tip).  In my opinion, if you aren&#039;t willing to pay for the restaurant or accept their offerings don&#039;t bother to go.  You actions, after agreeing to order the salad at the list price, was absolutely unacceptable!</p>

      <p>On a recent trip, we were charged for the lemon we asked to be added to our ice water.  I can understand if people pile up a plate at a buffet and walk away without eating it.  Charge a per pound  price for it and send it home with people.  Waste not, want not.</p>

      <p>You&#039;re better off without the lemon, anyway.  They drop the lemons on the dirty floor, then cut them up and put them in your drink.  Eew.  In fact, I&#039;ve seen too many episodes of Restaurant Impossible to even get ice in my water.</p>

      <p>I don&#039;t eat regularly at restaurants, however, I want to know what I am being charged. The menu should indicated the extra charges in clear concise and readable language. The worst was when I was charged a 20% tip without anywhere on the restaurant or menu indicating that extra charge. By mistake I added another 20% tip; I took them to court and made them pay a fine, court costs and other expenses.<br />
Again, ONCE I KNOW WHAT I AM BEING CHARGED, IT IS UP TO ME TO DECIDE WHETHER I WANT TO PATRONIZE THE ESTABLISHMENT, HIDE A CHARGE AND YOU WILL BE TOAST.</p>

      <p>wow how cheap and petty are you to do this?!  I mean REALLY!!! Were you that clueless to not understand a tip was added?  You should have had an idea about what it cost and noticed the additional fees.  Then you shouldn&#039;t have added an additional tip.

      <p>Good for you HW!  And, Your Server &amp; Alan should get off of their high horses.  If HW had approached the establishment, asked for the additional 20% to be refunded and if they had agreed, everything would have been fine.  If the customer made a mistake, then the establishment should allow for that mistake to be corrected.  He/she is absolutely in the right in taking them to the court.</p>

      <p>There&#039;s a bagel place in my hometown that I won&#039;t go to anymore because of a strange pricing scheme.  Obviously you expect that there&#039;s a price difference between a plain (uncut) bagel vs a bagel toasted with butter vs a bagel toasted with cream cheese.  But if you order a toasted bagel with cream cheese AND butter, they charge you an extra $0.50 for the butter!  I mean c&#039;mon, I&#039;m already paying you to cut and toast the bagel, along with the charge for cream cheese, but seriously, $0.50 to smear some butter on it before the cream cheese goes on?  I was shocked when I went with my family of four and paid an extra $2 just to add butter!  So I just don&#039;t go there anymore...</p>

      <p>This makes sense to me.  Most people don&#039;t get both butter and cream cheese so of course the price of the bagel with cream cheese is more than butter (since cream cheese is more expensive than butter) but does not include the butter.  So you have to pay more for both.  If you were at lunch and could order a chicken sandwich plain, with cheese for an extra charge, or with bacon for an extra charge, wouldn&#039;t it make sense that the extra charge would be more if you wanted both cheese and bacon?</p>

      <p>My point is that butter is usually a free condiment, at least in my part of the country &#8211; totally different from cheese or bacon.  I can understand charging more for the labor of cutting and toasting a bagel, but when you&#039;ve already paid for that labor as part of the &#034;with cream cheese&#034; option, you don&#039;t expect to be charged for that labor a second time.  It&#039;s just a very unusual practice from what I&#039;ve seen in my neck of the woods.</p>

      <p>I happen to own a restaurant.  I do not do most of these things, however somethings I do.  Most if not all of the things you mention effect the restaurant&#039;s bottom line... yes even giving extra ketchup.  The bottom line is I don&#039;t walk in to your office and say &#034;how dare you charge me X amount of dollars for your service&#034;  Either I want it or I don&#039;t.  My point is you don&#039;t know what goes into someone&#039;s bottom line.  If someone needs to charge a plate charge I&#039;m sure its not because they are trying to rip you off but there is an opportunity cost lost.  Each seat to is like real estate and you&#039;re not entitled to sit there unless you are spending money.  Butter &amp; bread costs money.  If it is not something that is offered (and believe me if its offered you&#039;re paying for it because it will be worked in to your entree&#039;s cost) you should be getting charged for it.  If there is a different charge for rocks and neat there is probably difference in the pour size.  Liquor is charged by the ounce.  Neat at one ounce is a shot, most people find this to be not enough, yet one ounce on the rocks looks very different.  One and a half ounces on a neat pour make most customer&#039;s satisfied hence the more money.  Im sure if you asked for a shot in a neat glass you&#039;ll be charged appropriately.  This article is insulting and misleading.  You are spouting off gripes without having done research and show a blatant disregard for someone elses bottom line.</p>

      <p>Then these extra charges should be clearly listed, on a board, OUTSIDE the joint so folks can decide if they want to pay it or not. Simple. Folks don&#039;t like it, they&#039;ll go someplace where they are treated like valued customers and not walking, talking ATM machines.</p>

      <p>And that is why I do not go to restaurants: it is all about the bottom line. Restaurants are taking advantage of America&#039;s lazy ways where it is easier to eat out than to cook at home. Automatically charging a gratuity so you can pay your employees less is a disgrace. I can understand fair and reasonable charges, but the industry is taking it to an extreme. </p>
<p>Here in New Zealand, the price you see on the menu is what you pay. Tax is included, all workers wages are included and there are no surprises. </p>
<p>Still, the solution is to cook at home: healthier, cheaper and less stressful than any restaurant.</p>

      <p>Just put it on the menu then, clearly listing the cost of all those extras. And don&#039;t BRING the bread without asking, then charge me when I didn&#039;t ask for it.

      <p>This is overly long MEB &#8211; sorry.  But MEB, this is about customer service and the impression it leaves.  Incorporate the costs into the menu prices so they are less noticeable.  Add-ons annoy people and cause them to not want to return (this article is only a reflection of that).  And BTW &#8211; I know what it takes to put a plate on a table.  Too many restaurant owners think they sell food &#8211; that their product is food.  It actually isn&#039;t.  You are selling, even at the diner level, an experience.  It might be a common experience or an extraordinary one.  Each of those have different value &#8211; each has it&#039;s place.  If you think you are selling food, well, you can&#039;t compete.  I can eat for less at home and in fact likely healthier.  Further, I bet a few of my dishes blow away anything your place has (a guess of course &#8211; but a safe one for me I think).  Yet, I may still go to your restaurant.  Why?  Because it is not simply about food.  It&#039;s about an experience.  A social experience, maybe (but not necessarily) a great culinary experience, an experience of convenience, (even) an experience of culture (like the M&amp;M Soul Cafe in Vegas as an example), or what have you.  If it is a positive experience I will return.  If it is not, I will not &#8211; and add-ons are a negative experience for me.  There is a restaurant across the street I never go to anymore.  4 out of 6 of a breakfast party I was with (not myself) got rather ill on the eggs one day (over easy only common item).  That is not why I do not go there.  I don&#039;t go there because I went back the next day and told them about the issue (politely) and instead of an apology for my bad experience I was informed they are not responsible if folks choose to eat undercooked eggs (which they gladly serve).  I wasn&#039;t asking for anything.  If they had said sorry and promised to look into it I would eat there now. But, I wouldn&#039;t eat filet minon there  now if it were free.  They sold me a bad experience.  Add-ons are also a bad experience.  You own a restaurant.  When you make the customer an enemy or adversary &#8211; you may as well hang it up.</p>

      <p>MEB, I agree with you. That everything costs and all that cost needs to be captured in sales.<br />
But restaurants need to clearly state the service and its associated fees. That way custoemrs do not feel like they&#039;re being taken for a ride.<br />
And as a business owner, you clealry described and defined the business aspect of your operation. However, you need to include marketing and building goodwill as part o fyour business strategy. No one will know or care that your entrees are $2-$3 dollars higher but customer will remember that you did not charge extra for bread, or for the second plate, or ....</p>

      <p>A restaurant once charged me $35 for cutting a cake that I brought for my Mothers 60th birthday. It was a small cake and we had spent a great deal of money there that night buying bottles of wine and sampling everything on the menu. They never told us about the fee when we asked them to cut the cake and at the end of the meal we asked them to take off the charge and they were so rude. I wrote a scathing review on yelp and I noticed they went out of business a few months later. I smile every single time I drive by the empty lot.</p>

      <p>My family been in the restaurant industry since the 80&#039;s and there was charges that we imposed on customers bill which had decent amount of feedback on it since.  I&#039;m currently running an Japanese Steakhouse where the chef comes and cook at the table.  We add an 18% service charge which is stated on every single page of the menu and on the receipt for a party of 6 or more.  Reason for us to do this is server usually get paid a very low hourly rate $2+ which ours being much higher than industry standard. The server make a living off tips and i would hate to see my hard working server getting cheated of a tip from a big party. It happened many times so we add it as a standard. Also teppanyaki chefs also makes a living off tips and they and the server shares the same tip equally.  This practice was frown upon by a local food critic which to me seem ridiculous.  Sure, there is special circumstances where the service is tremendously horrible which customer doesn&#039;t feel the need to tip.  Most the time when this does happen, customer would refuse to pay for the whole entire meal. From personal experience, those customers are the one that always try to cheat restaurant out of a free meal.  For me if i go somewhere where service is horrible, i will still tip because they make a living off it but i won&#039;t tip as much and won&#039;t come back again.  We also do a sharing up charge on the grill. We feel that is fair because the chef now have to cook for extra people and they get extra side of soup and salad for just $5 but some customers just feel like they are cheated.</p>

      <p>you are kinda contradicting yourself Jay. if there is a 18% automatic gratuity, then you don&#039;t have a decision on how much to tip, as you say you tip less for bad service...</p>

      <p>THe list is wide and absurd (I agree with the author). I&#039;ve been to places where they tried to pull this on me.  When the bill arrives I tell the waiter &#034;no&#034;. They can take it off the bill or I will take it off their tip.  If I go to a group meal and the waiter is atrocious &#8211; time to call the manager. He can either discount the meal or take off the 20%. There are ways to handle things. If the person tells me in ADVANCE then that is a different story &#8211; but I do not subscribe to surprise billing.  I have been to restaurants where I ordered food, then when I asked for something and they wanted to tack a stupid fee (the ketchup happened once) I told them I could either get the ketchup, or I leave (with the food on the table, and me not paying the bill). The ketchup arrived.<br />
Well run restaurants can make great profit &#8211; you don&#039;t have to rip off your customers.</p>

      <p>As a server i am 100% behind the 20% automatic tip for a group. Most groups never arrive on time and take longer to serve then say 5 or 6 tables of 4. This means the tables dont turn over and we dont make money. Also we are counting on the table to tip . Sometimes the bill is paid by one person and we can get stiffed very easily. I served a group one night of 16 one night and they asked for  the manager , The praised my service and said everything was fantastic. An older woman took the bill for the entire table and left no tip. Not only did they tie up a large portion of my section all night but i still had to tip out to the restaurant $12.00. So i lost money out of my own pocket to serve them. Put the 20% on all bills and if you are truly unhappy see the manager.</p>

      <p>I totally agree with you!  Large parties take much longer to serve and from my experience longer to even take their order.  I could serve 4 tables of 4 faster than 1 large party of 16.  Also, even if they aren&#039;t taking up your whole section, you may need to pass some tables off to other servers to properly serve such a large group. Now you have less tables and less tip opportunity.   I do believe that the surcharge for large parties should be clearly stated on the menu and customers should definitely be advised of any additional charges for special requests.   The only bad experience I&#039;ve had being charged a fee was at a Denny&#039;s. I was in my early 20&#039;s-20 yrs ago- at the time. I ordered coffee and while drinking it the cup slipped out of my hand and onto a small bread type plate. The plate broke. Our server came over, saw what happened and took the pieces away. we all made light of my slippery fingers lol and finished our meal.  When we got the check there was a $5 charge for the plate. I was shocked. $5 seemed extremely expensive for a plain white 6&#034; restaurant plate. I could have understood it if I had been being rowdy and horsing around and the plate broke but it simply slipped out of my fingers dues to the handle being wet.  I refused to pay it and was told I was &#034;banned&#034; from that Denny&#039;s.</p>

      <p>Large groups must be terrible to wait on. My softball team frequently goes out after games, and people are always leaving enough to cover the cost of their meal but little or nothing for the tip and disappearing before the bill arrives. We&#039;re all professionals and make decent money, so those left always throw in enough for a good tip ... but I could see where large groups that run up a $600 bill are too cheap throw in another $120 for the service after tying up three tables for hours. Without that mandatory 18%, the server would get stiffed more often than not.</p>
<p>Still, I&#039;ve seen 20% mandatory gratuities listed for groups as small as six. That is just ridiculous.</p>

      <p>Yeah, but that&#039;s not the RIGHT way of handling things. I hate you type of people who sees one thing wrong with the restaurant, then makes a huge fuss and demand discounts here and there, trying to screw people over. Also, don&#039;t take your anger out on the servers about certain things, most of the time they are not the ones who made the decision you&#039;re unhappy with.</p>

      <p>And it’s YOUR decision to eat there. It’s totally unrealistic to think that all employees agree with the rules and procedures set forth by their managers, regardless of where they work. Do you agree with all the rules you were forced to abide by, by your employer? Probably not. But sometimes, whether or not you agree with them, you have to just go with it, or you risk losing your job, which most of us can’t afford to do.  But the majority of the time, the servers have NO CONTROL over most of these issues, nor are they even aware that they exist half the time. If you truly have an issue with something, man up, and take it to an owner/manager, instead of taking it out on the server!</p>

      <p>justathought, facts remain, if I don&#039;t like my job, I can get another one as well. just as the waiter or waitress can find a different job if they don&#039;t like where they work, not my fault they don&#039;t like their job. charging me for something that is not listed as having a price on the menu, or charging extra for something the waiter or waitress did not tell me about is robbery. without something listed on the menu, for all I know, the restaraunt could charge me for ANYTHING they wish. I guess in the same sense though, when they try to do that to me, I could always say I charge &#034;x&#034; amount to dine here, then tell the manager/owner to stick it.</p>

      <p>I agree with furby, list everything on the menu that costs, if it&#039;s not there, it shouldn&#039;t be charged, and the waiter or waitress can take the issue up with the manager or owner. while the waiter or waitress may feel upset, they can deal with it on their own, not the customer fault the restaurant is trying to slip charges in.</p>

      <p>You are a jackass and are not welcome in any restaurant until you unlearn your sickeningly selfish behaviors. It is not your server&#039;s fault. He or she makes 2.13 an hour and doesn&#039;t make decisions regarding anything concerning pricing, menu items, etc. cook for yourself, you selfish prick.</p>

      <p>most of these just seem whiney, and being a chef i&#039;d like to weigh in about the sauce point.  Just for shits and giggles let&#039;s say the steak house is serving a demi glace.  That&#039;s a TWO DAY process starting with putting up a nice roasted veal stock overnight, then pulling, reducing, skimming, and fortifying the sauce.  So if you want more than what i&#039;ve costed this plate out for, then hell yes you are going to pay a little extra for it.</p>
<p>&#034;special&#034; butters as well.  dairy is expensive enough and making a nice compound butter to top your steak takes labor.  </p>
<p>Everything in a restaurant costs the restaurant money, if you want more than what has been costed out to be served you should expect to pay more.  If I have a consultation with a lawyer for an hour, and want to add extra time, should I expect that to be free?</p>

      <p>You meant Costco but thats okay. In recent events it seems the Darden chain has been buying lettuce from Walmart as their salads are absolutely bland and looked like they were just unpacked from the plastic pouch. Not going to Red Lobster or Olive Garden no mo....pays to learn to cook and take a stab at it as it saves you money and it is kinda fun to save money!</p>

      <p>But when you buy an entire strip to cut 10 steaks, at a cost of $4-5/lb., and charge $25 for 8oz, it seems like extra sauce would fit into that budget.  The margin on most restaurant plates is 60%, which means you should be able to compensate for extra demi glace.</p>

      <p>AND whats the alternative go out of business?  Better think these upcharges through. If they work for you more power to you but if you start to see in your books a start of a diminishing return better look REAL hard because it could be the beginning of the end. Many people are a lot more critical of what they eat and what it costs to consume same.<br />
In the end &#8211; restaurants are not a necessity.</p>

      <p>You said that you are a chef.  Doubtful that your restaurant will survive.  While I fully understand the effort and expense of food, supplies, overhead, labor and utilities, I price based upon an average consumer.  If a customer wants a little extra sauce, butter or mushrooms, I may lose a small amount of margin, but the goodwill and a repeat customer is worth more to me.  If the number of extra requests increases, then adjust the base price of the food.  Duhh.  It is no wonder that there is a continuing market for the Robert Irvine&#039;s of the world (Restaurant Impossible).</p>

      <p>But BK, if the demi glace sauce comes with the dish then you shouldn&#039;t expect to charge extra for it.  If someone asked you to leave it off would you discount the price?  Not likely.</p>

      <p>The reality is that nothing in a restaurant can be free &#8211; not even the bathrooms, because all of these things cost the owner real money. Americans have long been accustomed to &#034;bundled&#034; pricing, in airlines (&#034;free&#034; checked bags and meals) restaurants (&#034;free&#034; bread and coffee refills). In other parts of the world, unbundled pricing is more common. Bundled pricing typically leads to higher consumer prices since people use the &#034;free&#034; goods and services whether or not they would otherwise have purchased them.</p>

      <p>The only problem with that analysis is the unbundled price does not decrease the cost of the entree. The bundled price is the baseline and then the additional condiments/services are added to the charge.  It is a cost always added to, but never taken from.  The answer is, do not go to predatory restaurants.</p>

      <p>Charging for water is quite common in many of the countries that I&#039;ve visited. Also, one of the more ridiculous charges I&#039;ve found was a &#034;washing the dishes charge&#034; in Sicily. That charge was about $7 USD per person on top of the tips that were already added on. Never encountered that kind of charge again.</p>

      <p>Not really. I&#039;m well travelled and research locations before going, although I did not have time to choose a restaurant beforehand from local reviews for that particular visit since I was pressed for time. Asked locals afterwards and apparently that was the one restaurant that did it on the street. Oh well.</p>

      <p>Many restaurants here in Utah ask if they would like to get the same ordered drink at the table as also a drink to go (no charges) when you leave the restaurant.  Coming from California this almost floored me!</p>

      <p>Agree with all, except the New York bagel tax. This is not a special tax on &#034;altered&#034; bagels. This is the sales tax. As in many states, food purchased for preparation at home are not taxed; food prepared and served is taxed. Thus a bagel is not taxed, but if it&#039;s sliced and buttered and served, tax is charged.</p>

      <p>I live in NY and used to work at a grocery store as a cashier.  The sales tax and food stamp laws were mind-bogglingly confusing.  A cold meatball sandwich out of the deli case &#8211; no tax and food stamp-able, but a hot meatball sandwich made to order was a &#034;prepared&#034; item that triggered a sales tax and could not be purchased with food stamps.  Same with pizza &#8211; a cold one made in-store that you bake at home had no tax and was food stamp-able, but a hot pizza was a prepared food and charged sales tax and non-food stamp-able.  Wacky!</p>

      <p>I live in a touristy spot on the beach here in Sydney, and we often have &#034;weekend/holiday/any other day we choose per person cover charges&#034; added to our bills. It can be about $2.50-$5 per person. I&#039;m very shocked that hasn&#039;t happened in the big cities/tourist places in the US. I assume it&#039;s coming though... Of course, our waiters also make about $18/hour as minimum wage, so we hardly ever tip.</p>

      <p>&#034;Nothin&#039; sets off the flavor of a steak like some ketchup!&#034;</p>
<p>Completely agree on this point. This may have been designed to discourage people from requesting it. I like A-1 but I&#039;d never let it get close to a really nice fillet. </p>
<p>You&#039;ll find similar stories with other aspects. I think I remember a story a while back on a place that charged extra for well-done steak (effectively a pay us for ruining this for you charge) and some places will outright refuse it.</p>

      <p>Why would requesting steak sauce be a slap in the face of the chef? He/she prepared a good piece of meat but I prefer an additional layer of flavor. It is MY choice. I would challenge a surcharge for a small bowl of A1 or Heinz being added to my meal (they&#039;d never dare bring a bottle to the table where others could see it) and would never dine there again. My money ... my choice ... my food. Deal with it.</p>

      <p>The split plate makes sense to me. If you are sharing bites off each others plates it is just to try more variety of food. If you are getting one item, and splitting it two ways you&#039;re basically taking up two seats for the price of one. Restaurants don&#039;t make much money, they count on turn over to make what money they do. If every table is eating one dish split, they make half as much money.<br />
   I can also understand if you are charged for compound butters or sauces that are made. These cost extra money, and take more time to prepare. It is different than asking for a bottle of A-1 which you are probably going to use just a couple of cents worth.</p>

      <p>Went out to dinner at a high end restrant in Scottsdale AZ, Mastreo&#039;s Ocean Club. These guys just are unbelieveable. The place charges $4 for an 8oz soda and no free refills.  Mind you the average plate meal is $50-60, Side dish is $12-20, mixed drinks start @$10...It&#039;s a shame when High end places start charging for every little thing. It makes them look desperate for cash and that they take advantage of people out for special occasions. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they start to charge for the Bread but oddly this time they didn&#039;t.</p>

      <p>Should have went to Monti&#039;s La Casa Vieja on Mill Avenue.  We were on vacation and someone that my husband ran into while running up Camelback Mountain recommended it.  Food was excellent and staff was awesome.  Manager even gave us a tour and told us about the place.  The most amazing thing about the tour was that it was after they closed at 11 pm.  He didn&#039;t make us feel like we were in the way or anything.  Told us to take our time when my daughter was reading the captions on some of the pix.  Place dates from 1871..the building does.  Used to be an adobe hacienda.  Anyway..they there.  And try their Roquefort salad dressing.  No blue cheese for them.  Theirs is imported from France and there is a $2.00 upcharge but the server told us about it when I ordered it.  It was excellent and well worth the extra couple bucks.</p>

      <p>I was in Hong Kong on business around 20 years ago and went into a McDonald&#039;s,  After I got my food, I grabbed some ketchup packets and napkins from the counter and turned to walk away.  Complete pandemonium erupted.  The order taker literally started screaming.  Then her coworkers behind the counter joined in the yelling.  </p>
<p>Shocked, I froze and looked back at them in confusion.  They continued hollering hysterically at me in Cantonese, while gesturing angrily.   I had no clue what were they saying, and what to do.  So I just stared at them.  Finally, an English-speaking customer stepped forward and told me that condiments (including salt) and napkins are not free, and must be paid for.  I had no idea.  Embarrassed, the whole place staring at me, I quickly paid and left.  And I never went back.</p>

      <p>Tina, as I said, I was there on business, not for pleasure.  I ate plenty of local cuisine during that month long trip.  But on that day, I was busy running around the city, from meeting to meeting.   Sometimes you just need something fast and quick, no matter what country you&#039;re in.  McD&#039;s is nowhere near my first choice, but when time is short...</p>

      <p>I wish I could bill a restaurant for all the problems from start to finish.  From lousy service to an intentionally erroneous bill (everything charged ala carte when they should know their menu) to a mandatory 18% tip for a party of 5!  Everything that went wrong, could go wrong at a well-established restaurant managed by veterans in the business.  If only a critic could have shared my experience!</p>

      <p>JUST FYI-Mc Donalds, and most fast food restaurants in the rest of the world charge for condiments  (nearly all of Europe, India, SE Asia, Japan, South Africa). It seems like only in the America&#039;s do they not.  I haven&#039;t been charged for ketchup in Mexico or Canada.  Peculiar?</p>

      <p>I lived in Japan for a year  &amp; went to McDonald&#039;s probably once a month when I was missing &#034;Western&#034; food. I was never asked to pay extra for ketchup. They would just ask me how many packets I wanted. The thing I like about American restaurants vs Europe/Asia is the free refills on drinks. Yes I know it&#039;s bundled into the meal price but I tend to drink a lot when I eat regardless of what I am drinking (water, tea, pop, etc). When all you&#039;re given is one small 8 oz glass and charged $3+ for it, you don&#039;t want to pay for another glass &amp; often they don&#039;t offer water.</p>

      <p>Some places will charge you a fee or flat out refuse to let you eat carryout in their restaurant.  Never happened to me, but I know of one story of somebody picking up a pizza to go, a thunderstorm comes pouring down so they sit down to eat and they are told they are not allowed to.  Some lame argument about servers not getting tips this way.  Sounds like bad business to me, especially when you never intended to sit down and eat, but circumstances kind of force your hand.</p>

      <p>It probably depends on what kind of place it is&#8211;if it&#039;s a pizza place where you basically get your slices at the counter and then can either sit or go, then it is wrong to charge for sitting. BUT, if it is a full-on sit-down restaurant with servers and hostesses that does carryout, then I can see why they wouldn&#039;t want a carryout patron to just sit at a table with their order&#8211;especially if there are sit-down patrons waiting to be seated.</p>

      <p>Mr. Cury,  WHY is it fair to charge an automatic 20% tip onto a larger group?  This group is going to eat a lot more than just a couple, for example.  So if you have 15% or 18%, whatever, and you increase that by the amount of food eaten with a group of, say, six people instead of that couple, man, you&#039;re getting a much bigger tip.  Why ad insult to injury by not just getting more money (because of much larger bill) but a higher percent of that, too?  And yes, I was in the restaurant business for many years.</p>

      <p>There&#039;s always still a line on the bill for &#034;tip.&#034;  If the service is not commensurate with &#034;mandatory&#034; tip, then just write a negative number on that line and subtract off the undeserved portion of the tip.  I dare the restaurant manager to argue with you much about it.</p>

      <p>Wow I never actually thought of that, interesting concept.   I guess if it is displayed on the menu then you should be charge the fee, although it should be the standard 15% giving you the option to add more if you thought it was great service.</p>

      <p>What most people do not realize is that the 20% gratuity is added to the total after taxes.  So after taxes, it becomes  more than 20% since in some states, tax can be as high as 10%.</p>

      <p>Then you are paying tax on the tip!  Either way these two items (tip and tax) must be calculated separately which is almost never the case.  I see almost everyone add tip % on top of the (total+tax) which means they are tipping more than they think they are.  To be accurate it should be only % on total.</p>

      <p>Jim, obviously you have NEVER waited on large groups.  I work in a resort community in the Florida panhandle.  Where we are located, on scenic 30-A on the Emerald Coast, we have parties of 10 to 30+ all summer long.  If you dont think that a party of 6 adults and 24 kids want drop you tip, you are wrong.  Kids menu items are typically cheaper.  They share.  Parents order them a soda or only water.  This drops a check drastically.<br />
Now, this table requires all of your time to get that many orders properly, refill drinks and keep up with the table.  You now loose the option of turning your table.  Believe me......20% is not enough.  Try it sometime.  Oh, and BTW.....I choose this line of work because i like it.</p>

      <p>agree completely and as someone that has been going to the Emerald Coast for 15 years and staying on 30A exclusively for the past 5 I know what you are talking about.   Best of luck and hopefully you keep the policies in place to ensure you are taken care of for serving these larger parties.</p>

      <p>Even worse is a growing number of places that set it up so the mandatory tips do not go to the servers at all, but to the company as if it was an item from the menu, and the servers only get any additional tip that is added on top of that in the optional section.  Many states don&#039;t allow this, but if you think the service is bad when they know they&#039;re going to get 20% for sure, imagine how bad the service is when they know the 20% doesn&#039;t go to them and the party won&#039;t tip them because they&#039;ve already been charged once.  I&#039;ve done the negative tip thing to take off the 20% then put cash on the table at places that do that and haven&#039;t been charged on my cc yet for the mandatory tip, but i&#039;m not sure if the server actually got to keep the cash.</p>

      <p>I worked in a 5 star hotel for many years and the stuff they charge is ridiculous like $8 for soda but when it comes down to it. The cost it takes to operate and keep a hotel that nice, clean, updated, trained talents gets very expensive. People pay for the environment.  Also about that 20% service charge, I worked on a rooftop bar for few years and if you ever been a server trying to take care of a group of 30 in 110 degree weather in a full suit while they are all getting intoxicated for 4 hours? and worst of it is the management tells you not to charge service charge on those group because they are VIP and looks bad and they left without leaving a dime because they are so intoxicated to know.  </p>
<p>There is good side and bad side to the service charge but in this industry i believe that its imposed because of those not tipping customers. </p>
<p>I went to Korea and they don&#039;t take tip but add a mandatory 10-15% service charge on every bill. I know a lot of restaurant in the city are doing the same thing</p>

      <p>This has been debated to death.</p>
<p>Large groups ALWAYS take up a whole lot more time.</p>
<p>Large groups NEVER have everyone show up on time.</p>
<p>Large groups make it very easy for people not to leave tips, everyone &#034;assumes&#034; someone else is going to tip.</p>
<p>Large groups always complain the most, they don&#039;t understand why you can&#039;t serve 20 people all exactly at the same time.</p>

      <p>Because your group is going to be a lot more work than the table of one or two, which the waiter -still- has to wait on in addition to your party of 6-10 (Personally I think the magic number is 8+, automatic gratuity). And what if the party doesn&#039;t leave anything? Or tips very poorly (it happens all the time, whether its due to the fact that they assume there&#039;s a gratuity already, or more likely they are cheap)? Not to mention that a good deal of restaurants force waiters to share parties and the tip coming from that party (So instead of getting 20 from the party you&#039;re down to 10, less if it is a bigger party and more waiters are required).</p>

      <p>Because big groups run up a $1000 bill, and then decide that $200 is way too much to tip a lowly server, and think that they are being generous throwing $40 on the table. The server ends up with a 4% tip that is probably getting split with kitchen and bussing staff.</p>

      <p>I don&#039;t mind the &#034;extra plate&#034; charge when it is 1/4 or less than the price of the lowest cost menu item and allows two diners to dine on one meal.  Often restaurants offer generous portions because many people demand them (feel cheated with less food and would not go to the restaurant if the portions were smaller), but when 2 customers who are happy with smaller meals and eating the same thing as each other are served, it is reasonable to expect more income for the restaurant than if only one customer were served.   It still means a much cheaper meal for the customers than ordering 2 meals, and does not create the waste (or waist) issues.</p>

      <p>Often when restaurants split a meal back in the kitchen, they garnish both plates and serve more than half of the one-meal-sized side dish (veggie or slaw or fries, etc.).  I think the fee makes sense in that case.</p>

      <p>The first time I encountered an extra plate charge was several years ago.  This place served enormous salads...HUGE....so a friend and I went there and ordered one but asked for an extra plate.  They said it would be added charge of 1/2 price.  We only got one....and each had our own fork and ate out of the same plate.....never returned......never will.  This encourages gluttony and the biggest glutton is the restaurant.</p>

      <p>BALONEY!   The restaurant makes no more money on a single person sitting at a table with one meal as it makes on two people sitting at the same table with the same one meal!  It is NOT the number of occupied CHAIRS that matters, it is the number of available TABLES!  DUH!   As long as you are not occupying more than one table, it costs the restaurant absolutely NOTHING more to allow two people to share one meal!  This is nothing more than pure GREED!</p>

      <p>Saying a restaurant is greedy is like saying any business is greedy. They just want paying customers, and yes the ideal situation would be no empty seats. The only other way to combat people ordering like this is to decrease portion sizes. Then you complain about that. So just don&#039;t be so cheap, buy a meal for each person. You guys are the same people that take ketchup packets for home use. Who goes by themselves to dinner anyways?</p>

      <p>Again, I see a difference between having that salad split between two plates in the kitchen (in which case you have ordered two half-orders, and should be charged extra), and the server bringing you an extra plate (which should not incur a charge).  I would not have tipped a server who saw me sharing a plate and didn&#039;t offer to bring an extra, small plate.</p>

      <p>I rarely eat at buffets, and when I do I take only what I can eat. But often you taste something and it&#039;s awful, or just not worth eating when there are so many good things on offer (or you notice only when you&#039;ve gotten a good look at it that there&#039;s an ingredient you can&#039;t eat).  If anyone tried to charge me for the small bits of food I&#039;d rejected, I would refuse to pay.  You can&#039;t force someone to eat, and you&#039;d be treading on dangerous ground to require that diners clean their plates.  I&#039;d love to take a case like that to court.</p>
<p>I will not eat at a restaurant that demands a credit card for a reservation, unless it&#039;s a &#034;special&#034; dining night, like Valentine&#039;s Day, etc.  And as for increased prices for peak times, I think the way to go is reduced prices for off-peak times, no?</p>
<p>I get angry when the extra charges are hidden.  At one long-established local restaurant, a server comes to your table while you are looking at menus, and offers an assortment of munchies in small bowls, presented on a tray.  You are told to select what you want.  Only when you get the bill do you learn that you are charged per bowl.  Sure, patrons won&#039;t get tricked twice, but the place gets a lot on one-time tourist traffic.</p>

      <p>I have kids, but I think some restaurants shouldn&#039;t allow kids. Some types of restaurants are place we go to escape our kids and get away. When paying $100 a person, it&#039;s nice to have grown up time.</p>

      <p>If I walk into a restaurant and see kids I exit immediately. Don&#039;t want them around at anytime but certainly not at mealtime. I served my time with four and don&#039;t need some other family&#039;s brats to ruin my meal.</p>

<p>There are some restaurants in our area that ban children. The people I know who have children won&#039;t patronize the place on their &#034;date nights&#034; out without their kids, on principle.</p>

      <p>Most agreed with you. I expect little rug rat behavior at McDonalds, Wendys and Chucky Cheeses, but if I&#039;m going to a nice, upscale, sit down restaurant, then I want to be able to enjoy the meal WITHOUT brats ruining the meal.</p>

      <p>I find it funny that getting a burger with mayo costs a lot extra at a fast food place (they charge you for the &#034;deluxe&#034; version), but asking for a side is free.</p>
<p>And Ive never had a split charge, if I ever get one you can be 100% sure the tip lines are going to be crossed out.</p>

      <p>A good server will just bring you an extra plate and not bill you for it.  A good server will say &#034;we usually charge for this but I&#039;m not going to charge you&#034; and thus that server has a better chance to get a GREAT tip.</p>

      <p>If the server wasnt brain dead lazy there wouldnt be a split charge, that is a complete result of servers complaining about it. They dont deserve a tip if theres a split charge to make up for their laziness.</p>

      <p>The bagel &#034;fee&#034; is a tax leveled on prepared foods in certain jurisdictions where grocery items are generally exempt from sales taxes. Most prepared foods are also ineligible for purchase with food stamps. I will walk out of any restaurant that notes any of those other fees on it&#039;s menu including the 20% or any other % automatic tip. If not on the menu but appears on my bill I will not pay it.</p>

      <p>The opposite is true with McDonalds &#8211; every so often when I am traveling with my dog, I will go to McDonald&#039;s and order a McDouble cheeseburger (no toppings, just meat, bread and cheese) for me and a McDouble hamburger (again no toppings) for my dog and I still pay the same for both.   Also &#8211; if they are selling large drinks for $1 and coffee costs $1,29 at breakfast, if I get a value meal and replace the coffee with another drink, why do they charge me an additional 35 cents, I am downgrading according to your menu.</p>

I don&#039;t get any of thr toppings, except cheese, either because it just doesn&#039;t taste too good.  I still get charged full price for a burger.

      <p>I ordered happy meal for my son and I don&#039;t allow him to drink soda.  So I asked if I could have a water.  They said they cannot give tap water in a happy meal or replace it with bottled.  So I reluctantly ordered an orange juice.  They said they only had Hi-C available.  So I decided, no drink.  That&#039;s when the most outrageous part came.  If you order a happy meal without a soda, they will charge you for your burger, fries, and apple slices a la carte, it will not include a toy and it will be more expensive than if you ordered a soda.  Shocked, I ordered a sprite and when they gave it to me, I dropped it and left.  McDonald&#039;s is refusing to not give you a soda when you order food for children, how is that for their &#034;healthier&#034; image?</p>

      <p>I had the same thing happen at Burger King at breakfast. Wanted a breakfast sandwich, but no drink. Charge was higher, and they would not budge (even though it saves them the cost of a drink, however marginal). I just walked out.</p>

      <p>Same thing with breakfast sandwiches at McD&#039;s. I&#039;d rather just have an egg and cheese sandwich - no greasy meat.  You can get a Sausage and Cheese McMuffin for $0.99, but if you as for an egg and cheese they charge you full price ($2.99) as if you ordered it with a meat.  Makes no sense.</p>

      <p>I recently went to a local coffee house/bakery for a morning coffee and croissant.  It wasn&#039;t my usual spot, and I wanted to try it.  After I sat down, I went looking for the napkins, knives, and (most importantly) the butter.  When I couldn&#039;t find it, I asked the cashier; she informed me the butter was extra.  $.50 extra!  I was peeved to say the least.  Why didn&#039;t she ask me when I was ordering and paying?!  Seriously, butter is extra?  I won&#039;t go back there.  The croissant was average.  The place close by has much better pastries and has all the butter I want.  Jam too!</p>

      <p>I&#039;d have to agree.  There are certain foods that almost require toppings to the customer&#039;s preference.  It&#039;s like ordering a steak and having an up charge if you would like it seasoned, or ordering fries and an up charge for ketchup.  I&#039;d probably tell the manager that I&#039;m never coming back and make sure that a few other customers hear me.  I hate being nickel and dimed for little things like that.</p>

      <p>It&#039;s is one of my biggest pet peeves. When my husband stops off at Taco Bell he picks me up  a 7 layer burrito. I&#039;m all excited at the treat till I open the bag and see no sauce. I can&#039;t complain to him because he just did it to be nice, but they never ask if you want sauce packets. He never remembers to ask and if they don&#039;t remind him, I have to go without. How hard is it to say? &#034;sauce packets?&#034; I&#039;ve worked in fast food, it&#039;s simple enough. I&#039;ve called to complain, they&#039;ve promised to train their employees but guess what, last week, no sauce.</p>

      <p>I usually avoid restaurants that charge most of these extra fees. But the one thing that drives me crazy is the automatic gratuity for a party of 6 or more. First, it assumes that even if the server gives excellent service, that the customer will shortchange the tip (or, it assumes that we can&#039;t do math on a large check, which is also insulting). Second, I have been in restaurants with large parties many times, and most of the time, the service actually does suck (probably because the server knows they are guaranteed a tip no matter what). </p>
<p>A tip is for good service&#8211;not an automatic expectation. That means the customer gets to decide what to give, not the restaurant.</p>

      <p>It can be a slap in the face, but large parties typically do take up a disproportional amount of time, on the server&#039;s part, than the same amount of people at multiple tables, especially distributing and collecting multiple payments.  Larger groups also tend to stick around longer consuming only free refills and not necessarily spending any more money.</p>
<p>If the service is bad, you talk to a manager.  Don&#039;t sweat the extra gratuity because if you really had unpleasant service, a manager will typically more than make up for it with a discount or gift card.</p>

      <p>If the service is bad, just go to that line on the check where it says &#034;tip,&#034; write in a negative number, and subtract the undeserved portion of the tip right off of the bill.  If the waiter or manager wants to discuss it, they&#039;ll have to account for the poor service.  Your bank will pay the amount you wrote in as the total.</p>

      <p>Six couples at six tables = six checks. Six couples at three tables shoved together = 6 checks. Also, filling water glasses and such for one large group instead of six smaller ones takes less trips.  I do not see your point.</p>
<p>I go out in large groups frequently. We often have groups of 12 to 20. We order a lot of food, and we tip well. Some establishments are very welcoming. Others act like we are a huge inconvenience. They lose our future business.</p>
<p>We&#039;re usually out after early or mid-week sports, later in the evening, well past the dinner rush. You&#039;d think a 3/4 empty place would be glad to get an extra $1000 to $2000 in walk-in business, but some places / servers act like a big group and separate checks is just too much bother.  Guess what, server? It might be a chore to ring up 10 checks near closing time, but those empty tables weren&#039;t going to tip you $200-$400.</p>

      <p>The only reason places do that is because of the amount of people who stiff servers. Having tables with large parties requires more time and work than smaller parties. From personal experience, and from friend&#039;s experiences, it is ridiculous to have a party of 10, work your butt off and then be lucky to receive a 10% gratuity. People think the servers are receiving a wage, so why do they need to tip? They don&#039;t realize most servers do not even make minimum wage. I made $4 an hour when I was a server. Servers live off of tips!</p>
<p>I&#039;m not a huge fan of automatically adding 20% gratuity, but it makes sense for larger parties, and I don&#039;t see a problem with it as long as the customers are informed of the policy before hand.</p>

      <p>But those people probably stiff the servers regardless, right? I get what you&#039;re saying, but 10% of a bill for a large party is still more than the 10% the same person would tip if it was just 2 people. A person who tips 20% normally isn&#039;t  suddenly going to be cheap just because the party is large. </p>
<p>I don&#039;t know, it just feels wrong.</p>

      <p>But.....if you have four tables of two, instead of one group of eight or more, I can almost guarantee the tip is better.  Parties arent concerned with the server....just that their large party is taken care of implicitly with no concern of the amount of time they are consuming.  Communal groups who insist on having dinner in a restaurant together......with split checks and no gratuity added, should have to wait on their own group.   Again....i challenge you to work in the industry and think otherwise.</p>

      <p>every server is assigned a section and let say your section only had 3 table of 4 tops. A group of 12 comes in and takes all three tables. The whole 2-3 hours you wait on that big party is the only tip you will make on those hours so i feel sometimes 20% service charge isn&#039;t even enough. Larger party also have slower turn around time verses group of 2 or 3</p>

      <p>I understand where you are coming from. As a waiter I have witnessed and even split large parties with other waiters/waitresses who have given poor service simply because they know that the check will have an auto gratuity. Having said that I have waited tirelessly on large and small parties only to find a tip 10% or below, or no tip at all. Servers make $2.13 an hour, and rather than risk spending an hour or two waiting on a large group of people only to make $6 or $7, I choose to be sure that I am at least going to be payed what I deserve for my work. Perhaps if there were a universal etiquette on how to tip and treat your waiter, we wouldn&#039;t need to add on any gratuities.</p>

      <p>There is now federal minimum wage laws. If you are getting 2.13 per hour, your employer MUST ensure you are taking home  $7.25. Not great, but I am sick of servers throwing that $2.13 out there. It is only in some states that allow $2.13 and as I say, federal law mandates you take home at least $7.25.</p>

      <p>Not true for tipped employees.  The minimum wage is only 2.13 for certain employees who primarily earn their money from tips.</p>
<p>I never mind the mandatory tip for large parties.  I&#039;m always going to drop ~20% on the tip anyway, and I recognize that a single large party (especially during the lunch shift) seriously impairs the server&#039;s ability to deal with other tables.  In addition, large parties tend to stay at the meal longer than a group of 2-4, meaning that in the time it takes to serve a single group of 8, the server could have served 3 or 4 groups of 4.</p>
<p>It&#039;s reasonable to guarantee a certain minimum tip in this case, so that the server is guaranteed to make money off the deal.  (Otherwise no servers would be motivated to work large parties.)</p>
<p>Just make sure it&#039;s noted as such on the bill and I don&#039;t have a problem.</p>

      <p>Not at ALL true for servers and some other tip-based employees. I made about $5/hour when I was serving a couple of years ago and that was considered &#034;good&#034; base pay.</p>

      <p>Stop being a cheapskate. If you don&#039;t want to pay for the service, then you can go to the grocery store. By the grocery , wash it, prep it, cook it and serve it yourself. You don&#039;t have to tip yourself. Don&#039;t forget to wash the dishes. You can then complain about your own bad service. You don&#039;t have to tip yourself.</p>

      <p>John and spoonfedkitty,</p>
<p>scooterdie is correct.  For tipped employees whose tips fail to increase their income from $2.13/hr. to $7.25/hr., employers must make up the difference.</p>

      <p>The &#034;to insure proper/prompt service&#034; thing is something made up by cheapskates.  Tips is not an acronym. The historically accurate &#034;tip&#034; was the tip of the spear that would be shoved through your a** at the village meadhall if you didn&#039;t pay the barmaids.  It evolved a little afterwards in that you&#039;d pay more up front for your drinks to the server bringing your ales so they&#039;d pay you more attention instead of the peasants at the next table.  The practice today is why good tipping regulars get the attention and a fresh refill while you stare blankly at the wall in front of an emtpy glass wondering what&#039;s going on.</p>

      <p>What you fail to take in to consideration is that servers in many parts of this country work on tips alone. When server&#039;s wages are under $3/hr, we sometimes end up OWING money on payday to cover the taxes on our presumed tips (based on the servers&#039; sales). So while you may feel gratuity should be optional, when someone stiffs a server, that server may actually end up not only waiting on that table for free, but because they are taxed on a percentage of their sales, they actually end up paying to serve that table.</p>
<p>That being said; if there is a large party or banquet assigned to a particular server, that means that they will be taking substantially fewer or no other tables for that evening. So that ONE party determines a large percent or ALL of their earnings for the evening. You seem offended at not being trusted to tip appropriately but the unfortunate fact of the matter is that there are a lot of people out there who just don&#039;t. I&#039;ve had people compliment me up and down for a fantastic evening and fantastic service and even ask to speak with the manager to let him know how wonderful I was and then leave me a 5% tip. If I get stiffed on a small table it&#039;s unfortunate but I can try to make it up on the next one. But if I spend ALL or MOST of my night on one large party and it just so happens that they are cheap-skates or ill-informed on tipping protocol, that could end up being several hundred dollars out of my pocket and that&#039;s not a risk I should have to take.</p>
<p>When I know there is an auto-grat attached to a party, I go above and beyond to ensure that they are getting a level of service that will be deserving of that. And if you go somewhere with a large party where the service is truly deplorable than by all means say something. But otherwise try to understand that the gratuity is not simply an extra little bonus for your server...it is their livelihood. And while you may feel you always tip appropriately, rest assured there are people out there who don&#039;t.</p>

      <p>Never been to a restaurant that put a mandatory tip on a table of 6, table of 8 or more yes, but not on 6. But if you object, you could go in as 2 groups of 3 and get two tables and avoid the automatic tip. You could also probably get the meals to go and sit where ever in your own home.</p>

      <p>The one I see doing this the most is McDonald&#039;s.  I wanted mayo instead of ketchup on my sandwich and they charged me $.30 (this is in the Indianapolis market).  It&#039;s not a big deal.....but kind of flabbergasted me since they give away PACKAGES of mayo for free.  So, lesson learned: don&#039;t have McDonald&#039;s put the mayo on your sandwich in Indianapolis.  Ask for the free packet and do it yourself :-).</p>

      <p>rhobere is correct that European restaurants usually charge for water - but they don&#039;t gouge for bottled water like in the US.  It&#039;s also the case that in many Euro countries they charge for bread, so you have be careful to decline it if you don&#039;t want it. So extras happen there as well as in the US - you just have to know about them.</p>

      <p>In some European countries, like Italy for example, it doesn&#039;t matter if you turn down the bread, because you will still be charged the &#034;coperto&#034; or cover charge. This is essentially the &#034;tax&#034; or tip to even dine out. And if you do tip, they&#039;ll look at you like you have 7 heads, because it was already included in the bill. :)</p>

      <p>In some European countries, the waiter will immediately bring a basket of rolls. They are NOT free, you are billed for the number you take. This is not a scam, as the customers already know this is the normal way of doing business. The rolls you don&#039;t take are simply offered to the next table. Americans might consider this unsanitary, but it&#039;s no different than being handed a roll by your wife, nobody gets sick from it.</p>

      <p>I don&#039;t eat out unless I absolutely must. Why anyone would pay more than quadruple the price of food in order to willingly subject themselves to unhealthy ingredients, unhygienic conditions, grouchy, fake and pretentious fake servers, noisy and crowded environment, greedy management is beyond me. Even when traveling, with a quick visit to a local grocery store, you can get much healthier no-preparation food at a fraction of the price.</p>

      <p>Maybe because there are some things that cost a heck of a lot more to make at home than eating out.  Lasagna for instance, which costs me upwards of $50 to make a pan, silly for a single person.  I can get a lasagna dinner at my local pizza place (not a franchise place) with garlic bread and salad for $10, eat a third, take 2/3 home for an additional 2 meals, so that $10 meal (plus tip) ends up costing me $4 each for three meals.</p>

      <p>Don&#039;t you just love the fuzzy math people come up with to get out of cooking?  </p>
<p>A pan of lasagna:  Noodles, $2.  Ricotta, $3.  Mozzarella, $4.  Pound of sausage, $4. Two jars of sauce, $5.  That&#039;s only $18 for the basic ingredients.  You may throw in a few extras, but they&#039;d have to be damn expensive to get up to $50.</p>

      <p>May not quite cost $50 to make a pan of lasagna, but it can be expensive. The noodles may be cheap, but when you add in the meat (sausage or ground beef), the cheese, the sauce, chopped onions, mushrooms and other fixings, it can get expensive. Then of course the cost of utilities for cooking the meal and clean up.</p>

      <p>Corkage fee?  If they were charging even as much sa 50% over retail for wine, I would happily pay it.  But to charge 2-300% over retail, as is common in the USA, l and then charge more that 10% of the retail price if I bring my own wine is robbery.  It&#039;s also bad business.  I would buy much more wine at restaurants if the price were reasonable.</p>

      <p>You can&#039;t tell us you don&#039;t agree with charging for butter and sauce, then say it&#039;s perfectly reasonable to charge $3 for bread and $2 for the butter that goes with it.  I suppose it&#039;s reasonable <i>if you make it clear beforehand that there&#039;s a fee</i> to charge for bread, but a separate fee for the butter?  Why? </p>
<p>I don&#039;t mind an automatic gratuity (of 15-18%, not 20) for large groups, as long as it&#039;s clear they will be charging it before the meal, and it&#039;s clearly stated on the receipt.  But that&#039;s all they get when they charge it.  I won&#039;t tip extra.  And I don&#039;t like being deceived.  If they try to charge me and don&#039;t tell me, I will have a problem, and then they will have a problem.  </p>
<p>I&#039;m also not going to pay for prime time or atmosphere.  It&#039;s pretentious and unnecessary, and I&#039;m rather tired of being nickled and dimed absolutely everywhere for everything.</p>

      <p>Understandable.  But the author can&#039;t have it both ways. Either he&#039;s for charging for every little condiment, or against it.  </p>
<p>Really, if you&#039;re going to charge for the bread, why not just roll in the price for butter or oil so that your customer won&#039;t feel cheated?</p>

      <p>The condiment conflict is kind of amusing.</p>
<p>I&#039;ve always been pretty forgiving of the automatic gratuity. Then again I guess I&#039;m pretty forgiving regardless, I can only think of a couple times in my life where I deliberately left a poor tip. I usually tip 20% as my minimum and frequently hit around 30% especially at lunch because I always tip at least $3.</p>
<p>I don&#039;t know that I would pay for eating at prime times or at specific tables, but I wouldn&#039;t rule it out. To me it&#039;s about getting what you want, if you are willing to pay a little extra for it then so be it. If a restaurant is always packed with a 45 minute wait during specific times of the day then charging a little more during those times makes good business sense for everyone involved. If done right the business still serves as many customers as they can over a given time while making a little more profit, and if it results in less of a wait time then the customer also benefits by being served more promptly.</p>

      <p>Very well written article. I have been a chef, with an involvement in the food industry for my whole life and completely agree with most of what you say. The hidden costings in setting up and running a catering business/ restaurant, not to mention the rise in the cost of ingredients and transportation have forced the industry to squeeze pennies out of every place possible &#8211; sad truth. However, I am souly referring to the characteristics of a small/ private business within this economical climate. The slightly more corporate side of this argument is an absolute joke, for example McDonalds charging extra for ketchup &#8211; do they really not make enough money already? £6-£7 for a large burger, chips and a drink that would cost no more that 80p for a corporation of that size to put together. It&#039;s a real shocker that they can even get away with it &#8211; what&#039;s to come in the future? A breathing fee?</p>

      <p>When pouring a drink &#039;neat&#039; or even a martini &#039;straight up&#039; more alcohol IS used (1 1/2 oz vs 1 1/4 oz), therefore you SHOULD charge more.</p>

      <p>It isn&#039;t a matter of what you want. Bartenders (I have been one) have a certain protocol in making drinks. They won&#039;t ask you if you want 1/4 oz more liquor in your drink, it is made a certain way and unless you specify otherwise, that is how it will be poured. I have had a few people get pissed off at me because I filled the glass completely with ice. Sorry, that is protocol in any bar, fill the glass to the top with ice first, then build the drink. If you don&#039;t like a lot of ice then you should state that when you place your order. If you think you will end up with more booze then you are stupid, you will end up with more mix instead. So in your case whether you like it or not, or whether you know it or not, you are getting slightly more booze if ordered neat or in the case of a martini, straight up. And you should be getting charged slightly more because of that. If you want a double, that is your prerogative but unless you specify, you have no control over how your drink is poured. And if anyone is still listening: If you ask a bartender to make you a &#039;good&#039; drink or suggest he/she make it stronger than a standard pour, you should be asked if you want a double. If you say &#034;no, just give me a hefty pour&#034;, well, we know someone looking to get something for nothing is most likely a poor tipper and you will be getting a standard, or less than standard pour. Fact of life.</p>

      <p>If I orders 3 fingers of scotch &#8211; on the rocks or neat &#8211; it should still be the same.  If you can&#039;t figure out how much the ice displaces the scotch you should pour the scotch then put the ice in.  There is no reason why the amount of alcohol should vary that much between neat/on the rocks that would warrant an up-charge.</p>

      <p>Actually Josh, you pour a significant amount more when a drink is ordered with rocks.  The 1 or 2 dollar upcharge is completely reasonable.  I frequently get complaints from guests if their cocktail ordered on the rocks does not seem to fill the glass, which will normally necessitate giving them an additional full ounce.  And you don&#039;t order drinks by the finger and dictate your own price.  A house&#039;s pour is their pour.  If I do a four count on a neat pour and it&#039;s a $12 glass of JW black, but I need to do a 6 count to fill a rocks glass, the drink should technically cost $18.  You&#039;re getting a deal with a $2 upcharge.</p>

      <p>I don&#039;t get it. Use a shot glass if you can&#039;t pour the same amount each time. Either way, it should be 1.5 oz. Yes, it will look like less in different glasses with ice or not &#8211; but it doesn&#039;t matter.<br />
Technically, some states have limitations/regulations on this. (Not that you are going to have a perfect pour every time).<br />
It&#039;s too complicated to explain price differences with ice or without.</p>

      <p>have you ever tried splitting a check? split a pitcher of beer, bottle of wine, app, dessert especially when everyone didn&#039;t share it? Then you have 8 separate credit cards or cash payments needing change? Believe me your other tables do not appreciate waiting for your attention while you are spening all of your time with this one table.</p>

      <p>If you&#039;re a waiter or waitress, ask at the beginning of the meal if it&#039;s all on one check, then just keep track of who has what.  You&#039;re writing it down anyway.  Then there&#039;s not a lot of extra time. </p>
<p>I&#039;m sorry that splitting a check takes two extra minutes.  Still no excuse to charge for it or refuse to do it. Unless you&#039;ve been going incredibly slow all night, most of your patrons won&#039;t even notice a delay.</p>

      <p>Actually, not at all.  I don&#039;t mess with the folks handling my food, and generally when I&#039;m eating out, I&#039;m concentrating on having a good experience.</p>
<p>But splitting a check is a simple task.  I understand if it&#039;s not the favorite part of your job, but you know what, I do things every day that I dislike or even hate because it&#039;s part of my job.  I don&#039;t refuse to do it.  I don&#039;t charge extra for it.  And I don&#039;t make snotty comments online about how no one should expect it.</p>

      <p>It has also been my experience (as a former waiter) that you make more money in tips when the check is split anyway.  Maybe only a buck or two, but if you aren&#039;t capable of handling this process swiftly then you shouldn&#039;t be a server....bus tables instead (it&#039;s not so taxing on your mental abilities.</p>

      <p>I agree Josh, when I used to be a waitress I found the tip was better when the check was split. Primarily because some people prefer to tip high whereas as a group they may have just done a standard percentage.  And as wah wah wah said .. if you know ahead of time (the server can just as easily ask if the checks are being split) then you can separate accordingly as you take the orders.</p>

      <p>Actually you have no idea what you&#039;re preaching about.  At peak hours, I may have as many as 8 tables ordering up to 32 individual drinks, apps, and entrees within a 30 minute period as long as the front of house has any experience with pacing how I&#039;m being sat.  It&#039;s quite possible if not probable that I&#039;ve thrown away any paperwork with your order on it, and if the restaurant isn&#039;t using pivot points which their POS can make easily accessible to the server, we will definitively NOT be spending two minutes of our time splitting your check.  It&#039;s absolutely lovely when 7 people are splitting 4 apps, two women are sharing a salad (one came with her daughter who had one bite, and one came with a man...are they splitting the cost of the salad?  Who&#039;s bill does it go on? Is the man paying for the lady? Are they on the same tab or are they just friends going dutch?  Now, let&#039;s stand at your table while we literally have 4 dozen OTHER tasks that need to be accomplished concurrently for other tables and watch you all look at each other and say, &#034;Well, I guess I ate most of the calamari so you can put that on my tab,&#034; let&#039;s not forget that he changed chairs at one point because the sun was in one of the lady&#039;s eyes and she needed some shade, so I have no idea what couple is together with whom now.  And the one guy wants to buy the first round everyone had, and asks you to put those cocktails on HIS tab.....but your printout only has a long line of drinks from the entire evening, and now your have to go around person by person and ask what they had for the first round....which takes another 2 minutes for them to remember....all while 7 other tables are looking at you like they want to kill you and the idiot table you have to listen to jumble their words and complain about the upcharge for Grey Goose in their Cosmo, which was listed at $8, but will now be $10 because you want top shelf.</p>
<p>That, hopefully, made any other servers reading this smile and chuckle, because you have seen this happen, verbatum.<br />
Granted, that&#039;s a nightmarish version, but when your income is based on keeping all tables pleased, and this &#034;supposedly simple two minute task&#034; takes 10 minutes (not to mention that some restaurants charge the servers for each credit card run...so thanks for handing me 7 cards) you start to get the picture.  Just look at the damn bill for a minute, hand me your card, and say $60 on this one, $40 on this one, and the rest on the Visa.  Boom.  You just saved me from going through a shit storm.</p>

      <p>Splitting a check is not the restaurant doing you a favour, it&#039;s you doing them a favour by &#034;joining tables&#034; and reducing their costs. If they are going to complain about splitting a check for a party of three, how about asking for three separate tables when you walk in? They will be out two extra tables, need extra waiters, will need to serve extra bread bowls, pitchers... etc. </p>
<p>So next time you walk in with a group, ask if there&#039;s a charge for splitting a check and added on automatic gratuity. If they say yes, tell them you are not a party of 8 but 8 separate customers that will occupy 8 tables and 8 servers. Watch their reaction.</p>

      <p>Splitting the check can be costly to the business because, take someone like myself who eats out with friends at the local wing joint.  You have a table of 10 people (no fixed gratuity) splitting a check 8 ways, that can be up to 8 credit card runs.  And it takes the server about 10-15 minutes to distribute the checks, collect the checks, run all of the tabs, make change (for the cash people), redistribute the final check, etc. which means she can&#039;t serve her other tables.  On the up side, people tend to tip better in larger groups with split tabs.  If my meal cost me $6, I feel bad about leaving any less than $2 and change, which is a 33% tip.  Most people tip high on smaller amounts.  On larger amounts, I pretty much stick to the 15% rule, give or take the individual.</p>

      <p>It&#039;s not the &#034;splitting&#034; part that&#039;s the problem, it&#039;s the credit card charges restaurants have to pay. It costs money every single time a card is run on the machine, depending on the credit card company it could be standard fee + percentage of sale. So, if every one in the party is splitting checks, it does cost the restaurant more to run all those cards.</p>

      <p>If you had ten tables with one person each, you&#039;d still run each credit card.  Otherwise you wouldn&#039;t be in business.</p>
<p>It should make no difference with a party of ten.  That&#039;s stupid to stay.  Would you rather just not have those patrons at all?  You&#039;re making a whole lot more than the fee takes away.</p>
<p>No I don&#039;t agree with credit card fees.  They&#039;re ridiculous.  But I can&#039;t do anything about it, and I can&#039;t always carry cash.</p>

      <p>And what city do you live in where restaurants charge a fee for splitting checks? Live in the &#039;burbs of Philadelphia and have gone out quite of few times with groups of 10-15 people and not once has there been an added fee when split checks were asked for.</p>

      <p>My opinion is if you set out to eat out you have to pay up. But the deal is this quality food and great service equals a great time and a memory. There are memories I continue to share about a Chinese restaurant that no longer is open, but the food was that good I&#039;d save my money from breakfast lunch and dinner just to eat there. That is worth the price.</p>

      <p>&#034;Even a few McDonald’s (them again?) got in on the action.&#034;</p>
<p>McD&#039;s, and other fast food restaurants, have to deal with customers who request a cup &#034;just for water&#034;, but then actually fill the cup up with soda.  It happen more than it doesn&#039;t.   It doesn&#039;t surprise me that these restaurants have resorted to charging for a water because, as I said, it usually isn&#039;t water that goes into the cup.</p>

      <p>Soft drinks at fast food restaurants are the most marked up item in the world, short of printer ink. There is a 6000% mark-up on your soft drink. That means if only 1 person bought a soft drink, a store could give a free soda to nearly every other customer for the rest of the day, and still make a profit.</p>

      <p>Yes, soft drinks (and tea, lemonade, similar) are expensive, but also remember you get unlimited refills at MOST restaurants.  Now, I typically opt for water because I know that soda is just empty calories that I don&#039;t really crave all that much, but no matter what sits in front of me, I can typically be on my 2nd refill by the time my meal comes.  The average cost is about $2.50-$3 for a soft drink, and if you only drink one glass, that&#039;s about a 5x mark-up to what you would spend on the equivalent volume at your local 7-11&#039;s fountain dispenser.  But as you drink up, 2-3 glasses later, you&#039;re pretty much on par with the cheapest fountain drinks on the market.</p>

      <p>And why is the soda dispenser self serve? Because it is such a high profit item, it doesn&#039;t matter, also they are saving on labor, not having to pour the drinks. The drive through gets priority anyway, might as well stay in the car.</p>

First, it&#039;s restaurant made if it&#039;s made in the restaurant, which most food isn&#039;t.<br />

      <p>Your article is ridiculous.  When people split plates, they generally receive bigger portions than the &#034;half&#034; they should receive.  Guests know they save money, and get more food, ultimately.  Moreover, the extra 1-2$ for the Rocks pour is due to the fact that drinks with mixers, as a standard have 1 1/2 ounce pours.  Drinks on the &#034;rocks&#034; are a 2 ounce pour.  The extra money is for the additional 1/2 ounce of booze.  I have worked in the business for 20 years, and I have NEVER been to a place that charges for tap water.</p>

      <p>I can see if one entrée was ordered for two people.   The are costs for the extra plate, extra silverware, extra napkins, and so on.   However, if the number of entrées equals the number of customers, and they are truly passing the food around and sampling a bit of everything, then there should not be a charge.</p>

      <p>Did you even read the article? The author acknowledged that if the restaurant splits the meal and prepares the two portions, a split plate fee is warranted &#8211; his gripe was with charging simply for an extra plate, with the diners doing the splitting themselves. Your argument &#8211; that the guests get bigger portions &#8211; would only apply if the restaurant is doing the splitting. Some great restaurants do this, and as part of the fee, the diners get extra portions of the side dishes and/or salads.</p>

<p>First off, they explained the pour difference in the article.  Did you bother to read it?  If so, why repeat something they said, only make it sound like they never explained it?  Makes zero sense.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the case of splitting portions, he talked about asking for an extra plate, which does NOT result in more of a portion, does it, Einstein?</p>
<p>So, you have been in the business for 20 years and have never seen a place charge for tap water.  How many places are there in the world, and how many have you been to?  Less than 1%, I bet.

      <p>On the contrary, YOUR attitude is ridiculous. Maggie is just stating her opinions, and you&#039;re the one attacking her and calling her a bitch, which is completely unwarranted. Time for you to get off the internet and end your power trip...</p>

      <p>Go to Europe. Every restaurant charges for tap water. Sonic Drive-in? Charges for tap water. There&#039;s a few thousand examples for you.</p>

      <p>In the EU it is illegal for premises licenced to serve alcohol (i.e. the vast majority of restaurants) to charge for tap water. I&#039;ve never come across a restaurant that charges for tap water on either side of the Atlantic, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.</p>

      <p>the few places I&#039;ve ever been to that charged for tap water was like 5 or 10 cents, not the same $2 they charge for a soda. And that was just to offset the cost of the to-go or cleaning the cup more than the water. But yeah, I&#039;ve almost never been to any place that charges for tap water, either.</p>

      <p>The handful of folks that I know that would &#034;split&#034; their plate always did so themselves at the table. They would order the one meal, two drinks and then eat off the same plate or used one of those bread &amp; butter plates put on the table.  With this, there was no extra food being served for that &#034;split&#034; plate.</p>

      <p>Because they charge you for stuff when you want extra? If a restaurant gives extras away like there is no tomorrow it doesn&#039;t mean they are friendlier, it means their food cost is ridiculously cheap and they&#039;re making a ton of money off you anyway. Chain restaurants have less of a problem with it, but locally or individually owned restaurants can live or die by a tight budget, especially if they are just starting out.</p>
