   U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during swearing-in ceremonies on the
   West front of the U.S Capitol in Washington, January 21, 2013. &nbsp;
   REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES &nbsp;- Tags: POLITICS)
   In a [29]powerful second inauguration speech, President Barack Obama
   cast the history of the United States as a history of struggle, and its
   future in the same terms.

     For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident,
     they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift
     from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth. The
     patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with
     the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob. They gave to us a
     Republic, a government of, and by, and for the people, entrusting
     each generation to keep safe our founding creed.

     For more than two hundred years, we have.

     Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned
     that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality
     could survive half-slave and half-free. We made ourselves anew, and
     vowed to move forward together.

   Obama sketched out a broad vision of the struggles we face today, to
   move forward in the way the nation moved forward by declaring
   independence or by abolishing slavery. He was explicit about the
   threats posed by climate change, and the work needed to address it:

     We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the
     failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.
     Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none
     can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling
     drought, and more powerful storms. The path towards sustainable
     energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America
     cannot resist this transition; we must lead it.

   Invoking the fights for equal rights of "Seneca Falls, and Selma, and
   Stonewall," Obama addressed the continuing need for a movement for
   equality, linking equal pay, marriage equality, voting rights, and
   immigration reform:

     [O]ur journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers, and
     daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts. Our journey is
     not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like
     anyone else under the law--for if we are truly created equal, then
     surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. Our
     journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours
     to exercise the right to vote. Our journey is not complete until we
     find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who
     still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young
     students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than
     expelled from our country.

   In this speech, Obama laid out a moral vision for America, grounded in
   the nation's own history and its current debates. We know how hard the
   fight to put Obama's vision into practice will be--we've seen it time
   and time again in the past struggles he cited, and we see it every day
   in the extremism of today's Republicans. But it's a promising note on
   which to kick off his second term.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [43]Tagging tips - [44]Search For Tags - [45]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [46]Civil
   Rights, [47]Community, [48]Congress, [49]Culture, [50]Economy,
   [51]Education, [52]Elections, [53]Energy, [54]Environment, [55]Health
   Care, [56]International, [57]Labor, [58]Law, [59]Media, [60]Meta,
   [61]National Security, [62]Science, [63]Transportation, or [64]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([65]California, [66]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 In years to come this will be remembered ([151]0+ / 0-)
       as one of his best speeches methinks. What was it George Washington
       used 135 words in an Inaugural address and William Henry Harrison
       talked for over an hour in the cold and rain and then died soon
       after. I think Obama covered all the important bases and hit a home
       run.
       Our money system is not what we have been led to believe. The
       creation of money has been "privatized," or taken over by private
       money lenders. Thomas Jefferson called them "bold and bankrupt

   Actually, I was very impressed. The theme of ongoing struggle and that
   "we the people" need to get way better organized if we want to overcome
   the obstruction of the greedy robber barons.

   I was especially harkened by POTUS' reference that we should claim the
   peace created by our fathers and grandfathers, who turned sworn enemies
   (japan and germany) into the best of friends. His repudiation of waging
   war in perpetuity is not a way to achieve peace.

   I also like POTUS' repdiation of Paul Ryan's claim that libs and
   minorities are "takers." But rather that we "take" risks to reach out
   for better opportunity.

   the Republican brand is totally bankrupt.

       If Boehner keeps letting stuff get voted on, the Teahadists might
       actually go into business for themselves and start a REAL political
       party. God knows the Koch's and Wal-Mart Waldman would foot the
       bill. At that point, the "sane, mainstream Republicans" would "take

       I am reminded of Gene Robinson's invocation before the inaugural
       concert in 2009.  Which HBO chose to withhold from us.

     And God, we give you thanks for your child Barack, as he assumes the
     office of President of the United States.

     Give him wisdom beyond his years, and inspire him with Lincoln's
     reconciling leadership style, President Kennedy's ability to enlist
     our best efforts, and Dr. King's dream of a nation for ALL the
     people.
     Give him a quiet heart, for our Ship of State needs a steady, calm
     captain in these times.
     Give him stirring words, for we will need to be inspired and
     motivated to make the personal and common sacrifices necessary to
     facing the challenges ahead.
     Make him color-blind, reminding him of his own words that under his
     leadership, there will be neither red nor blue states, but the
     United States.
     Help him remember his own oppression as a minority, drawing on that
     experience of discrimination, that he might seek to change the lives
     of those who are still its victims.
     Give him the strength to find family time and privacy, and help him
     remember that even though he is president, a father only gets one
     shot at his daughters' childhoods.
     And please, God, keep him safe. We know we ask too much of our
     presidents, and we're asking FAR too much of this one. We know the
     risk he and his wife are taking for all of us, and we implore you, O
     good and great God, to keep him safe. Hold him in the palm of your
     hand - that he might do the work we have called him to do, that he
     might find joy in this impossible calling, and that in the end, he
     might lead us as a nation to a place of integrity, prosperity and
     peace.

       Probably the worst part about our political system is that the

       getting ready for the next election campaign. That seems to
       especially be the case in the House, where they're less concerned
       with what's good for the country and more concerned with how they
       look in the media.

   instead of a right wing homophobe we get Medgar Evers's widow for the

   Then we get a highly integrated choir from Brooklyn - part of that area
   that got no disaster $$ - singing the Battle Hymn of Republic!
   Essentially the theme song of the Union during the Civil War. Holy
   moley! I think McConnell and Graham must have been fit to be tied.

   Then the speech itself, which was very throw down the gauntlet in tone,
   I thought. America has always done this and thought this way and made
   things happen when things needed doing, and we better regain that
   stride if we expect to stay in this game.

   I thought it had a very welcome "no more Mr. Nice Guy" tone to it.

   "We the people" used by the Paulites & 'baggers and each section has a
   historical core that will make this speech classic; note the repeated
   references to a broader notion of creed as well as the constitutional
   protection of human rights

     But we have always understood that when times change, so must we;
     that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to
     new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately
     requires collective action.  For the American people can no more
     meet the demands of today's world by acting alone than American
     soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with
     muskets and militias.  No single person can train all the math and
     science teachers we'll need to equip our children for the future, or
     build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new
     jobs and businesses to our shores.  Now, more than ever, we must do
     these things together, as one nation, and one people.

     We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are
     not just to ourselves, but to all posterity.  We will respond to the
     threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would
     betray our children and future generations.  Some may still deny the
     overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating
     impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful
     storms.  The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long
     and sometimes difficult.  But America cannot resist this transition;
     we must lead it.  We cannot cede to other nations the technology
     that will power new jobs and new industries - we must claim its
     promise.  That is how we will maintain our economic vitality and our
     national treasure - our forests and waterways; our croplands and
     snowcapped peaks.  That is how we will preserve our planet,
     commanded to our care by God.  That's what will lend meaning to the
     creed our fathers once declared...
     We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of
     arms and rule of law.  We will show the courage to try and resolve
     our differences with other nations peacefully - not because we are
     naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more
     durably lift suspicion and fear.  America will remain the anchor of
     strong alliances in every corner of the globe; and we will renew
     those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad,
     for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most
     powerful nation.  We will support democracy from Asia to Africa;
     from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our
     conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom.
      And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the
     marginalized, the victims of prejudice - not out of mere charity,
     but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those
     principles that our common creed describes:  tolerance and
     opportunity; human dignity and justice.

     We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths - that
     all of us are created equal - is the star that guides us still; just
     as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and
     Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and

       change getting serious recognition.  And then, the stress on gay
       equality, gays as full participants in the civil rights movement
       and in the country's fabric.  A real defense of the value of
       government and interconnectedness of society.  A full-throated
       response and rebuke to the hyper-individualism of the GOP.  A great

 Seneca Falls ([1006]0+ / 0-)
       [1007]http://en.wikipedia.org/...

     The Seneca Falls Convention was an early and influential women's
     rights convention, the first to be organized by women in the Western
     world, in Seneca Falls, New York, July 19-20, 1848. It was planned
     by local New York women upon the occasion of a visit by
     Philadelphia-based Lucretia Mott, a Quaker famous for her orating
     ability, a skill rarely cultivated by American women at the time.
     The local women, primarily members of a radical Quaker group,
     organized the meeting along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a skeptical
     non-Quaker who followed logic more than religion.

     The meeting spanned two days and six sessions, and included a
     lecture on law, a humorous presentation, and multiple discussions
     about the role of women in society. Stanton and the Quaker women
     presented two prepared documents, the Declaration of Sentiments and
     an accompanying list of resolutions, to be debated and modified
     before being put forward for signatures. A heated debate sprang up
     regarding women's right to vote, with many including Mott urging the
     removal of this concept, but Frederick Douglass argued eloquently
     for its inclusion, and the suffrage resolution was retained. Exactly
     100 of approximately 300 attendees signed the document, mostly
     women.

   "Why are you crying, baby," my SO asked.

   "That voice," I said. "It goes back to my childhood..."

   What I was thinking as I was crying: "My generation... We're the adults
   now... and we're in charge!" It is truly our turn, because it wasn't

   that will be eventful, perhaps decisive, for us and for the world.

   It may be our lot to experience, and in large measure to bring about, a
   major turning point in the long history of the human race. The first
   half of this century has been marked by unprecedented and brutal
   attacks on the rights of man, and by the two most frightful wars in
   history. The supreme need of our time is for men to learn to live
   together in peace and harmony.

   The peoples of the earth face the future with grave uncertainty,
   composed almost equally of great hopes and great fears. In this time of
   doubt, they look to the United States as never before for good will,
   strength, and wise leadership.

   It is fitting, therefore, that we take this occasion to proclaim to the
   world the essential principles of the faith by which we live, and to
   declare our aims to all peoples.

   The American people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this
   Nation from the beginning. We believe that all men have a right to
   equal justice under law and equal opportunity to share in the common
   good. We believe that all men have the right to freedom of thought and
   expression. We believe that all men are created equal because they are
   created in the image of God.

   From this faith we will not be moved.

   The American people desire, and are determined to work for, a world in
   which all nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves as they
   see fit, and to achieve a decent and satisfying life. Above all else,
   our people desire, and are determined to work for, peace on earth--a
   just and lasting peace--based on genuine agreement freely arrived at by
   equals."

   The next paragraphs are used to chastise people who present a competing
   and false view of the world and the future.

   nor am I one of "His people".  Obama made these statements as if they

   My freedoms and rights are given to me by the Constitution, the Bill of

   (who are supposed to not legislate religious ideas- we've blown that

       a bone to non-believers. He's done it a couple of times. But then
       he expanded the faith based programs which are a clear violation of
       church/state. He balked at his promise to stop faith based fund
       receivers from hiring discrimination. He hired a Pentacostal
       minister on our tax dime to advise him and pray with him every day
       (Joshua DuBois).  He formed a council of religious representatives
       of faith based fund receievers to advise him on government policy
       concerning the funds they are receiving (foxes guarding the hen
       house?).  He went to the National Prayer Breakfast last year
       claiming he was there as a representative of the American people
       (read Jeff Sharlet's The Family to find out why the President
       should not even enter the room with those people).
       He has said the pretty words about non-believers. But his actions
       have said something else completely. Now when it comes to religion,
       I don't understand him or trust him very much.

       my view needs to be taken into account. I also think that just
       because the immersion of religion into our "country's narrative"
       has been the story...the story can change. In fact, it needs to be
       changed. Atheists need to take a stand somewhere.  Our Constitution
       was written without "appeal to divine sources" as John Adams wrote.
       Yet our government now appeals to the divine every chance it gets
       and that is a recipe for danger.  Ignoring it won't make it to
       away, and actually assists it to move into more violations down the
       road.  James Madison worried about this in his Essay on Monopolies.
        He saw the innate raw aggressive power of the Abrahamic religions.
        No matter how many lines you draw in the sand, they will always
       cross them and want more.
       While I am tolerant of religionists and work with them in
       separation of church/state groups, I am fast losing my ability to

   They are shitting their pants right now. They're howling that Obama
   didn't promise to compromise, or be nice, and claim that he's obligated
   to pursue GOP policies.

   I finally feel that I have a President who considers me to be a
   dignified human being. I thought that when he made the brave choice to
   come out for marriage equality, and I think it now. I have a lot of
   quibbles with the President, but no one can say that he does not
   support the dignity of all human beings. The climate change stuff was
   pretty awesome, too.

   Without this reform K Street, which is the true enemy of Progress, can
   buy all of Kongress simply by buy buying one single Senator and since
   most of them ( in both parties ) are already bought and paid, for that
   means none of these lofty goals can be achieved - unless we change the
   Rules and change them now - not promise to do it in the future if

 Fun Fact: ExxonMobil "donated" $250,000 ([1565]0+ / 0-)

   toward the Obama Inauguration.

   Let's see Mother Earth come up with that kind of scratch or better,
   because $250,000 is  a lot of status quo on climate change, not action.

   Unlike the last inauguration (where no corporate cash was not
   accepted), the $50 million dollar goal is taking money from all
   corporate comers.  Fine upstanding companies like Bank of America,
   Genentech and AT&T.

   So while big words will be spoken today at events costing multiple
   millions, remember that the favors garnered by funding them will pay
   back the corporations seven-fold (or more).

 Comments on JFK inaugural, 1961 ([1583]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1584]Minnesota Deb

   Kennedy gave his "Ask not" speech.  The poet was Robert Frost.  We
   lived in D.C., and it was freezing-ass cold, so we stayed home and
   watched it on black-and-white TV.

   The next day I went to school (I was in the fifth grade).  There was a
   girl in my class who'd been for Nixon. This girl and I had developed a
   rather reserved and grown-up debating style. She would debate by
   telling me what her father thought, which was basically that "Kennedy
   is nothing but that criminal Roosevelt, only he can walk." I would say
   things like "Nyah, nyah, Nixon lost," and then I'd make an armpit fart
   at her.

   Anyway, on January 21, 1961, I said "Nyah nyah, Kennedy got
   inaugurated," and she said "My FATHER says Kennedy STOLE his whole
   speech from ROOSEVELT," and I made more armpit farts at her.

   Maybe I can find her on Facebook or something, and we could work for
   FOX.
