Scott Gessler won't intimidate us on election day, Latino groups say

   Eliseo Medina
   Secretary of State Scott Gessler has a Republican agenda and is trying
   to prevent Latinos and new citizens from voting on election day. At
   least that's the charge from a group of left-leaning advocacy
   organizations working to get Hispanic voters to the polls in Colorado.
   Gessler's office, however, is pushing back against their criticisms,
   noting that his registration drive helped sign up more Democrats than
   Republicans.

   Earlier this week, Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service
   Employees International Union, made a stop in Colorado with advocacy
   group [167]Mi Familia Vota and representatives from several social
   justice groups to discuss the upcoming elections, the importance of the
   Latino vote and how the issue of immigration fits into the campaigns
   this cycle. Much of the conversation focused on immigration and how a
   strong showing of Latino voters and new citizens at the polls this year
   will help build the foundation for comprehensive immigration reform in
   years to come.

                          [168]Eliseo Medina.JPG

   But there was also a fair amount of dissent and anger surrounding the
   Republican Secretary of State, who has faced backlash in the months
   leading up to the election for his efforts to [169]weed out illegal
   immigrant voters and [170]prevent voter fraud.

   The groups that regularly oppose Gessler often argue that his
   [171]priorities are wrong and that he is spending too much time on a
   wild goose chase to find voter fraud, which they believe is very rare.
   Some say this concern is compounded by the fact that there is a certain
   level of [172]incompetence and [173]dysfunction in his office's basic
   elections operations.

   Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper recently told us that [174]he
   thinks Gessler may be intimidating voters, but that he probably means
   well and doesn't actually have partisan motives in his efforts.

   Still, the civic groups that met this week took the criticism of
   Gessler a step further, maintaining that it's clear the Secretary of
   State is using his position as chief election officer to try and
   advance a Republican cause and stop Obama supporters from going to the
   polls. Gessler's office, which continually emphasizes that he has spent
   a lot of resources and money on [175]encouraging registration,
   dismisses these accusations as absurd and out-of-touch with reality.

   "They all yell voter fraud, but don't come forward with any proof,"
   Medina said. "They [176]send letters to everybody saying you may not be
   eligible to vote...and the objective is to confuse and intimidate
   people from voting. And if they send it to 4,000, 5,000 people and they
   can scare and intimidate 10 percent, those are people that won't come
   out. Because their theory is, if we can't convince them to vote for us,
   let's keep them from voting."

   With Gessler, Medina said, "It has nothing to do with voter fraud. It
   has more to do with politics and how to control who votes and who
   doesn't for partisan gain."

   Medina added that this is especially important in Colorado, where the
   Latino vote is becoming very influential.

   "Colorado is really at the tipping point in its politics to where I
   think the Latino vote...will be the decisive vote," he said.

   And in Colorado, [177]a key swing state that is split right down the
   middle, every vote counts, Gessler's critics feel.

   "What's so infuriating about what he is doing is...we're talking about
   a 1 percent or less than 1 percent margin in Colorado right now," said
   Patty Kupfer, managing director with America's Voice, an immigration
   reform group. "The Latino vote is all that much more important because
   of that razor-thin margin. So if he succeeds in keeping 200 people from
   voting, that could be the margin in Colorado this time. It's just
   scary."

   Jennifer Piper, an interfaith organizer with American Friends Service
   Committee, said that voters have lost their trust in the Secretary of
   State.

   "Gessler has shown himself to be someone who holds partisan politics
   above protecting the right that people have to vote -- and that's come
   through pretty clearly, even in very conservative congregations," she
   said.

   Continue for response from Gessler's office and for the latest Colorado
   polling of Latino voters.
