Rachel Maddow Celebrates 'Historic Week' In Gay Rights Movement (VIDEO)

   Rachel Maddow ended her Friday show by celebrating what she called a
   historic week in the gay rights movement in America.

   In a poetic monologue that seemed at times to leave her slightly choked
   up, Maddow compared the effect of the work done by pioneers in the
   fight for LGBT equality -- from now-dead activists of the 1970s to Edie
   Windsor, the widow of Thea Spyer, whose [272]lawsuit against the
   Defense of Marriage Act was heard by the Supreme Court this week -- to
   the light that reaches the night sky from stars that have actually been
   gone for years.

   "There are all sorts of people and all sorts of fights that technically
   are not still around," she said. "But they live, and we can see them.
   We can see their light in some of the biggest-deal and most difficult
   things that we do today. Whether or not you see equal rights for gay
   people as your particular fight -- whether or not you even agree with
   that particular fight--this was a really big historic week for that
   fight, and therefore for our country. All the work, all the generations
   of work to get here, in fact, got us here. It worked."

   CORRECTION: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that
   Spyer was Windsor's widow; it is the reverse.
