[111]Reza Aslan: Why I write about Jesus

   Opinion by Reza Aslan, special to CNN

   (CNN) - When I was 15 years old, I found Jesus.

   I spent the summer of my sophomore year at an evangelical youth camp in
   Northern California, a place of timbered fields and boundless blue
   skies, where, given enough time and stillness and soft-spoken
   encouragement, one could not help but hear the voice of God.

   Amid the man-made lakes and majestic pines my friends and I sang songs,
   played games and swapped secrets, rollicking in our freedom from the
   pressures of home and school.

   In the evenings, we gathered in a fire-lit assembly hall at the center
   of the camp. It was there that I heard a remarkable story that would
   change my life forever.

   Two thousand years ago, I was told, in an ancient land called Galilee,
   the God of heaven and Earth was born in the form of a helpless child.
   The child grew into a blameless man. The man became the Christ, the
   savior of humanity.

   Through his words and miraculous deeds, he challenged the Jews who
   thought they were the chosen of God, and in return he was nailed to a
   cross. Though Jesus could have saved himself from that gruesome death,
   he freely chose to die.

   Indeed, his death was the point of it all, for his sacrifice freed us
   all from the burden of our sins.

   But the story did not end there, because three days later, he rose
   again, exalted and divine, so that now, all who believe in him and
   accept him into their hearts will also never die, but have eternal
   life.

   For a kid raised in a motley family of lukewarm Muslims and exuberant
   atheists, this was truly the greatest story ever told. Never before had
   I felt so intimately the pull of God.

   In Iran, the place of my birth, I was Muslim in much the way I was
   Persian. My religion and my ethnicity were mutual and linked. Like most
   people born into a religious tradition, my faith was as familiar to me
   as my skin, and just as disregardable.

   After the Iranian revolution forced my family to flee our home,
   religion in general, and Islam in particular, became taboo in our
   household. Islam was shorthand for everything we had lost to the
   mullahs who now ruled Iran.

   My mother still prayed when no one was looking, and you could still
   find a stray Quran or two hidden in a closet or a drawer somewhere.
   But, for the most part, our lives were scrubbed of all trace of God.

   That was just fine with me. After all, in the America of the 1980s,
   being Muslim was like being from Mars. My faith was a bruise, the most
   obvious symbol of my otherness; it needed to be concealed.

   Jesus, on the other hand, was America. He was the central figure in
   America's national drama. Accepting him into my heart was as close as I
   could get to feeling truly American.

   I do not mean to say that mine was a conversion of convenience. On the
   contrary, I burned with absolute devotion to my newfound faith.

   I was presented with a Jesus who was less "Lord and Savior" than he was
   a best friend, someone with whom I could have a deep and personal
   relationship. As a teenager trying to make sense of an indeterminate
   world I had only just become aware of, this was an invitation I could
   not refuse.

   The moment I returned home from camp, I began eagerly to share the good
   news of Jesus Christ with my friends and family, my neighbors and
   classmates, with people I'd just met and with strangers on the street:
   those who heard it gladly, and those who threw it back in my face.

   Yet something unexpected happened in my quest to save the souls of the
   world.

   The more I probed the Bible to arm myself against the doubts of
   unbelievers, the more distance I discovered between the Jesus of the
   Gospels and the Jesus of history - between Jesus the Christ and Jesus
   of Nazareth.

   In college, where I began my formal study of the history of religions,
   that initial discomfort soon ballooned into full-blown doubts.

   The bedrock of evangelical Christianity, at least as it was taught to
   me, is the unconditional belief that every word of the Bible is
   God-breathed and true, literal and inerrant.

   The sudden realization that this belief is patently and irrefutably
   false, that the Bible is replete with the most blatant and obvious
   errors and contradictions -- just as one would expect from a document
   written by hundreds of different hands across thousands of years --
   left me confused and spiritually unmoored.

   And so, like many people in my situation, I angrily discarded my faith
   as if it were a costly forgery I had been duped into buying.

   I began to rethink the faith and culture of my forefathers, finding in
   them a deeper, more intimate familiarity than I ever had as a child,
   the kind that comes from reconnecting with an old friend after many
   years apart.

   Meanwhile, I continued my academic work in religious studies, delving
   back into the Bible not as an unquestioning believer but as an
   inquisitive scholar. No longer chained to the assumption that the
   stories I read were literally true, I became aware of a more meaningful
   truth in the text.

   Ironically, the more I learned about the life of the historical Jesus,
   the turbulent world in which he lived, and the brutality of the Roman
   occupation that he defied, the more I was drawn to him.

   The Jewish peasant and revolutionary who challenged the rule of the
   most powerful empire the world had ever known became so much more real
   to me than the detached, unearthly being I had been introduced to in
   church.

   Today, I can confidently say that two decades of rigorous academic
   research into the origins of Christianity has made me a more genuinely
   committed disciple of Jesus of Nazareth than I ever was of Jesus
   Christ.

   I have modeled my life not after the celestial spirit whom many
   Christians believe sacrificed himself for our sins, but rather after
   the illiterate, marginal Jew who gave his life fighting an unwinnable
   battle against the religious and political powers of his day on behalf
   of the poor and the dispossessed - those his society deemed unworthy of
   saving.

   I wrote my newest book, [112]"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of
   Nazareth" in order to spread the good news of the Jesus of history with
   the same fervor that I once applied to spreading the story of the
   Christ.

   Because I am convinced that one can be a devoted follower of Jesus
   without being a Christian, just as I know that one can be a Christian
   without being a follower of Jesus.

   Reza Aslan is a bestselling author and a scholar of religion. This
   article was adapted from his newest book, [113]"Zealot: The Life and
   Times of Jesus of Nazareth." The views expressed in this column are
   Aslan's alone.

       Same reason why western writers write about Islam and Muhammed. Its
       not like he insulted Jesus, its just his point of view and
       understanding.

            So, what does any of what you write have to do with the
            article at hand, other than shameless self-promotion?

       The best part abut Christians is when they claim that whatever they
       do doesn't matter because so long as they believe in Jesus then
       they're "saved". That's great. Torture an innocent child to death,
       but get a free pass into heaven because you believe in Jesus. Yes,
       human psychology is completely capable of believing the Jesus while
       still torturing a child to death. The simpler example are all the
       drug dealers and Wall Street bankers running around with crosses
       hanging around their necks. Evangelical Christianity has managed to
       invent for itself the belief that being truly penitent about your
       actions doesn't really matter any more. All you have to do is
       believe in Jesus and you've got a "get out of jail free" card. At
       least the Catholic Church still tries to wrap the "truly penitent"
       requirement into the requirement of confession. I'm not advocating
       for the Catholic Church or pretending that many (most?) Catholics
       don't perform confession without any real penitence, but at least
       the CONCEPT of confessing is an effort in the right direction.

            Here again cast iron evidence of the fallacy of religion.
            remember that catholics are sworn to believe that they are
            actually consuming human flesh and blood during communion.
            There was a time when failure to swear that you believed in
            what is known as "TRANSUBSTANTIATION" was punished by BURNING
            AT THE STAKE.
            YES they would burn you ALIVE, these wonderful god fearing
            christians.
