Atlanta police union defends using traffic tickets to fund pay increases

   By Holly Yan and Victor Blackwell, CNN
   updated 9:22 AM EDT, Wed June 26, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Atlanta has designated traffic court and ticket revenue for future
       pay increases
     * Union chief: We're trying to correct inefficiencies and hold those
       accountable for tickets already written
     * Tucson's police chief requires officers to make at least one
       traffic stop a day
     * He says the stops often yield greater benefits, such as narcotics
       arrests and warrants served

   (CNN) -- It's a theory many drivers have held since their first
   speeding ticket, that citations are somehow connected to a special perk
   for the officer writing it.

   Now, a memo among Atlanta police officers has reignited such
   suspicions.

   "The mayor has designated traffic court and ticket revenue for future
   pay increases," Atlanta Police Union President Ken Allen wrote this
   month.

   Some residents scoffed at the idea.

   "I'm probably going to switch from sales and join the police force in
   that case, if that's the way it's working," one resident, Ken Miller,
   [41]told CNN affiliate WSB-TV.

   But Allen stressed that while revenue from tickets will be earmarked
   for raises, more tickets will not necessarily lead to higher raises.

   "We're not even asking anybody, or no one has made any suggestion, that
   any officer write any additional tickets than they already have," the
   union president told CNN.

   "The revenues from tickets already go to the general fund. What the
   mayor has suggested doing is ... earmarking where these revenues are
   going for the future pay raises."

   Allen said revenues have decreased, but it's largely because of the
   dismissal rates of citations and an inefficient court system. He said
   many traffic cases get dismissed because officers can't make it to the
   scheduled court appearance.

   "The citizens need to understand ... we're not running a ticket revenue
   stream just to get a pay increase. All we're trying to do is correct
   the inefficiencies and hold those accountable for citations we've
   already written."

   But former police officer and TV judge Alex Ferrer said he's concerned
   about the possible effects of linking ticket revenues directly to pay
   increases.

   "Once you tie something to somebody's financial earnings, they are
   motivated in a way that they are not motivated before," he said.

   But many officers say traffic stops yield a lot more benefits than just
   improved road safety and revenue.

   Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor requires his officers to make an
   average of at least one traffic stop a day. He said many important
   arrests stem from traffic stops.

   "That's where we get most of our narcotic arrests. We get a lot of
   warrants we've been able to serve," Villasenor told [42]CNN affiliate
   KGUN. "There's benefit from traffic (stops) that have been proven in
   city after city. I'm just saying we can't forget that's part of our
   job."
