   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [50]Tagging tips - [51]Search For Tags - [52]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       But I don't know that its really true that changing the name would
       bring in a ton more revenue. As I posted earlier today on this
       thread [136]http://www.dailykos.com/... a recent (May 2013) poll
       shows that 79% of football fans and 79% of the general public think
       the Washington football team should keep its current name.
       [137]http://www.cbssports.com/.... What this says to me is that is
       that the team's (and the league's bottom line) is more likely to be
       negatively impacted by changing the name than by keeping it. The
       NFL is a business, and until these views are reversed the name
       isn't going anywhere. That means we need to work on changing the
       attitudes that support the name. The CBS Sports article indicates
       that there was a 10% shift against the name (from 89% in support to
       79% in support) since the early 1990s, but that still leaves a long
       way to go.

   winter rabbit's excellent diary today, [273]RedSK--S & HATE CRIMES.
   Maybe they'll understand people actually skinned Native Americans
   during the invasion! A snip:

     Disgustingly so, "Redskin Indians" refers to literally skinning
     American Indians. "But his (Jackson's) Indian Fighters had a very
     peculiar preoccupation, that was skinning the Indians on the
     battlefield. They used to make pants" it says in the video. Reverend
     Goat Carson, who is "Internationally recognized for his
     presentations," discusses it in "REDSKIN A 500 YEAR HATE CRIME."

   Maybe I'm being an ignorant Euro-invader-spawn, but I figured the
   Blackhawks kind of got a pass or better because, a) they're
   namechecking/honoring a tribe, not naming themselves after an epithet,
   b) their logo is pretty respectful seems to me (been seeing it a lot at
   center ice these days), and c) the tribe, with a legendary warrior
   tradition, had a presence in the area where the team plays.  Not
   unlike, going out on a limb here...the Florida State Seminoles?

   The few Native Americans I've talked to about this in general don't
   mind respectful recognition (not at all), just ignorant caricatures and
   dumb-ass mascots.

   The Washington Congress Critters!

 Our HS team, The Shamrocks, just got not respect. ([508]0+ / 0-)

   What's in a name?

 But football is all about ignoring bad things... ([511]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [512]PSzymeczek

   ...as a group!  High school.  Authoritarian upbringings.  A narrow
   vision of social cohesion and teamwork.  Consistent, traumatic brain
   injury in exchange for a salary lottery.   F-18 flyovers and jingoistic
   rhetoric.  Why not name your football team after an epithet for the
   indigenes we killed to get this place?

   ...j'ai découvert que tout le malheur des hommes vient d'une seule
   chose, qui est de ne savoir pas demeurer en repos dans une chambre.

 The whole thing goes back ([515]0+ / 0-)

   to the original owner of the team, back to when they were in Bostom.
   George Preston Maarshall's racism was legendary.

   You can't keep a mighty tree alive (much less expect it to thrive) by
   only spritzing the fine leaves at its tippy-top. The fate of the whole
   tree depends on nurturing the grassroots. - Jim Hightower
