Obama: U.S. concludes Syria carried out chemical weapons attacks

   By Fred Pleitgen. Josh Levs and Chelsea J. Carter, CNN
   updated 9:33 PM EDT, Wed August 28, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Germany and Britain agree "Syria cannot continue unpunished"
     * President Barack Obama says no decision has been made on Syria
       strike
     * Obama tells PBS that Syria carried out chemical attacks
     * Syria says rebels obtained materials for chemical weapons from
       other countries

   Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- The United States has concluded Syria carried
   out chemical weapons attacks against its people, President Barack Obama
   said Wednesday, a claim that comes amid a looming diplomatic showdown
   over whether to strike against Bashar al-Assad's military.

   Obama's declaration to "PBS NewsHour" came at the end of a day that saw
   Russia and China walk out of a U.N. Security Council meeting as word
   surfaced Britain planned to pursue a resolution to authorize the use of
   force against Syria, even as United Nations weapons inspectors were in
   Syria assessing whether chemical weapons have been used.

   "We do not believe that, given the delivery systems, using rockets,
   that the opposition could have carried out these attacks. We have
   concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out," Obama
   told "NewsHour."

   "And if that's so, then there need to be international consequences,"
   the president added.

   Obama said that he has "not made a decision" about whether to conduct a
   military strike in Syria.

   Allegations of a chemical weapons attack carried out by al-Assad's
   forces in a Damascus suburb last week triggered the international
   machinations, which have been growing as body counts on both sides in
   the more-than-2-year-old civil war have increased.

   Those who claimed to have survived the alleged chemical weapons attack
   described a horrific scene in the town of Zamalka.

   "After the chemicals, they woke us up and told us to put masks on," a
   6-year-old boy said, describing the alleged attack.

   "I told my dad I can't breathe. My father then fainted and I fainted
   right after that, but we were found and taken to the emergency room."

   CNN obtained video of the boy and others who made the claims to a
   journalist in the area.

   U.N. Security Council deadlocked on Syria
   The woman behind al- Assad's regime
   What a U.S. strike on Syria might entail

   Al-Assad's government has blamed rebels for carrying out the attack, a
   claim that Obama told PBS was impossible.

   "We have looked at all the evidence, and we do not believe the
   opposition possessed ... chemical weapons of that sort," he said. "We
   do not believe that, given the delivery systems, using rockets, that
   the opposition could have carried out these attacks."

   In the video obtained by CNN, one man claimed he evacuated two dead
   bodies during the attack. "Then there was another explosion. I couldn't
   breathe, I had cramps and I couldn't see. The doctors helped me."

   The horror of the attack on civilians has jolted the world into
   potential action on a crisis that has killed more than 100,000 people,
   according to the United Nations.

   Last week was not the first time chemical weapons are believed to have
   been used in the conflict. But it was by far the worst.

   [41]'Red line' debate: Chemical weapons worse than attacks?

   "Syria is now undoubtedly the most serious crisis facing the
   international community," Lakhdar Brahimi, U.N. and Arab League special
   envoy to Syria, said Wednesday in Geneva.

   "It does seem that some kind of substance was used that killed a lot of
   people," he said. The death toll could be in the hundreds, or possibly
   more than a thousand, he said.

   Brahimi said the crisis in Syria shows how important it is "for the
   Syrians and the international community to really develop the political
   will to address this issue seriously and look for solutions for it."

   NATO also followed suit with a warning of its own Wednesday.

   "The Syrian regime maintains custody of stockpiles of chemical weapons.
   Information available from a wide variety of sources points to the
   Syrian regime as responsible for the use of chemical weapons in these
   attacks. This is a clear breach of long-standing international norms
   and practice.

   "Any use of such weapons is unacceptable and cannot go unanswered.
   Those responsible must be held accountable. We consider the use of
   chemical weapons as a threat to international peace and security," NATO
   said in a statement. Some Syrians have told CNN they doubt their
   government used chemical weapons.

   'Not warmongers'

   Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations Bashar Jaafari lashed out
   Wednesday at the warnings and threats.

   "We are not warmongers. We are a peaceful nation seeking stability in
   the area because instability would serve the Israeli interests," he
   told reporters at the U.N. headquarters in New York.

   "We are in a state of war," and preparing for the possibility of such a
   scenario, he said. "The Syrian government is looking for stability."

   Jaafari accused rebels of obtaining material to produce chemical
   weapons "from outside powers -- mainly speaking, Turkey, Saudi Arabia
   and Qatar."

   [42]Intervening in Middle East turmoil: Mission impossible?

   In a letter to the United Nations, Syria asked for the U.N. weapons
   inspectors to stay in the country beyond their weekend deadline,
   Jaafari said.

   U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon did not address the letter directly
   but seemed to ask for a reprieve Wednesday for the sake of the
   inspectors. "The team needs time to do its job," he said from The
   Hague, where he visited the International Criminal Court.

   He said the inspectors had already collected valuable evidence.

   'Groundless excuses'

   Russia, a close ally of Syria, is expected to use its veto power to
   block a resolution, setting up a possible diplomatic showdown.

   Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insists there is no proof yet Syria's
   government is behind the chemical weapons attack.

   The ministry accused Washington of trying to "create artificial
   groundless excuses for military intervention."

   "The West handles the Islamic world the way a monkey handles a
   grenade," Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted.

   [43]Missile strikes on Syria likely response to chemical attack

   China, which also has a permanent seat on the council, would also
   probably object to military measures.

   "It's time that the United Nations Security Council shouldered its
   responsibilities on Syria, which for the past two and a half years it's
   failed to do," British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday.

   He added that even if China and Russia veto a resolution, "We and other
   nations still have a responsibility" to act.

   Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, meanwhile, warned of
   "graver conditions" if strikes are carried out against Syria.

   "If any country attacks another when it wants, that is like the Middle
   Ages," he said.

   [44]Who wants what after chemical weapons horror

   [45]Syria: Chemical weapons -- how did we get here?

   U.S. ruled out ground troops

   For almost two years, Obama has avoided direct military involvement in
   Syria's bloody civil war as the death toll skyrocketed to more than
   100,000, according to U.N. estimates.

   But Obama had warned that a chemical attack would cross a "red line."

   The White House previously ruled out sending ground troops to Syria or
   implementing a no-fly zone to blunt al-Assad's aerial superiority over
   rebels.

   [46]Syria strikes could worsen war, analysts say

   Brahimi said international law requires that that the Security Council
   approve military action.

   "I do know that President Obama and the American administration are not
   known to be trigger-happy," he said. "What they will decide I don't
   know."

   Outside of the United Nations, a military coalition is taking shape
   among Western powers.

   France has also signaled it would join Western military intervention
   against forces supporting al-Assad.

   President Francois Hollande said France is "ready to punish those who
   made the decision to gas these innocent people."

   The French Parliament will hold a session next week to debate the
   situation in Syria.

   German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David
   Cameron spoke by telephone Wednesday about the crisis.

   "Both agreed that comprehensive use of poisoned gas against the Syrian
   civil population has now been proven sufficiently and that the Syrian
   regime has these corresponding poisons, the know-how for their use and
   the carriers to deploy them," according to a statement released by
   German spokesman Steffen Seibert.

   "Both agreed this is a break in the already long ongoing internal
   conflict and that it cannot continue unpunished therefore an
   international reaction is inevitable. Both hope no member of the
   Security Council will close their eyes to this crime against humanity
   and that the corresponding consequences will be decided."

   Britain's Parliament, meanwhile, is voting on a motion Thursday that
   would rule out any consideration of possible military action until the
   United Nations chemical weapons inspectors explain their findings to
   the U.N. Security Council.

   After the inspectors have made their findings, members of Parliament
   would be required to take another vote, according to the motion being
   put forward.

   Meanwhile, Iran is sending a delegation to Syria on Saturday to "study
   the latest developments," the semi-official Fars News Agency reported
   Wednesday, citing a senior parliamentary lawmaker.

   The visit will examine "Syria's conditions and showing support for the
   Syrian government and nation after the recent US threats," Seyed
   Hossein Naqavi Hosseini, parliament's national security and foreign
   policy commissioner, told the news agency.
