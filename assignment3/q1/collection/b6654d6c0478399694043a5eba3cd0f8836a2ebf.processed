[24]Jeff Flake: I'm probably 'somewhere just below pond scum'

   Frog in pond scum
   Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)
   It's great to see Jeff Flake following the old folk wisdom with such
   devotion--you know, the maxim that says, "When you find yourself in a
   deep hole, keep shooting yourself in the foot repeatedly." On Monday,
   after a new PPP poll determined that Flake was [30]the most unpopular
   sitting senator in the country following his vote against expanding
   background checks for gun buyers, [31]he whiffed badly in trying to
   undermine the pollster's credibility. The problem? PPP's polling had
   been favorable to him throughout his 2012 election campaign. Oops.

   Now, instead of just shutting up and trying to move on, he's gone ahead
   and taken a page from the annoying right-wing uncle playbook and
   [32]posted about it on Facebook. Watch Flake try to be all cutely
   self-deprecating:

     Nothing like waking up to a poll saying you're the nation's least
     popular senator. Given the public's dim view of Congress in general,
     that probably puts me somewhere just below pond scum.

     Now, notwithstanding the polling firm's leftist bent, I would assume
     that my poll numbers have indeed taken a southerly turn since my
     vote against the Manchin-Toomey background check proposal. It was a
     popular amendment, and I voted against it.

   Hey, if Flake wants to confirm both that he's unpopular and that
   Manchin-Toomey is popular, I've got no problem with that. But just a
   day ago, PPP was full of it, according to the very same dude. This
   actually reflects a serious issue that Republicans frequently have with
   Public Policy Polling: They love to deride it as a "Democrat" firm, but
   all too often, they find themselves citing PPP's numbers whenever
   they're favorable to them. And since PPP is an honest broker, that
   happens a lot.

   (By the way, Flake wrote all this as a lead-in to linking this
   [33]dull, pedestrian op-ed defending Flake's vote because he "made a
   judgment call, knowing full well that it would tick off both sides."
   Bqhatevwr.)

   So Flake brought this all upon himself by attacking PPP's bona
   fides--though major props to Tom Jensen, for giving Flake a
   [34]well-deserved purple nurple. But in the end, nothing changes the
   fact that Flake has [35]made himself badly unpopular with his vote
   against background checks, and he's compounded his problem by
   continuing to call attention to it. Six more years of this and Arizona
   might just find itself with a new senator.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [54]Tagging tips - [55]Search For Tags - [56]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Keep in mind that most people view themselves in a more favorable
       light than do others.
       So, when Flake says he is pond scum he is probably a bit
       optimistic.

       been posting comments on his facebook page calling him a puke and a

   with Arizonans because he voted against background checks.  In the
   weeks leading up to the vote, he was being hammered by the right for
   his previous suggestion that he might be in favor of expanding
   background checks.  The local hate radio station here in Tucson was
   referring to him as a "gun grabber" and associating him with Nancy
   Pelosi.  I think it's entirely possible that his drop in poll numbers
   is due to a collapse in support from Republicans who believe he's some
   kind of Marxist.

   What an appropriate name.  Flake gives former Virginia senator William

   Scott held a press conference to deny that he was the dumbest man in
