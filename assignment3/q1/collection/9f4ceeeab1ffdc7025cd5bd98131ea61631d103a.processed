   Groundswell!
     * [29]This makes me smile:

     PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Plagued by infighting and deep ideological
     divisions, state Republican parties from Alaska to Maine are mired
     in dysfunction. Several state Republican leaders have been forced
     out or resigned in recent months, and many state GOP organizations
     face financial problems and skeptical national leaders.

     Democrats are not immune to such problems, but the conflicts on the
     Republican side highlight the tug of war over the GOP's future as
     national leaders work to improve the party's brand. At the same
     time, the Republican dysfunction raises questions about the GOP's
     ability to coordinate political activities in battleground states
     ahead of next year's midterm congressional elections.
     "There's been a lot of division and disharmony in the Republican
     Party," newly elected Maine GOP Chairman Rick Bennett told The
     Associated Press.
       Thanks, tea party. You guys have been awesome.
     * Kenneth Quinnell at the AFL-CIO [30]blog tells you something about
       Goldman Sachs that you didn't know. They're making your beer more
       expensive!

     Goldman Sachs bought up a number of warehouses near Detroit three
     years ago and started paying traders more to store aluminum in their
     warehouses. Goldman then charges the beer and soda companies (and
     other users of the metal) rent as the metal stays in the warehouses.
     A surplus of aluminum in the warehouses means the metal stays longer
     and Goldman can charge more rent. The beer companies then pass on
     the increased premium to consumers, making end prices rise. Even if
     companies bypass the warehouses, the market price for aluminum has
     already been increased by Goldman's manipulation of the market.
       We need more of this: taking a complex issue about banking
       regulations and putting it in terms everyone can understand.
     * The conservative movement's last-gasp effort to kill the Affordable
       Care Act? [31]Convince people not to take advantage of it:

     FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity, a conservative issue
     group financed by billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, known
     for funding conservative causes, are planning separate media and
     grassroots campaigns aimed at adults in their 20s and 30s - the very
     people Obama needs to have sign up for healthcare coverage in new
     online insurance exchanges if his reforms are to succeed.

     "We're trying to make it socially acceptable to skip the exchange,"
     said Dean Clancy, vice president for public policy at FreedomWorks,
     which boasts 6 million supporters. The group is designing a symbolic
     "Obamacare card" that college students can burn during campus
     protests.
       The success of the system, of course, depends on having younger
       people sign up for the program. So Republicans are trying to
       specifically reach young people trying to convince them not to,
       just to make sure the system doesn't work. And why?

     Political analysts say the Republican onslaught could prove
     short-lived. Beginning on October 1, Obama's health reform will help
     millions of uninsured people buy subsidized health insurance for the
     first time. Should enough people sign up by the time enrollment ends
     in March, the law's value as an election issue may run dry.

     "The fear is that the law will start to work and people will like
     it. They'll like having insurance, a safety net if you lose your
     job. Then Republicans are stuck with it," Ornstein said.
       So basically, yes. The Republican Party, the party that styles
       itself as the party of personal responsibility, is going to
       encourage young people to go uninsured, just to make sure Obama
       fails. There you go.
     * Love spiders like I do? Then good news: they [32]help the carbon
       cycle!

     The researchers manipulated the food chains of grassland ecosystem
     to see how the levels of carbon would change over time. Dr. Schmitz
     and his team created several controlled ecosystems: some that
     contained only native grasses and herbs, others that had plants and
     an herbivore grasshopper, and some others that had plants and
     herbivores along with a carnivore spider species -- all three tiers
     of the food chain. In addition, a form of traceable carbon dioxide
     was injected into sample cages covered with Plexiglas, which allowed
     the team to track the carbon levels by periodically taking leaf,
     root, and dead animal samples.

     The study found that the presence of spiders drove up the rate of
     carbon uptake by the plants by about 1.4 times more than when just
     grasshoppers were present and by 1.2 more times than when no animals
     were present.
       See? Spiders don't just take care of household pests--they help
       stop global warming in the process. They deserve your love.
     * Roughly a third of the Democratic Caucus in the Senate has
       [33]written a letter urging President Obama to appoint Janet Yellen
       to chair the Federal Reserve, instead of presumed first choice
       Larry Summers:

     Our nation badly needs a Chairman with a solid record as a bank
     regulator. Governor Yellen, as the President of the Federal Reserve
     Bank of San Francisco, identified the impending threats that both
     the housing bubble and the shadow banking sector posed to our entire
     economy. This prescience speaks to her independence, intellectual
     rigor and willingness to challenge conventional wisdom regarding
     deregulation -- essential traits for a successful Fed Chairman.
       Per Greg Sargent, the White House views the letter as
       "unproductive." I guess they've taken that whole "advice and
       consent of the Senate" thing out of the equation, and will just
       take "consent" from now on.
     * Justice Ginsburg, commenting on the [34]spate of voter suppression
       laws being passed in the wake of the SCOTUS decision that gutted a
       key component of the Voting Rights Act:

     "I didn't want to be right," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says about
     her prediction that striking a key prong of the Voting Rights Act
     will lead to a wave of minority voter suppression, "but sadly I am."
       Of course she was right! This wasn't a bug, it was a feature.
     * Hope Santa has some scuba gear, because right now, the North Pole
       is [35]kind of a lake. But don't worry, climate deniers. Nothing to
       see here. Move along.
     * [36]This headline defies categorization.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     The nonprofit organization, founded by former staffers for House
     Majority Leader Eric Cantor, will air its first anti-"Obamacare"
     spot during NBC's "Saturday Night Live," the strategists said.

     The commercial features actors, cast as advertising agents, scheming
     ineptly about how they can market the health care law - an allusion
     to how both executive agencies and the group Organizing for Action
     are hoping to promote the ACA over the summer.

     After the opposing YG Network ad debuts on "SNL," the same spot will
     appear Sunday on "Meet the Press," and on targeted primetime
     programs such as "Under the Dome," "America's Got Talent,
     "Mistresses" and "The Bachelorette."

 ACA needs 2.7 million 18-35 year olds ([383]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [384]nellgwen, [385]commonmass, [386]high uintas

   to stabilize prices in the insurance marketplaces according to
   [387]this post:

     One figure that's been bandied about is 2.7 million--the alleged
     magic number of 18-35 year olds required to keep premiums stable in
     the new marketplaces (the new term for "exchanges"). That number
     comes from the White House, though I'm not sure how they arrived at
     it or how important it really is. But let's accept it for the sake
     of argument. Is it a reasonable goal?

     It's worth understanding how the target population--young adults who
     are uninsured or currently have nongroup insurance--breaks down.
     About 25 million people between the ages of 18 and 35 match that
     description, stratified below along age and income bands important
     to the health law.

     ...

     f we look at just the predicted marketplace target
     population--setting aside those who will receive coverage under the
     Medicaid expansion and those below the poverty line in nonexpansion
     states--we're left with approximately 11 million adults between the
     ages of 18 and 35. The White House target is about a quarter of
     that, though this doesn't account for dependent coverage (about 4
     million are under 26) or take-up of catastrophic plans.* Even so,
     this strikes me as achievable, especially since their incomes are
     predominantly below 300% FPL, meaning most will receive subsidies to
     offset the cost of premiums.

       Inbev, in the US selling mostly Bud, has a huge variation in their
       pricing strategy.  A unit might cost a few to several cents to
       make, package, and ship, and it is sold for around a dollar.  This
       highly inflated price is due to the consolidation of the industry.
        This is why the Corona deal was such a concern, even though it is
       not a huge player.  It would allow the mass market beer makers to
       raise prices.
       Here is the deal.  It is just like Walmart, except acting as a
       cartel.  If anyone starts a pricing war over beer, Inbev has the
       ability to lower the price even more and put the competitor out of
       business.  This is what some think Walmart did back in the 90's.
       Everyone know this, so beer prices stay generally high.
       This is not all bad.  The inflated price of mass produced beer has
       allow smaller companies to exist as they can sell at $1+ prices and
       still be competitive.  Such beer is generally sold in bottles, so
       it is not effected by the aluminum situation
       In any case, aluminum costs should only effect the consumer if the
       beer companies want it to.  Otherwise they can eat the extra cost.
