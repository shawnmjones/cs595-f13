[69]Report shows lavish spending at IRS conference

   Posted by
   [70]CNN's Dana Bash and Ashley Killough

   Updated 3:44 p.m. ET Tuesday 6/4

   (CNN) - The Internal Revenue Service spent millions of taxpayer dollars
   on everything from event planners' commissions to speakers' fees to
   guest prizes to parody videos at a 2010 conference, an audit of the
   agency shows.

   The beleaguered agency - already snared in controversy over its
   targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status - spent $4.1
   million on a 2010 conference in Anaheim, California, with "questionable
   expenses" comprising much of the budget, according to [71]the report
   released Tuesday by the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax
   administration.
   The audit notes that a large chunk of that money - about $3.2 million -
   came from unused funds allocated for hiring. This was in the same year
   that the IRS began to single out conservative and tea party groups that
   sought tax-exempt office, in part because the agency said it did not
   have the personnel to handle the overwhelming amount of applications
   pouring in that year.

   "Effective cost management is especially important given the current
   economic environment and focus on Government efficiency," Inspector
   General J. Russell George said in a statement. "Certain of the IRS's
   expenses associated with the Anaheim conference do not appear to be a
   good use of taxpayer funds."

   [72]Read the audit report

   The August 2010 conference, held by the Small Business/Self-Employed
   division, had 2,600 attendees at three hotels in Anaheim. The audit
   states that none of the guests were required to document their
   attendance at the training sessions.

   While the division made 1,516 hires that year, not all of them were on
   board the full year, so the division used the unused money for the
   three-day conference. Managers also indicated the used additional
   training funds for the event.

   The audit notes that the IRS-a stickler for record keeping-could only
   provide documentation for $4.1 million. The division estimated it
   actually spent $4,297,285, but could not source that additional amount,
   according to the report.

   The IRS used event planners instead of IRS employees or contractors to
   set up the conference, giving no incentive to get lower rates and
   leaving the government to pay $135 per night for all rooms. Instead of
   working for favorable room rates, both event planners got $66,500 in
   commission from the hotels, according to the audit.

   Other expenses included more than $135,000 on outside
   speakers-including a $17,000 fee for a speaker who created paintings on
   stage to make his point that one must free "the thought process to find
   creative solutions to challenges."

   "The speaker created six paintings at these two keynote sessions (three
   at each session). These paintings consisted of the following portraits:
   Albert Einstein (one); Michael Jordan (one); Abraham Lincoln (one); U2
   singer Bono (one); and the Statute of Liberty (two)," the audit states.

   While two of the paintings were given away at the conference and three
   were donated, one was reported lost.

   The IRS also paid $11,400 to a speaker who specializes in happiness and
   positive psychology. He led four 90-minute workshops.

   Another speaker received $27,500 for two hour-long speeches. The
   speaker's fee included a $2,500 flight in first class.

   The presentation was based on the speaker's published book and,
   according to the contract, the speaker was to "share how seemingly
   random combinations of ideas can drive radical innovations."

   On a somewhat ironic note, one of the sessions in the programs lists a
   speech given by IRS speakers titled: "Political Savvy: How Not to Shoot
   Yourself in the Foot."

   In other expenses, IRS employees doled out $35,800 on three planning
   trips before the conference.

   Forty-five employees who lived in the local area got to stay in the
   hotels and received daily per diems, amounting to more than $30,000
   total.

   And attendees got numerous gifts and promotional items from conference
   organizers-totaling more than $64,000. This included imprinted bags,
   imprinted hard-covered journals, lanyards, travel mugs, picture frames,
   and various promotion items, according to the audit.

   Some attendees were also given Los Angeles Angels baseball tickets as
   contest prizes, which the division said came as a donation from the
   hotels.

   At the three hotels, 132 suite upgrades were provided each night of the
   conference, representing nearly 5% of the 2,830 rooms booked. The
   upgrades ranged from $299 to $1,000 per night.

   The hotels provided 10 free rooms each night, which were used by paid
   speakers and non-IRS support staff, according to the audit. Two of the
   event planners were given free rooms for 19 nights.

   While attendees received a daily $71 per diem, they were also given two
   free drink coupons, daily continental breakfasts, and beverages and
   snacks during breaks.

   The SB/SE division spent more than $50,000 on videos for the
   conference. One of the videos, CNN has reported, had a Star-Trek theme,
   while the other was a parody on IRS employees learning how to do the
   Cupid Shuffle dance.

   Because the IRS did not keep track of all expenses for the videos, the
   inspector general's office estimates that it took 62 staff hours to
   produce the piece at a minimum hourly rate of $50.

   While the focus of the audit was on the 2010 conference, the inspector
   general looked at all IRS conferences between 2010 and 2012, finding
   that the agency held 225 conferences during that time at an estimated
   cost of $49 million. Nearly $38 million of that came in 2010 alone.

   The inspector general's office said it made nine recommendations to the
   IRS for future conferences, and the agency agreed to all nine.

   Responding to the report, the IRS maintained that the 2010 conference
   was needed to make sure managers had proper training for "significant
   new programs, major staff and manager turnover and a substantial
   increase in security threats."

   The Small Business/Self-Employed division amounts to nearly one-third
   of the agency's total work force, and at the time of the 2010
   conference, almost 30% of the division's managers had been hired in the
   prior two years.

   However, acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel, who was appointed last
   month after his predecessor stepped down amid scandal, said in a
   statement that the 2010 conference was an "unfortunate vestige from a
   prior era" and such a conference would not take place today.

   "I will continue my efforts and ensure tight spending protocols are in
   place to protect the use of taxpayer dollars," he said.

   According to the official IRS response, written by IRS chief financial
   officer Pamela LaRue, the agency had already put in place an "extensive
   series of procedures" and has "dramatically cut" expenses for
   conferences since 2010. For example, LaRue notes, all conferences must
   now be approved centrally rather than by individual units at the IRS.

   The number of large meetings decreased by 84% and the costs for those
   meetings decreased by 87% by 2012, LaRue writes. The IRS predicts costs
   for 2013 will be even lower.

   Travel and training expenses are also down by more than 80%, according
   to the IRS. The agency now does 90% of its training hours online-nearly
   double the amount from 2010.

   "The IRS takes seriously our obligations to be good stewards of
   government resources," LaRue writes, adding that the agency has reached
   $1 billion in savings since 2009.

   As for the use of event planners and the receipt of room upgrades noted
   in the audit, LaRue says those items did not involve "any additional
   government resources."

   IRS officials will continue to make their case this week when they
   appear Thursday before the House Oversight and Government Reform.

       Oh boy. When it rains, it pours. If they didn't bring attention to
       themselves, they'd be having a lavish banquet right now. Luckily in
       a few weeks this will all die down and they can go back to business
       as usual. No worries.

       Less than the $2 trillion tax breaks GWB gave to millionaires and
       billionaires while they layoff millions of Americans and then
       turned around and partied at the Hamptons, the French Riviera and
       Monte Carlo.

       El Jefe if you pay taxes 500 a day should sound outrageous for a
       department of the goverment which is essentially a collection
       agency hooting and yuking it up at our expense. This is our money
       not the governments. Every dime should be scrutinized. The IRS not
       being able to account for every dime is an example of us working
       for the government instead of the goverment working for us.

       This is a perfect storm of an arrogant government agency and an
       incompetent, out of touch Congress. The House Committee on
       Oversight is just now figuring out there is a problem with the IRS?
       How clueless can they be? And it's only because some of their
       buddies couldn't get their tax exempt status? The IRS has been
       harassing middle income tax payers for years and Congress has
       turned a blind eye - shows how little our "leaders" care about the
       citizens who actually pay their salaries.

       It's too easy to spend other people's money. The public has been
       abused. The media needs to keep digging.

       This government as a wholr has lost it's moral compass. It has
       abandoned its duties in order to pursue the interests of the
       individual politician and or bureaucrat.
       As a country we must stand together and demand change. If a
       majority refused to fund this government we would see change over
       night.

       wasted on two illegitimate wars.

       The ignorance of the average American blogging here is astounding.
       These conferences have been a staple of American business for close
       to 100 years.
       And yes ... there is something called 'meal money', and yes,
       sometimes they give out '2 free drinks'.
       My my ... wait until these bloggers find out that CEO's fly every
       day to different cities for 1 hour meetins, typically costing over
       $50,000. 'Companies are different'? No - we all pay them just like
       we pay the IRS, and the FDA, and the EPA, and the Patriot Act staff
       .... etc...

       Actually the costs per employee are not any different than any
       other big business off site developmental conference.
       And if you look, their expenditures had also been declining from
       there. The IRS is just a massive organization..who had a hiring
       freeze on since the economic collapse of '08.
