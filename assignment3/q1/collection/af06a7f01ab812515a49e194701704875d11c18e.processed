Republicans Win Congress as Democrats Get Most Votes

   By Greg Giroux - 2013-03-19T00:00:00Z

   In the 1780s, [57]Patrick Henry tried to shape Virginia's House
   district lines to block [58]James Madison from serving in the first
   [59]U.S. Congress.

   The grudge between the two men: Henry opposed the U.S. Constitution
   freshly written primarily by Madison. The gambit failed and Madison won
   his seat.

   More than two centuries later, the politics of redistricting still are
   [60]shaping Congress.

   A majority of Americans [61]disapprove of the Republicans in Congress,
   yet the odds remain in the party's favor that it will retain control of
   the House. One big reason the Republicans have this edge: their
   district boundaries are drawn so carefully that the only votes that
   often matter come from fellow Republicans.

   GRAPHIC: [62]2010 Gains Give Republicans Redistricting Edge

   The 2010 elections, in which Republicans won the House majority and
   gained more than 700 state legislative [63]seats across the nation,
   gave the party the upper-hand in the process of redistricting, the
   once-a-decade redrawing of congressional seats. The advantage helped
   them design safer partisan districts and maintain their House majority
   in 2012 -- even as they lost the presidential race by about 5 million
   votes. Also nationwide, Democratic House candidates combined to win
   about 1.4 million more votes than Republicans, according to data
   compiled by [64]Bloomberg News.

   "The Republican-created maps in most states set up a sort of seawall,"
   said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
   "As the decade goes on, people do shift party allegiances and move in
   and out of town, and so the effects erode a little bit, but it's still
   a seawall and it's still keeping some of the flood of 2010 in," Levitt
   said.

Thwarting Obama

   The election results mean [65]House Republicans will have the power to
   block or demand amendments to President [66]Barack Obama's agenda.

     * PART 3: [69]California Nonpolitical Districting Ousts Life
       Incumbents

   That tension will be on display during the [70]deficit reduction talks
   in coming months as Obama advocates a combination of spending cuts and
   new revenues. That position was favored by 67 percent of Americans in a
   CNN/Orc International poll conducted Nov. 16, two weeks after voters
   re-elected Obama. Republican House members last week unveiled a budget
   that would eliminate the deficit in 10 years by cutting $4.6 trillion
   and using no new [71]tax revenue.

   It's a predicament presidents previously have faced. Before Obama, five
   of the last six elected presidents --Democrats and Republicans -- had a
   House controlled by the opposition party at some point during their
   tenure. President [72]Jimmy Carter was the one who didn't.

Rare Outcome

   Still, it's rare for one party to win more House seats while securing
   fewer votes than the other party. The last time it happened before 2012
   was in 1996, when Democrats won the nationwide House vote by 43.6
   million to 43.4 million as Republicans held their majority and [73]Bill
   Clinton was re-elected president, according to the U.S. House Clerk's
   office.

   Redistricting is intended to ensure House members represent roughly
   equal size populations. Yet from the first Congress, party leaders
   began exploiting the map-making exercise by weakening the voting
   strength of some groups to gain partisan advantage, a practice known as
   gerrymandering.

   Democrats aren't immune from engaging in the political bloodsport of
   redistricting. With control of the process in [74]Illinois, Democratic
   lawmakers from Obama's home state approved a map on Memorial Day
   weekend in 2011 that led to the defeat of five Republicans in the 2012
   elections.

State Legislatures

   In most cases, state legislatures are charged with overseeing the
   redistricting process, which is done to reflect demographic shifts
   recorded in the census. The 435 U.S. House [75]districts boundaries are
   adjusted based on population migration during the past decade.

   Republican-controlled statehouses dominated redistricting that occurred
   after 2010 through a combination of planning and good fortune.

   The party began preparing two years in advance of the 2010 elections by
   concentrating on candidate recruitment and fundraising. The Republican
   State Leadership Committee, which focuses on state legislative races,
   called its effort the Redistricting Majority Project, or REDMAP.

   In the 2010 campaign, the [76]Republican Governors Association outspent
   the Democratic Governors Association, $132 million to $65 million,
   according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based
   research group that tracks campaign giving. The Republican State
   Leadership Committee outspent the Democratic Legislative Campaign
   Committee, $21 million to $5 million.

Wave Election

   Democrats also faced a political environment that had swung sharply
   Republican, partly due to a wave of public discontent over passage of
   Obama's health-care law.

   The same Republican surge that helped the party net more than 60 seats
   in the U.S. House -- the biggest gains by any party in 62 years --
   swept in governors and state legislators.

   "2010 was a really difficult year for there to be a Republican wave
   election," said Michael Sargeant, the DLCC's executive director.

   The spending and timing paid off for the Republicans, as they won
   control of 57 [77]legislative chambers, up from 36 before the 2010
   elections, and increased their governorships to 29 from 23, according
   to the [78]National Conference of State Legislatures. In the wake of
   the 2012 elections, Republicans control 56 state legislative chambers
   and 30 governorships.

Impact Election

   "You can spend hundreds of millions of dollars fighting over a couple
   dozen congressional districts over 10 years, or you can spend
   significantly less and impact the shape of those congressional
   elections over 10 years via state legislative elections," said Chris
   Jankowski, the president of the Washington-based RSLC, referring to the
   Republican strategy heading into the 2010 vote. "It was a
   cost-effective analysis that truly bore out in reality."

   Once in office, technology made it easier for line-drawers to
   consolidate and further their partisan goals.

   Map-making software is cheaper, more powerful and widely available,
   compared to a decade ago. State lawmakers can build databases with
   detailed voter registration figures, election results and population
   data to project campaign outcomes and demographic trends.

   It may also be easier to predict voter preferences. Party- line voting
   is increasing: fewer than 30 districts backed the presidential
   candidate of one party and a House candidate of the opposite party in
   2012, the lowest total in at least 90 years, according to data compiled
   by Bloomberg.

Map-Makers Gold

   "If you're a map-maker drawing lines, that's just gold for you, because
   you can very reliably use partisan voting patterns in one election to
   predict what it might be in another, or much more so than you could
   before," said Rob Richie, the executive director of FairVote, a Takoma
   Park, Maryland-based nonprofit that wants to change the redistricting
   process to reduce partisanship in [79]Washington.

   The 2012 results show how Republicans gerrymandered congressional lines
   to produce favorable outcomes even in states that lean Democratic.

   In [80]Michigan, Ohio and [81]Pennsylvania, the clustering of Democrats
   in metropolitan areas made it easy for Republican line-drawers to pack
   them into a few districts while giving their own party more modest --
   yet consistent -- advantages in the remaining ones.

North Carolina

   In Pennsylvania, where Democratic votes are concentrated in
   Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Republicans won 13 of 18 House seats while
   losing the statewide congressional vote, 2.8 million to 2.7 million. In
   [82]North Carolina, Republicans drew three districts to be
   overwhelmingly Democratic and won nine of the other ten, even as House
   Democratic candidates won the statewide vote, 2.2 million to 2.1
   million.

   While drawing federal districts to their advantage, Republicans also
   created favorable state House maps to make it harder for Democrats to
   wrest control of the redistricting process in 2020. In Michigan,
   Republican candidates won most of the 110 state House seats despite
   winning 350,000 fewer votes than Democrats, said Sargeant.

   "Clearly, the Republican gerrymander had a lot to do with it," he said.

   Politics and redistricting have been intertwined since the nation's
   earliest days, as shown by the Henry-Madison feud outlined in a 2010
   report by the Brennan Center for Justice at [83]New York University
   School of Law.

`Gerrymandering' Origins

   The practice of drawing party-friendly districts was given its common
   nickname -- gerrymandering -- in 1812. That's when Massachusetts
   Governor Elbridge Gerry signed a bill that redrew state senate
   districts unfavorable to his rivals, the Federalists. The shape of one
   district was said to resemble a salamander.

   One of the most notable partisan battles over redistricting occurred in
   [84]Texas in 2003, when Tom DeLay, then the U.S. House majority leader,
   engineered a rare mid-decade remap that so angered Democratic state
   legislators that most of them fled to Ardmore, Oklahoma, and
   [85]Albuquerque, [86]New Mexico, to prevent a quorum needed to pass the
   plan.

   The House ethics committee admonished DeLay for his role in using the
   [87]Federal Aviation Administration to obtain information on the
   whereabouts of absent Texas legislators. The rebuke one month before
   the 2004 election didn't stop Republicans from gaining five House seats
   in Texas, offsetting a two-seat loss outside of the state and helping
   the party hold its chamber majority.

Democratic Gains

   The U.S. Supreme Court invalidated part of the Texas map in 2006 and a
   federal court redrew it before that year's midterm elections. Democrats
   then won two Texas seats from Republicans - - including the one DeLay
   had resigned from in mid-2006 -- and 30 nationwide to take control of
   the House.

   While redistricting usually is a once-per-decade exercise, the Texas
   fight shows that brawls can surface at unexpected times.

   In January, Republicans in the evenly divided Virginia Senate shoved
   through a new map on a party-line vote when a Democrat was absent to
   attend Obama's inauguration. The map was blocked by the Republican
   House speaker on a procedural point.

   "Virginia pointed out once again that the players who are involved in
   the process will try to game the system however they can, be they
   Republicans or Democrats," said Kim Brace, the president of Election
   Data Services Inc., a political consulting firm in Manassas, Virginia.
