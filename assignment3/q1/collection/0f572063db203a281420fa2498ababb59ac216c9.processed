[22]Abbreviated pundit-round-up: 'Poor people's justice is to justice as
monkey business is to business'

   [29]Leonard Pitts Jr. at The Miami Herald deplores a continuing
   injustice in Right to counsel? It's stacked against the poor. The
   Supreme Court's unanimous landmark ruling a half-century ago in Gideon
   v. Wainwright declared that, no matter what the charge, everyone has a
   right to legal counsel, appointed by the court and paid for by the
   state in cases when the defendant cannot afford one:

     It turns out there is a gulf between the 1963 promise and the 2013
     reality. It turns out one lawyer can be expected to try 400, 500,
     600 cases a year. It turns out public defenders are so underfunded
     and overwhelmed it is not uncommon for a defendant to meet his
     attorney for the first time in court. It turns out the situation is
     so dire that in at least one jurisdiction a judge pressed tax
     attorneys and property lawyers into service in criminal court. It
     turns out poor people's justice is to justice as monkey business is
     to business.

     Ask Clarence Jones, who spent over a year in prison just waiting for
     an attorney -- and was still there as the book went to press -- on a
     charge of burglary.

   [30]Paul Butler at The New York Times takes a similar tack in Gideon's
   Muted Trumpet:

     A poor person has a much greater chance of being incarcerated now
     than when Gideon was decided, 50 years ago today. This is not
     because of increased criminality -- violent crime has plunged from
     its peak in the early 1990s -- but because of prosecutorial policies
     that essentially target the poor and relegate their lawyers to
     negotiating guilty pleas, rather than mounting a defense.

   [31]Stephen B. Bright and Sia Sanneh at the Los Angeles Times do
   likewise in Violating the right to a lawyer:

     Guilty pleas account for about 95% of all criminal convictions. In
     many courts, poor people are processed through the courts without
     lawyers or moments after speaking for a few minutes with lawyers
     they just met and will never see again. This is called "meet 'em and
     plead 'em" or "McJustice."

   More punditry can be found below the fold.

   [32]Paul Krugman at The New York Times busts some people who seriously
   need to be busted in Marches of Folly:

     The really striking thing, during the run-up to the war, was the
     illusion of consensus. To this day, pundits who got it wrong excuse
     themselves on the grounds that "everyone" thought that there was a
     solid case for war. Of course, they acknowledge, there were war
     opponents -- but they were out of the mainstream.

     The trouble with this argument is that it was and is circular:
     support for the war became part of the definition of what it meant
     to hold a mainstream opinion. Anyone who dissented, no matter how
     qualified, was ipso facto labeled as unworthy of consideration.

   [33]Doyle McManus at the Los Angeles Times answers his own question in
   the Iraq war: Lessons learned? with a don't count on it:

     The debate over what went wrong -- which is also a debate over who
     deserves blame -- is still under way. Was it bad intelligence? Bad
     policymaking? A spineless Congress? Insufficiently skeptical media?
     Or, most likely, all of the above?

     But the more important question for the future is this: Have we
     learned enough from the experience to make a difference the next
     time? It would be nice if the question were hypothetical, but it's
     not. The U.S. conflict with Iran is different from the confrontation
     with Iraq in many ways, but it's the same intelligence services
     gathering information and the same political system that will make
     the calls.

   [34]Joel Bleifuss at In These Times writes Tea Party Coup D'état:

     Democratic political operatives believe Tea Party purges weaken the
     G.O.P.'s electoral prospects. They point to the hard-right
     congressional candidates who lost last November.

     But these liberal strategists fail to appreciate that the Tea
     Party's ideological discipline, nurtured by Republican incumbents'
     fear of being "primaried," has turned the Boehner House into a
     formidable and effective obstacle to Democratic initiatives.
     Republican intransigence may disaffect some voters, but it excites
     both the Tea Party faithful and the wingnut donor class.

   [35]Brent Budowsky at The Hill has some terrific advice for the Supreme
   Court's champion clown in Scalia: Recuse or Resign:

     Scalia's conduct destroys any appearance of impartiality or judicial
     temperament. He makes comments offensive to gays while gay rights
     are pending before the court. He makes racially insensitive comments
     about voting rights while voting rights are pending. He makes
     constitutionally ignorant comments about legislative intent.

     Scalia has a right to believe voting rights are a "perpetuation of
     racial entitlement" for blacks and Hispanics, but should promote
     this repellent and biased view on conservative talk radio, not the
     court. [...]

     Scalia should recuse himself from cases in which his appearance of
     impartiality is fatally compromised or he should resign from the
     court.

   [36]Bradley Burston Haaretz warns Obama visit marks a choice for
   Israel: Grow up or grow old:

     The silent killer, the serious, potentially fatal threat to the
     health and longevity of this aging Israel, is the idea that we can
     pay feeble lip service to the concept of two states, while fostering
     risk factors potentially lethal to a peaceful solution. We can tell
     ourselves that forgoing the idea of two states is the mature, the
     realistic, the truly Jewish thing to do.

     Or we can grow up.

   [37]Robert Dreyfuss at The Nation writes about Obama's Iran Missteps
   Before Israel Visit:

     Speaking to Israeli reporters, Obama broke little new ground in
     addressing the issue of Iran's nuclear program, but curiously--and
     widely trumpeted by both American and Israeli media covering his
     remarks--the president chose a weird formulation, namely, that Iran
     can make a bomb within one year. As quoted by CNN from Israel's
     Channel 2 TV, Obama said: "Right now, we think that it would take
     over a year or so for Iran to actually develop a nuclear weapon."

     According to some readings, Obama's statement was designed to
     mollify Israeli fears that Iran is getting close to a bomb. But
     really, the impact of the statement is the opposite, because a year
     seems like a pretty short time to most people. And, in reality, Iran
     has taken no steps toward any militarization of its nuclear
     research. Quite the opposite, Tehran has countered the overblown
     rhetoric of American and Israeli hawks by changing much of its 20
     percent-enriched uranium into fuel for its research reactor, in a
     manner that guarantees that it can't be easily converted into
     material for a weapon.

   [38]Heidi Moore at The Guardian writes The JP Morgan debacle was not a
   momentary lapse. It was an issue of culture:

     Dimon - and JP Morgan - have shown a lot of compunction. It's clear
     they are embarrassed by the London Whale debacle. But it is
     embarrassed for the wrong reasons. JP Morgan has indicated that it
     believes it got the facts wrong, that a group of people screwed up
     and those people are gone, and now the bank can go about its moral,
     principled way. The bank has repeatedly made it clear that a big
     loss - even of $6.2bn - cannot take down a bank with the size and
     strength of JP Morgan - a bank that has, in its own favorite phrase,
     "a fortress balance sheet".

     But this is not a math problem. This is an issue of culture. It's an
     issue of hubris, and lack of humility. What happened in the London
     Whale debacle was not an oversight of a single moment. It was days,
     weeks, and months of bad, entitled behavior.

   [39]Stanley Crouch at the New York Daily News writes Speaking truth to
   the big banks :

     [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren has not lost her form. She expresses her
     charismatic intelligence by castigating Democrats and Republicans
     alike for having let the robbers who run the banks get away with too
     much and grow more bloated in the process, like swollen serpents
     wrapped in silk pinstripes.

     To fully realize what might yet happen, we need to take the long
     view. The banks that were too big to fail in 2008 remain so because
     both parties have decided to keep it that way. Nothing has changed
     that -- neither the housing crash nor Occupy Wall Street.

   [40]E.J. Dionne at the Washington Post asks a serious question in
   Conservatives' contradictions on American power:

     Do conservatives still believe in American greatness? [...]

     And do conservatives who say they favor American greatness think
     they are strengthening our nation and its ability to shape events
     abroad with an ongoing budget stalemate created by their refusal to
     reach agreement with President Obama on a deal that combines
     spending cuts and new taxes? Would they rather waste the next three
     years than make any further concessions to a president the voters
     just reelected?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health

   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       one for the rich, and one for everyone else. Increasingly, crimes
       which make other people money are not treated as crimes (something
       I think Sen. Warren would like to correct).
       As for Scalia, he is no longer fit to sit on the bench. He should
       resign, or face impeachment. Of course, that would mean real
       "originalists" in the House would have to, you know, stick up for
       their constitutional theory. For which I won't hold my breath.

       be conscious, sober or competent, merely present.  Most
       jurisdictions I have seen have plea agreements in 75%-100% of
       cases.  As one guy explained to me why not to invoke your rights to
       an attorney: if you can horsetrade with the DA, you can talk down a
       felony to a misdemeanor or at least maybe probation whereby if you
       insist on an attorney, the cops slide your case to the back burner
       and if you insist on a trial, the DA slides your case to the
       backburner so you are able to spend less time in jail if you
       negotiate directly than if you go through PD dept or even if you go
       to trial and are found not guilty.

 All attorneys are not created equal ([153]8+ / 0-)

                [161]Calamity Jean

       Choosing to be represented by an attorney is not the same as
       requesting a defense by a public defender - all attorneys are not
       equal.  A defendant who can afford an attorney benefits
       significantly.  The Assistant District Attorney in this area is
       known informally as "Santa Claus" for the uncanny resemblance to
       the jolly old elf and to his generosity towards those represented
       by attorneys.  He prizes his high conviction rate, which means that
       every potentially contested case is plea bargained.  Felonies
       quickly become misdemeanors, and cases are routinely rescheduled
       until witnesses lose interest or miss a court date.  On the other
       hand, defendants without their own representation will face a very
       different environment.  It isn't the justice system they taught me
       about in civics class many years ago.

 Ct-Apptd Fee Structure is Huge Disincentive... ([185]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [186]Meteor Blades, [187]Amber6541

   ...for court-appointed lawyers in most criminal cases short of captial
   offenses to do more than the minimum investment necessary to work out a
   quick-and-dirty plea deal with the DA.  The court's presumptive fee
   schedule for private court-appointed lawyers in most felony and
   misdemeanor cases is capped at such a limited amount that it barely
   covers (at a heavily discounted fee rate) enough time for the attonrey
   to briefly interview the client, read the police report, and make a
   brief court appearance.  To be paid to put more time into the case than
   to quickly plead 'em out, the attorney often has to petition the
   presiding judge for additional allowance on the case, citing
   justificationhaving the state pay for the attorney to put enough time
   into it to effectively contest it (again at a discounted rate).  Of
   course, the usual solution is a public defender's office whose salary
   and overhead is set, but what happens there is the defender's office is
   overwhelmed with such a high volume of cases that they're forced too
   often into the same dynamic of not being able to afford to spend much
   time with most clients except to work out a quick n'dirty plea
   agreement.

   I will say, however that the reality is that 90-95% of criminal clients
   are in fact guilty, not necessarily of the full extent of what they are
   charged with, but the system is abysmally poorly set up to protect the
   other 5-10%.

   Funding defense attorneys is not in the interests of the prison
   industry.  From my recollection, the ABA leans left and we can't be
   spending taxpayer dollars on bleeding heart liberal lawyers when
   there's good 'ol American wingnut prison companies to throw a bone to
   as the treasury is looted on our way to a feudal society.

   Just wait until you see that system of justice!

       That we live in a country where banks and investment houses can
       knowingly defraud it's customers - so much so that it threatens the
       global economy - and those guys are untouchable.
       Meanwhile...
       Roughly 1.5 million are in jail presently over simple marijuana
       possession.
       Knowingly sell worthless financial products to millions of
       Americans for top dollar - even bragging about it like some sort of
       joke in company emails - caveat emplor - not a crime apparently.
       Have a few joints in your pocket - crime punishable by a year in
       jail.  Or worse, if you happen to be in your car while possessing
       said joints (car impounded, loose your license, etc...)
       Its a head-scratcher that's for certain.

     Iran Plans to Legalize Marijuana

     The Iranian government announced Thursday that it plans to legalize
     marijuana for both medical and personal use, according to state
     media.

     Iran's parliament approved a bill that would allow Iranian citizens
     to purchase up to 2 ounces of marijuana from private, state-licensed
     stores and cafés.

     The proposed law taxes marijuana up to 25 percent. Commercial
     marijuana growers would need to apply for a permit from the Iranian
     Ministry of Agriculture.

   Now we'll bomb them for sure.

          Opinion, [598]DvCM

   attorneys play and accept it as an important one. Even the most
   progressive among us, those who believe the State abuses it's power on
   a daily basis, are quick to vilify a defense attorney if that attorney
   is defending someone we've already decided is guilty of a horrible
   crime. Some of the ugliest threads on this progressive site begin with
   someone either defending an attorney who represents a "bad guy" or who
   is simply doing his/her job.  Or one that points out the rights of the
   accused.  Instead of falling for the state framing of sleazy lawyers
   using loopholes to set the guilty free we need to recognize that those
   "loopholes" are usually constitutional rights. We don't pay for
   indigent defense because we don't value legal defense except when we
   need it personally. And the rich are the only ones who can afford to
   wait until they need it to care about whether or not there is competent
   legal representation available.  A speaker at my law school graduation,
   many years ago when apartheid was at its peak, warned that the first
   thing that disappeared in a long line of human and civil rights to
   disappear in South Africa, was strong defense in criminal cases.  He
   pointed out that totalitarian regimes use the criminal courts to quash
   dissent. And if we've allowed criminal rights to be diminished to the
   point of uselessness because we didn't like the real criminals who
   avail themselves of those rights, we have a system set up which allows
   the state to persecute dissent very effectively.

       likely it is that anyone in the system will care if there is an
       unjust result.  So minorities get the double whammy of economics
       and racism. Which is exactly what the speaker at my graduation was
       pointing out. By the time he was speaking to us most white people
       in South Africa were also afraid of the Government and afraid to
       speak their minds. But because those white people let the unjust
       system formulate around poor blacks there were no protections for
       the white citizens by the time they realized they might want or
       need them.

   We're called into the court room. The judge gives us a run down of the
   case while the defendant was sitting in the room. He was accused of
   punching a woman and stealing her purse. Witnesses for the prosecution
   include the victim and two police officers. The guy's sitting there
   making sheepish eye contact with everyone.

   How do we not formulate opinions and ideas before the case even gets
   started? How is this justice?

 Even the Monterey Herald is writing about ([652]0+ / 0-)

   [653]Gideon's promise: 50 years after landmark case, public defenders
   worry about their future:

     California had the first public defender's office in the nation,
     opening in Los Angeles in 1914.
     ...
      Jeff Adachi of San Francisco, the only elected public defender in
     the state, says California has an uneven history when it comes to
     indigent defense.

     "It wasn't something that was common to most states until the Gideon
     decision," he said. "Gideon made it official, but they didn't say
     who was going to pay for it."

     Because of this funding uncertainty, he said, "you have an uneven
     patchwork quilt. Every county has its own system."

     Adachi said this patchwork also means some areas in California
     invest more in their defenders than others.

   It somehow figures that the economic terrorism being visited upon us by
   intransigent Republicans would inflict even more harm on the most
   vulnerable, including those who are accused of a crime but who can't
   afford a lawyer to defend them.
