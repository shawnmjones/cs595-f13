A Great Meeting on Polio with Afghanistan Officials

     Afghanistan faces real challenges in stopping polio. But after
     meeting with Afghani political and health leaders in Abu Dhabi, I'm
     optimistic they're on the right track and that we will see a
     polio-free Afghanistan.

   Stopping polio in Afghanistan is key to eradicating the disease
   worldwide. So I was grateful that Afghanistan officials came all the
   way to Abu Dhabi this week to meet with me in person. They briefed me
   on the steps they are taking to get the polio situation back on track.
   It was a very positive exchange.

   After a large outbreak in 2011, officials overseeing Afghanistan's
   polio program developed an emergency action plan. It includes increased
   oversight by political leaders, a range of innovative strategies, and
   stepped-up negotiations with all parties to ensure safe access to
   children for vaccination teams. Getting vaccinators into these conflict
   areas is critical to getting the job done.

   Last month President Karzai approved the emergency action plan and
   designated one of his advisors to be the focal point for polio. While
   he was in New York for the UN General Assembly meetings, he publicly
   reaffirmed his commitment to doing everything possible to end polio in
   Afghanistan.

   I am pleased to see that implementation of the emergency action plan
   has begun. It has the right ingredients and it was good to see that it
   also focuses on routine immunization--an important outcome of the work
   on polio.

   Intensified oversight of the plan will be the key to success. Health
   officials have highlighted 13 high-risk districts that are critical to
   eliminating remaining polio reservoirs. Access and security are some of
   the challenges in those districts. I'm pleased to see that Afghanistan
   has created permanent vaccination teams to get around security
   obstacles. The challenge is how to "depoliticize" polio eradication and
   bring all parties to the table around this important initiative.

   There's still plenty of work to do to stop polio in Afghanistan.
   However, I'm confident that with President Karzai's leadership and the
   creativity and energy of the team I got to meet, polio will be stopped
   forever. I look forward to celebrating a polio-free Afghanistan.

The MenAfriVac Vaccine: an Amazing Success Story in Global Health

   A decade ago, the foundation made a big bet--that we could help end
   meningitis A in Sub-Saharan Africa. There were plenty of skeptics, but
   today we are well on the way to achieving that goal.

The Majlis Lectures

   I participated this week in a Majlis, a kind of Arabic townhall, hosted
   by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince
   of Abu Dhabi.
