   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the report
     * Syrian TV reports Israel has targeted the Jamraya area
     * Al-Assad makes another public appearance
     * The United States "is appalled" by the reports

   (CNN) -- Syria accused Israel of firing rockets into the Damascus
   suburb of Jamraya on Sunday, striking a "scientific research center,"
   Syrian state TV reported.

   It is the second Syrian claim this year of a strike against what
   observers have described as a government defense research facility, and
   it comes one day after U.S. officials first told CNN that the United
   States believes Israel carried out an airstrike against Syria.

   Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the Syrian TV report. "We
   do not comment on these reports at all," an IDF spokesperson said.

   The Syrian news report claimed the rocket attack on the research center
   aided rebels, who have been battling government forces in the region.

   In late January, reports surfaced that Israeli warplanes targeted the
   research facility. The Syrian government has said the airstrike killed
   two workers and injured five others.

   A U.S. official told CNN at the time the Syrian claims were false. The
   official said Israeli fighter jets targeted a Syrian government convoy
   carrying surface-to-air missiles bound for the militant group Hezbollah
   in Lebanon. Syria denied there were such shipments.

   The report of rocket attacks come as sectarian violence erupted in
   northwestern Syria, where three consecutive days of killing by mostly
   Alawite forces have left hundreds of predominantly Sunni residents
   dead, opposition groups said Saturday.

   "The regime attacked the town of Beyda and other neighboring areas from
   the sea with rockets before security forces and militias loyal to the
   regime entered the area and conducted mass executions," Free Syrian
   Army chief of staff Gen. Salim Idris said by phone from Antakya,
   Turkey.

   "They want to establish a sectarian-based entity in the region," he
   said.

   Syrian civil war in photos Syrian civil war in photos

   State media have said their forces were seeking only to clear the area
   of "terrorists," the term they have routinely used when referring to
   rebel forces.

   But the U.S. State Department said it was "appalled by horrific reports
   that more than 100 people were killed May 2" in Beyda, a suburb of
   Baniyas.

   "We call on all responsible actors in Syria to speak out against the
   perpetration of unlawful killings against any group, regardless of
   faith or ethnicity," spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in a statement.

   Opposition groups that included the Local Coordination Committees of
   Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Free Syrian Army
   said the widespread killing in and around the coastal city of Baniyas
   continued Saturday as largely Alawite regime forces used tanks,
   battleships and missile launchers to hit largely Sunni neighborhoods in
   Baniyas.

   The government forces killed at least 200 people on Friday and Saturday
   in Baniyas and its suburbs, the LCC said Saturday.

   More than 200 others were killed there on Thursday, when the killings
   started early in the day, it said.

   Reliable information has been difficult to obtain because government
   forces controlled access to the village, the LCC said.

   The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said hundreds of Sunni families
   began fleeing Baniyas' southern neighborhoods at dawn Saturday, heading
   toward the cities of Tartous and Jableh.

   A graphic [41]video posted by activists who said it was shot in the Ras
   al-Nabaa neighborhood showed people, including an infant, lying
   lifeless on the ground. Many bore what appeared to be bullet wounds and
   some appeared burned. CNN's access to war zones has been limited by the
   government and has not been able to confirm its authenticity.

   State-run Syrian TV filed reports from Beyda over the last two days
   reporting that government troops along with the National Defense
   militia, an armed Alawite group loyal to the government, "have cleaned
   the area from armed terrorists" after "they burned civilians' homes and
   stores and terrorized the population." The reporting was supported by
   interviews with members of the Syrian army.

   U.N. has warned of sectarian violence

   Last December, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry warned that the civil war
   had become "overtly sectarian."

   It said government forces and militias, dominated by Alawites, had been
   attacking Sunnis -- who were "broadly (but not uniformly)" backing the
   rebel groups. And anti-government armed groups were targeting Alawites.

   Other minority communities, including some Christians, Armenians,
   Palestinians, Kurds and Turkmen, "have also been caught up in the
   conflict, and in some cases forced to take up arms for their own
   defense or to take sides."

   But it said the "sectarian lines fall most sharply" between Alawites
   and Sunnis.

   The "increasingly sectarian nature" of the fighting is a motivator for
   proxy groups fighting in Syria. Anti-government armed groups are
   composed of Sunnis from the Middle East and North Africa, the report
   said.

   Shiites from other countries have entered the conflict on behalf of
   Syria. The Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah has said its members are
   fighting. There are reports of Iraqi Shiites fighting in Syria and of
   Iran's Revolutionary Guards providing intellectual and advisory
   support.

   Christian communities across Syria have been under the gun and on the
   move. Homs, for example, was once home to 80,000 Christians, but the
   commission said most had escaped to Lebanon.

   "With communities believing -- not without cause -- that they face an
   existential threat, the need for a negotiated settlement is more urgent
   than ever," the commission said.

   Al-Assad makes public appearance

   Also Saturday, the country's president made his second public
   appearance this month, according to state-run Syrian Television.

   "President Bashar al-Assad joins thousands of students and families of
   martyrs in Damascus University in inaugurating the Martyred Students
   Monument in memory of all the students who were killed in Syria," it
   said.

   The president's Facebook page posted a [42]picture of the event.

   On May 1, al-Assad visited the Ummayad electrical plant to
   "congratulate its staff and all the Syrian workers on the occasion of
   International Workers' Day," the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency
   reported.

   Israel said to be flying over Lebanon

   Israel was flying warplanes over Lebanon on Thursday, Friday and
   Saturday, the Lebanese army said.

   Lebanon's president, Gen. Michel Sleiman, condemned the violations as
   "an attempt to shaken Lebanese stability," the state-run National News
   Agency reported Saturday.

   The Israeli military had no comment. But a source in the Israeli
   defense establishment told CNN's Sara Sidner, "We will do whatever is
   necessary to stop the transfer of weapons from Syria to terrorist
   organizations. We have done it in the past and we will do it if
   necessary the future."

   Israel appears to have struck Syria

   Two U.S. officials told CNN on Friday that [43]Israel appears to have
   conducted an airstrike into Syria on Thursday or Friday.

   Based on initial indications, the U.S. does not believe Israeli
   warplanes entered Syrian airspace to conduct the strikes.

   President Barack Obama told reporters on Friday that he did not foresee
   a scenario of [44]"American boots on the ground in Syria" that would be
   good for that country or the region. Obama said other leaders in the
   region want to see al-Assad out of power.
