[22]Open thread for night owls: Antarctic permafrost melting at faster than
expected rates

   night owls
   Via [29]Time:

     A [30]new study in the journal Nature Geoscience suggests that large
     of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet [31]experienced significant melting
     during the Pliocene epoch, between 5.3 and 2.6 million years ago,
     when atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide were similar to where they
     are today, and temperatures were about 2 to 3 C warmer than they are
     now. It was a time when sea levels were some 66 ft. higher than they
     are today--more than high enough to swamp coastal cities. While
     scientists knew that all of Greenland and West Antarctica had to be
     ice-free at the time, the sediment data in the Nature
     Geoscience shows that the East Antarctic ice sheet must have
     retreated a couple hundred miles inland. "The East Antarctic Ice
     Sheet has been much more sensitive to [32]climate change in the past
     than previously realized," said the study's lead author, Carys Cook
     of Imperial College London, in a statement.

     In another study, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin
     found that coastal Antarctic permafrost--which, unlike Arctic
     permafrost, was considered to be stable--is actually melting much
     faster than scientists had expected. Researchers had though that the
     permafrost in the region was in equilibrium--ice would melt during
     the summer, only to refreeze in the winter. But the Texas study,
     published in Scientific Reports, shows a rapid melting of permafrost
     in Antarctica's Garwood Valley, diminishing the overall mass of
     ground ice. "The big tell here is that ice is vanishing--it's
     melting faster each time we measure," said Joseph Levy, a research
     associate at the University of Texas's Institute for Geophysics and
     the lead author on the paper.

     "That's a dramatic shift from recent history."
            _____________________________________________________

   [33]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2006--CT-Sen:
   Bill Clinton's visit:

     Lieberman and his apologists believe that having Bill Clinton do a
   single campaign event for him will somehow convince Connecticut voters
     that Lieberman has delivered for them the past 18 years. I doubt it
       will be successful, any more than Dean's parade of high-profile
                       endorsement helped him in 2004.

   People vote for the candidate, not the candidate's friends, especially
    in a case like this where the candidate is so well known and opinions
     are so clearly defined. Lieberman's poor constituent services, his
    years-long absence from the state, and his lack of fit with voters is
    more determinate of how voters will vote on August 8th than anything
                  any blogger or even Bill Clinton can say.

   Connecticut voters don't need outsiders to tell them how to think about
                               their senators.

   On today's [39]Kagro in the Morning show, Greg Dworkin rounds up the
   latest Nate Silver discussions: math skills, yes, but it's also the
   writing. Also, a new NBC/WSJ poll shows views of race relations have
   taken a serious hit of late. Next, the suddenly exploding story of
   gonzo gun nut police chief Mark Kessler, with Alex Seitz-Wald, who
   looks this whackadoodle in today's Salon. Lots to marvel over in that
   story, and the larger effect of blurring the lines around gun issues
   across the country. Finally, we start reading & commenting on Noam
   Scheiber's "The Last Days of Big Law."

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [53]Tagging tips - [54]Search For Tags - [55]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       it's Pioneer Day here in the great state of Utah, so was able to
       hang out here more than usual.  Usually, I am working at my
       stimulus funded job, so it does make me laugh when people state
       emphatically that the stimulus created no jobs at all. Saved my
       lab's bacon.  I do wish it had been bigger, and that it had
       continued.

   that a bunch of College Republican pukes are behind this odious
   'FratPac' political operation. It fits the profile.

   If you thought frat hazing was wrong before, just wait until you read
   about "FratPAC," the fraternity industry group that lobbies against
   anti-hazing legislation.

     Mother of Golf Prodigy in Hazing Death Defied by FratPAC

     Harrison Kowiak was 19 years old when he died after schoolmates
     pummeled him on a pitch-black field in Hickory, North Carolina. It
     was part of a fraternity hazing.

     Determined to protect other students, Kowiak's mother Lianne devoted
     herself to fighting hazing. She thought she had a powerful ally in
     U.S. Representative Frederica Wilson, who calls herself the "Haze
     Buster" and backed Florida's tough anti-hazing law as a member of
     the state legislature in 2005.

     What Kowiak didn't know was that, behind the scenes, the fraternity
     industry's political arm, known as "FratPAC," had been pressing
     Wilson to back off. Today, 19 months after Wilson first promised an
     anti-hazing bill, she hasn't filed one.

     The industry's lobbying is "disgusting," Kowiak said in an
     interview. "What are the priorities here?" They "should be to stop
     hazing so none of our youth have to go through it."

       when historically black colleges complain as well.

     Wilson also heard from other opponents to her plan. Florida A&M said
     it would unfairly target minority students, who rely more heavily on
     financial aid, according to Tola Thompson, the school's director of
     governmental relations. A task force of minority educators and
     clergy formed after the A&M hazing death, and led by Tallahassee
     Reverend R.B. Holmes, said community advocacy, and not a federal
     law, would stop hazing.

     On April 25, 2012, the National Association for Equal Opportunity in
     Higher Education, which represents historically black colleges, told
     Wilson it was "concerned" that a preliminary draft of the bill
     "would single out" hazing for harsher penalties than other offenses.
       This is why we can't have nice things.

       The Japanese giant hornet spits acid venom

     Venom

     The Japanese giant hornet is large and fearsome, but it is not
     particularly aggressive unless it feels threatened. It has a venom
     which is injected by the 6.25 mm-long (quarter-inch) stinger and
     attacks the nervous system and damages tissues of its victims.[1]
     Tests with mice find the venom not to be among the most lethal,
     having an LD50 of 4.1 mg/kg, which compares to the deadliest wasp
     venom (to mice) by weight of Vespa luctuosa at 1.6 mg/kg. The
     potency of the sting is due to the relatively large amount of venom
     injected.[2] Being stung is extremely painful and requires hospital
     treatment. On average 40 people die every year of anaphylactic shock
     after having been stung,[3][1] which makes the Japanese giant hornet
     the most lethal animal in Japan (bears kill zero to five people[4]
     and venomous snakes kill five to ten people each year).

   From BBC news -- "Dutch court blocks US extradition amid torture
   claims"

     A Dutch court has blocked the extradition of a terrorism suspect to
     the United States amid concern about American collusion in his
     torture.  The 26-year-old man, known only as Sabir K, is accused of
     taking part in attacks on US forces in Afghanistan.

     He says he was tortured in Pakistan after his arrest there in 2010,
     and that the Americans knew about it.

     The judge denied the extradition request, saying the degree of US
     involvement was "unclear".

   Maybe some European governments are becoming unwilling to give the US
   the benefit of the doubt.

   We're all pretty strange one way or another; some of us just hide it
   better. "Normal" is a dryer setting.

   my inability to affect the horror that is climate change. People still
   snicker when I go on about it and I do go on about it. I am dumbfounded
   that anyone sees comedy in it all.
   I simply cannot think of a single thing to do that could possibly bring
   about the worldwide emergency level footing for a switch from carbon
   emissions and the glutting of the atmosphere with CO2. It really is
   depressing. I have children and shudder at what the planet will be like
   when they are my age.
   Anything done by any U.S. administration since the Carter era has been
   akin to swatting at flies while the problem grows exponentially more
   enormous, possibly (probably) setting us on the course to irreversibly
   altering sustainability to all life forms we are familiar with.

       a global consensus. I have, in an issue of negligible size,
       activity and import, but still it does cover the world.
       But I fit a very depressing pattern. My ideas were correct, my data
       were accurate, and my arguments reflected this. Still, I lost all
       the debates.
       Where I won was by deploying a solution that worked better for
       average people, in their hands, for their purposes, than the
       prevailing consensus.
       Even that wasn't immediate. In the beginning people would try my
       approach, acknowledge that it was more straightforward and
       uncomplicated, but reject it because of all the time and energy
       they'd invested in learning to outfox the quirks of the balky and
       erratic methods.
       Years ago there was a story I think out of the Columbus zoo about a
       rhino or hippo that was let out of its cage into a larger,
       naturalistic space. It wouldn't leave the cage for days, having
       grown up thinking of it as its entire world.

   US-spy ops/Germany: social dems intend to mock secret service
   coordinator with question catalogue+

   [854]http://ccoaler.com/...

   Berlin - Around seven weeks have passed since the former NSA employee
   Edward Snowden revealed the potentially widespread spying in Germany by
   the US secret service. During these seven weeks, new details about the
   work of American agents on German soil became known but the federal
   Government seems 2 b ostentatiously unaware.
   Four meetings of the secret services parliamentary supervisory
   commission have changed nothing. On thursday, the MPs come 2gether for
   the fifth time  . Whether it is possible to bring a little light into
   the darkness of the NSA scandal? SPIEGEL ONLINE explains what is at
   stake behind the closed doors of the secret services parliamentary
   supervisory commission.
   Occasion for the special session is the latest Spiegel.de report on the
   close cooperation of German intelligence services with the American
   National Security Agency. Chancellor's office (Minister) head Ronald
   Pofalla (CDU) is supposed to answer questions of the secret services
   parliamentary supervisory commission. Pofalla  was noticable in the NSA
   scandal so far mainly through his extreme silence, although he is
   responsible within the government for the coordination of the German
   intelligence services.
   Not to cope with the cross-examination of the opposition alone, Pofalla
   dishes reinforcements. Next to him, all chiefs of the intelligence
   services will appear, namely Gerhard Schindler of the foreign
   intelligence service (BND), the president of the domestic secret
   service (BfV), Hans-Georg Maaßen, and Ulrich Birkenheier, head of the
   military intelligence (MAD). Also the head of the federal office for
   security in information technology (BSI), Michael Hange is expected to
   appear. As well, the secretaries of state of interior and defence,
   Klaus-Dieter Fritsche, and Rüdiger Wolf take part in the meeting. With
   the  large human committment, the federal government wants to counter
   the offensive. "The men are ready to stay, 2 answer the last question,"
   deputy government spokesman Georg Streiter announced .

 Climate Change Driving GOP Billionaire Power Grabs ([857]0+ / 0-)

   I tend to think it is some crackpot apocalyptic belief, but is is peak
   oil, currency collapse, demographic apocalypse, climate change, the
   Rapture?

   But what if it's like Soylent Green where there is an actual report,
   and the powerful people have the inside scoop on the end of the world.
    Suddenly nobody cares about the future or business or education - it's
   all about turning states into billionaire compounds with a militarized
   police force prepared to smash uncontrollable civil unrest.

   Men are so necessarily mad that not to be mad would amount to another
   form of madness -Pascal

 Feeling pleasure, delivering pain. ([864]0+ / 0-)

   I ran across this very perplexing question and aswer on the internet:

     Is Abortion and Masturbating the same thing?
     Nope, its not the same.
     Masturbating is like cracking an egg, while abortion is like
     strangling a live chicken.

   I spent hours examining the wisdom of this exchange. I just couldn't
   get anywhere with it.

   I settled on a much simpler proposition:

   Masturbation was evolution's purpose for the opposable thumb.

   I do believe in Darwin, I do believe in Darwin, I do, I do, I do

 66 foot rise? ([886]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [887]forgore

     ``It was a time when sea levels were some 66 ft. higher than they
     are today--more than high enough to swamp coastal cities.''

   Well, that'll neatly answer the question "What's wrong with Florida?"
   Answer: It's under water.

   The New Orleans problem will be solved as well as it will be entirely
   under water; not just the low-income neighborhoods. There's no way any
   levee will -- or, more likely, can -- be built to keep that much water
   out.

   Someone please find a topographic map that shows what a 60+ foot
   increase in sea level would do to this country.
