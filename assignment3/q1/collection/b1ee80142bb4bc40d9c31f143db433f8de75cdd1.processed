     * Hopefully he'll get the help he [33]needs:

     A Nevada Democratic assemblyman whose erratic behavior dominated
     headlines for weeks will go down in history as the first lawmaker
     ever expelled from the state Legislature by his peers.

     The Nevada Assembly voted Thursday in a somber, emotional hearing to
     oust Assemblyman Steven Brooks, 41. Several members were heard
     crying, and Majority Leader William Horne said people did not feel
     safe with Brooks in the legislative building.
     Brooks, who won reelection in November, has been arrested twice
     since January and is accused of making threats toward his
     colleagues, including Assembly Speaker Marilyn Kirkpatrick.

     * No one is [37]safe:

     Credit-card fraud can strike anyone, anywhere. Ask Chief Justice
     John Roberts.

     Roberts usually uses a credit card to buy his morning coffee at his
     local Starbucks in suburban Maryland.
     But on Tuesday, when he needed to be extra sharp for the arguments
     that day over California's ban on same-sex marriage, he had to pay
     in cash.
     Seems someone had gotten his credit-card numbers, he told the
     cashier, and he was obliged to cancel the card.
     * First he [38]stole beer because he had to go to the bathroom and
       now he's [39]shoplifted a bag of nuts because of a conspiracy
       against him ... or something like that:

     The tough-on-crime former Republican candidate for Alabama
     Agriculture Commissioner is in trouble with the law - for the second
     time in less than six months.

     Dale Peterson, who brandished a rifle and talked tough about
     criminals and thugs in a 2010 political ad that went viral on the
     internet, was arrested in Hoover this afternoon after authorities
     said he shoplifted from Sam's Club on Alabama 150. In the hours
     following his arrest, Peterson took to Twitter to explain his
     situation.
     * Okay, there's faithful and then there's effing [40]crazy:

     At least 16 devotees have been nailed to crosses in the northern
     Philippines during an annual Good Friday reenactment of the
     crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The celebration mixes Roman Catholic
     devotion with Filipino folk beliefs on sacrifices and miracles.

       On today's [44]Kagro in the Morning show: Greg Dworkin on CT's
       progress toward new gun measures, and new polling saying fervor for
       reform hasn't dimmed. "Moms Demand Action" draws a counter-protest:
       guys with AR-15s. Just one of the weird meta issues arising from
       protesting about guns by showing up with guns. City council
       declares all future gun restrictions unconstitutional, because they
       love the Constitution except for supremacy and also the separation
       of powers. Despite her CPAC railing against consultants, most of
       Sarah Palin's PAC money went to... consultants. WalMart now wants
       you to pay them to work there.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [55]Tagging tips - [56]Search For Tags - [57]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Paul Krugman: "Cheating Our Children" ([81]2+ / 0-)

 Question about the DOMA case ([104]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [105]Gooserock, [106]speak2me, [107]LilithGardener

   I'm sure this has already been asked, but if the justices decide not to
   rule on the case because of standing, what happens to the law? Will the
   lower court ruling, which ruled it unconstitutional, stand? Or will the
   law effectively be upheld?

   I ask, because I read some conservatives are hoping the justices pass
   on the case due to standing, because then the law stays in place, and
   it will apparently be Obama's fault for not defending it.

       But that may be the best political outcome for Republicans
       considering the midterm election coming up. Maybe that's why
       righties are hoping for the Court to decline to rule.

     The Obama White House and its allies are engaged in the kind of
     sky-is-falling melodrama normally reserved for the lives of teenage
     girls. (As the mother of teenage girls, I speak with authority on
     this, though the comparison does a disservice to teenagers.) With
     our attention diverted by each fiscal cliff or sequestration drama,
     we are at risk of missing the real threats to the republic.

     President Obama is the most radical man ever to occupy the Oval
     Office. The national debt, which he is intent on increasing, has
     passed $16 trillion. He believes that more government borrowing and
     spending are the solution to every problem. He seems unaware that
     the free-enterprise system has lifted more people out of poverty
     than any other economic system devised by man.

     Perhaps his ignorance of that fact explains his hostility toward the
     private sector. In one of his autobiographies, the president writes
     that he felt "like a spy behind enemy lines" during his brief stint
     working for private industry.

     Dr. Ben Carson, GOP Hero, Exiled by His Own Medical School

     Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon-turned-conservative-pundit, has
     accumulated legions of right-leaning fans since he stumped at the
     National Prayer Breakfast in February and, later, began appearing on
     Fox News Channel. But after delivering widely condemned comments
     regarding gay people on Fox this week, a group of students at Johns
     Hopkins, where Carson has worked since 1977, has successfully
     stopped Carson from speaking at the May commencement ceremony of the
     university's medical school. Carson announced on MSNBC Friday
     afternoon that he would refrain from speaking because he thought the
     ceremony should be devoted to students, and not the controversy
     swirling around him:

       It seemed a bit sudden.  Perhaps the valves were busted?  But the
       original release looked not only very explosive, but very dirty.
       Maybe the other side of the release was already under the mud?

 It looked bad, but the annual spring floods on ([228]0+ / 0-)
       a natural river move a lot of sediment, clear invasive vegetation
       from riverbanks, rebuild sandbars... and kill some critters.
       There was much controversy the first time a "scour" flood was
       released on the Colorado River in 1996, but it's an annual event
       now.
       The other thing is that the volume behind an old dam can be up to
       90% sediment. it's pretty expensive to remove six million cubic
       yard of silt with a backhoe.
       I live near Matilija Dam in SoCal. It's fifty years old, silted up
       and no longer functional either as a reservoir or for flood
       control.
       But this dam is not deep in the wilderness. There's a lot of
       agriculture downstream and the river habitat is pretty fragile. It
       doesn't rain enough here to move  a glut of sediment down to the
       sea quickly, so the decision was made to "notch" the dam, from the
       top down, to release the silt incrementally.
       We're waiting to see how it goes. The reasons for removing this dam
       are to give the double the spawning grounds of the  local steelhead
       trout, and to and restore natural flows of sand that replenish
       local beaches.
       It may take fifty years, or an expensive pipeline to the sea may
       have to be constructed.

 Kramnik to challenge Anand for chess championship ([237]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [238]koNko

   The FIDE Candidates' Tournament in London just ended. Vladimir Kramnik
   beat Levon Aronian, with whom he finished dead even in a six-game match
   last year, while Vassily Ivanchuk got the better of top-rated Magnus
   Carlsen, who had been leading the tournament. So it's a clear win for
   Kramnik, who'll go on to challenge world champion Viswanathan Anand.

 Peterson's behavior is perfectly understandable ([241]0+ / 0-)

   Grab a couple of cases of beer and sooner or later you have to take a
   piss. This time is was sooner.

   Eat a can of cashews before you clear aisle 9 and chances are you will
   go nuts.
