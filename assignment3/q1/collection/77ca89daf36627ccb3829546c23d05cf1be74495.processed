   SAN FRANCISCO--Using such products as pineapple-scented shampoo and
   raspberry sorbet body wash, 28-year-old Stephanie Holden apparently
   likes to smell like she wants other people to eat her, sources
   confirmed Tuesday. "I really like this vanilla-coconut fragrance, but
   sometimes I like to switch it up and use this blueberry stuff I got at
   Sephora," said the woman in what would seem to be a concerted effort on
   her part to make friends, dates, and fellow pedestrians want to place
   her in a bowl, put a pinch of sugar on her, and then consume her. "I
   just like to smell [like food, apparently]." At press time, Holden's
   milk-chocolate-scented hair was being gnawed on by three of her
   coworkers.
