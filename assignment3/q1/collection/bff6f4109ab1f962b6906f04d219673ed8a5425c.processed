Technology's Promise to Education: Reimagining Textbooks

     Here's an excerpt from my speech at the NAIS Annual Conference on
     how teaching and learning will be transformed in the decade ahead.

   I believe technology can help teachers be more effective and make
   learning more interesting. I've been watching what's been happening
   with these technologies very closely. Despite the clear momentum, we
   are still very early in this movement. There are so many entrepreneurs,
   so many programs and resources available, it can be challenging to know
   where to start.

   I see four main 'flavors' of online learning: reimagining textbooks,
   scaling our best teachers, connecting through social networks, and
   personalizing learning.

   Reimagining Textbooks
   Many teachers are doing this already by supplementing coursework with
   material online. It's about taking information that is traditionally
   communicated via a textbook, and making it more engaging and
   interactive.
     * Inkling is focused on turning existing textbooks into interactive
       learning environments on the iPad. Notes and highlighting are
       social, hinting at the potential for much greater student
       collaboration. Assessments provide instant feedback as students
       test their own understanding.

     * Services like CK-12 make it easy for teachers to assemble their own
       textbooks. Content is mapped to a variety of levels and standards
       including common core. You can start from scratch or build from
       anything the the FlexBooks library.

     * Gooru is making it easier to find and use educational content from
       across the internet. They've made over 2,600 collections freely
       available, all curated for quality and aligned to standards by
       teachers and Gooru's own content experts.

   There really is no limit to what teachers can do if they have the right
   resources. A decade from now, finding and using the best content and
   technology will be as natural as opening a book. Tablets and high-speed
   Internet access will be ubiquitous. Each student will have a learning
   map that helps chart their interests and learning path inside and
   outside the classroom. And the concept of the textbook will
   fade--replaced by easy online access to the best lectures and course
   materials available.
