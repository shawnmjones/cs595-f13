   Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Sara Hunt, a 25-year-old with a big
   smile and an enormous sense of cheery determination, never seems to do
   anything halfway.

   She loves softball, so she plays on four teams.

   She felt out of shape last year, so she decided to run the Boston
   Marathon.
   John D. Sutter

   When that race was hit with two explosions that killed three people and
   injured scores more, Hunt didn't want to wait until next year to
   complete her first marathon. She traveled to Oklahoma City over the
   weekend to run in one that memorializes the 1995 bombing that killed
   168 people there.

   She wanted to finish what she started.

   I was struck by Hunt's courage: to want to run a marathon again after
   only 13 days of rest; to do so knowing that the closer she got to the
   finish line the more she would have to confront her memories of the
   bombing in Boston; to immerse herself in another city that knows
   tragedy all too well.

   I was so impressed by her story -- by her desire to learn from the
   survivors in Oklahoma City -- that I traveled there to watch her run.

   It was a homecoming of sorts for me. I grew up in the Oklahoma City
   area and heard the explosion that changed so many lives in my hometown.

   Perhaps that is the reason I felt a personal connection to the people
   who were injured and killed at the marathon in Boston. And it's
   probably why I was so interested in a group of people online who were
   pledging to "[46]Run for Boston" in the wake of that tragedy. Instead
   of being afraid, they laced up their shoes and hit the pavement.
   There's something powerful and symbolic in that action, and I decided
   to join them, [47]pledging to run a marathon by the 1-year anniversary
   of the Boston bombing and [48]creating an iReport page on CNN where you
   can sign up to do the same. So far, more than 300 people have.

   I also used this trip as a way to explore in more detail how my home
   city has been able to move past the tragedy. OKC is known for all sorts
   of things now -- an NBA team [49]with a humble superstar; a river that
   hosts world-class [50]regattas; a [51]weight-loss-crazy mayor; a new
   (and way-too-enormous) [52]skyscraper that went up amid a recession,
   thanks to a boon in the natural gas industry. But when I lived here,
   when that bomb went off, tragedy defined the place.

   For years, when I told people I was from OKC, the next question usually
   was, "Were you there during the bombing?" I rarely get asked that these
   days.

   Hunt seemed to be on a similar journey of discovery, but for different
   reasons. In Boston, she had completed nearly 26 miles of the 26.2-mile
   route when the blasts ended the race.
   What it means to be 'Boston strong'
   Why give bombing suspect Miranda rights?
   Fmr. CIA: Suspects didn't act alone

   Of course, there were much greater tragedies that occurred that day.
   Spectators lost limbs. An 8-year-old boy was among the dead. But the
   attack shook Hunt. Now, sudden noises, like balloons popping, make her
   jump, sometimes to the point that she covers her head for protection.
   The sounds take her back to the moment she heard the blast and saw the
   smoke rising above Boston, when runners turned around in panic and
   rushed the other way. She was terrified, unsure what had happened.

   "It was like being in a movie," she told me. "Seeing the trucks and
   bomb squads ... I'm from a small town. We don't even have police where
   I live."

   For an hour and a half after the bombing, the young woman from Putnam,
   Connecticut, was unable to reach her mom, who had been standing at the
   finish line, near the explosions. Her mother was unharmed, but that was
   a frantic hour, spent begging strangers to let her use their cell
   phones.

   So, Hunt came to Oklahoma City with a dual mission: She wanted to
   finish the race she had started, but she also wanted to look for clues
   about how to move through a tragedy, how to process it so it will cease
   to haunt her.

   "It's another community that's gone through something like (the Boston
   bombing)," she said. "It's nice to talk to people who know what you've
   seen and gone through."

   As it turned out, many of the clues she received came from strangers --
   those she met on the course, and those who influenced its very
   existence.

   'Runners are like the wind'

   The thought that Oklahoma City could be bombed again had occurred to
   her.

   But Hunt didn't want to let that interfere.

   When she arrived downtown, before 5 a.m., a three-quarter moon hanging
   in the sky, the only change she made to her routine was to bring a cell
   phone.

   She hadn't done that on a run before. But she wanted one in Oklahoma.

   Just in case.

   It was a chilly 50 degrees that morning. Runners gathered early for a
   sunrise service beneath an American Elm that locals call the "survivor
   tree." It nearly shriveled up and died after the bombing. Eighteen
   years later, it still has some scars and gnarly branches, but it's also
   tall and green and full of life.

   Hunt listened as a preacher told the runners who had gathered in the
   dark for a blessing before the race that they didn't need to think
   about the path ahead. A higher power would carry them onward.

   He encouraged them to think of each breath as "a sublime gift" from
   above.

   Hunt didn't meet him, but standing elsewhere beneath the tree was Tom
   Kight, a 74-year-old Oklahoma City man dressed in a red pullover, in
   honor of Boston's Red Sox. (He couldn't find the socks, which many
   runners in Oklahoma City wore as a tribute to the victims in Boston.)
   He comes to this spot every year to remember his stepdaughter, Frankie
   Ann Merrell, who was killed in the Oklahoma City bombing.

   The service beneath the tree is a highlight of Kight's year. He loves
   the sunrise, the anticipation. The powerful symbolism of running for
   progress.

   "Runners are like the wind," he said. "There's nothing that stops
   them."

   Kight, who has knee problems that prevent him from running, has made it
   his personal mission to ensure that the names of all 168 Oklahoma City
   bombing victims appear on the jerseys of runners in the race.

   It's important to him that the victims' names live on. Seeing the names
   gives new life to those who died here. And it brings him incredible
   comfort.

   "We're not going to forget the people in Boston," he said. "You can
   rest assured."

   'We will finish this race'

   If the bombing wasn't already on Hunt's mind, it would have been
   impossible to escape it in the early morning hours in Oklahoma City.

   Helicopters circled like buzzards. Police were everywhere. A moment of
   silence was held for the victims -- 168 seconds for Oklahoma City;
   three for Boston.

   And then there was the location.

   The race starts where the Alfred P. Murrah building once stood -- until
   the bombing on April 19, 1995. The memorial to that site -- a field
   with one empty chair for each victim and two large metal gates, marked
   9:01 and 9:03, bookending that moment in time -- butts right up against
   the starting line.

   The race begins on the 9:03 side, a symbol of moving forward.

   But it's also a reminder that tragedy can strike anywhere, anytime.

   Crowds were thick as more than 25,000 runners geared up to start. Some
   ran in quick circles to get loose. Others leaned on each other for
   warmth. One man swooshed his hips around in a hula-hooping motion.
   (Aren't these people about to get enough exercise?) A man barked over a
   loudspeaker in a voice that seemed more fit for a football stadium: "We
   stand as one, showing the world that good always overcomes evil ..."
   the voice said. "We will finish this race."

   Even at the start, Hunt was unwaveringly sure she could do just that.

   "I have good endurance," she told me beforehand. "I don't give up on
   things."

   She wore a "Boston Strong" sign on her stomach and her race number from
   the April 15 Boston Marathon on her back. Two Boston bracelets dangled
   on her wrist.

   Her get-up attracted the attention of another Boston runner, who
   decided to run the start of the race by her side. It turned out both
   had been turned around by the blast in Boston at nearly the same time.
   Both offered words of encouragement, Hunt told me. Together, they vowed
   to cross the finish, for themselves and for Boston.

   'I couldn't move'

   It wasn't long before Hunt's new running mate had left her behind. She
   didn't take offense at that -- this was her race and she intended to
   run it on her own terms.

   The cheers of the crowd fueled her.

   About an hour into the race, Hunt ran by Terri Talley, 45, who was
   dumping pitcher after pitcher of a yellow sports drink into tiny paper
   cups. Others passed the cups to the runners. Down the road, volunteers
   used rakes to scrape the empty cups into piles, as if they were
   cleaning up leaves from an autumn yard. "Celebration" was playing on an
   outdoor sound system when I walked up. A woman cheered through a
   megaphone. Others danced with pom-poms.

   She doesn't tell any of the runners about it, but Talley, a peppy woman
   with blond highlights in her hair and small rhinestones on the temples
   of her glasses, worked on the third floor of the building that was
   bombed in 1995.

   She was buried in the rubble and nearly died.

   "I couldn't move," she said. "As hard as I tried to move, I couldn't
   move."

   Talley was coming in and out of consciousness when rescue workers found
   her trapped in a vertical wall of rubble and debris. All they could
   see, she said, was her butt, which caught their attention in part
   because she was wearing a suit with a loud houndstooth pattern. She
   jokes that it's her backside that saved her.

   "I always say, 'Thank you, Mom and Dad for giving me a nice size
   booty,'" she told me, laughing. That's something she's only been able
   to do with distance.

   Three rescuers stayed through a second bomb scare, she said, to pull
   her from the rubble when others had left the disaster site, fearing for
   their lives.

   "When they pulled me out, I was blue and I was losing oxygen. I
   probably would have died if they had left me" during the second scare,
   she said.

   She still keeps in touch with one rescuer and her ambulance driver.

   Talley said she'll never put the tragedy behind her. Eighteen of her 33
   coworkers at a credit union were killed that day, she said. For years,
   she had nightmares. Blooming trees and flowers can cause her to slide
   into depression.

   "Everything about the month of April makes you really, really think
   about that. Even though it's been 18 years, it seems like not so long
   ago."

   On Sunday, the sun was out and flowers were in bloom. But Talley was in
   high spirits. Seeing all these strangers running for her friends who
   died, and in support of her ongoing recovery, is an intense and
   meaningful experience.

   Her advice for runners like Hunt who experienced something in Boston
   that may change them for a long time, if not permanently?

   Keep doing marathons -- or get deeply involved in another community
   activity.

   "Always be around a marathon," she said. "Whether you can run it or
   not, there's such energy from a marathon."

   'I'm not in New England anymore'

   Hunt's energy reserves seemed nearly exhausted around the halfway mark.
   It's not that she was out of fuel, but she could feel a new tightness
   in her legs; she figured it was residual from the marathon she ran less
   than two weeks before.

   I caught up with her briefly between miles 17 and 18.

   She had spoken with her mom on the phone a mile or so before. That was
   a good pick-me-up, she said. Her mom is one reason she was running in
   the first place.

   Hunt had never run a marathon before Boston, and was able to enter that
   time-regulated race because she was raising money -- about $3,000 --
   for cancer research and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Her mom was
   diagnosed with a rare, cancerous tumor on her face about two years ago,
   she said. The treatment was "hard to watch," she said, because it
   involved radiation that burned her mother's face.

   Hunt also had scares with cancerous cells in her cervix a few years
   ago.

   She had only taken up running about a year before Boston. It started
   with a one-mile run -- she wanted to test herself. With characteristic
   gusto, she ended up running more than a dozen races over the course of
   the year.

   Hearing her story makes me believe I'll be able to complete a marathon
   by next year. She makes it sound so easy. You just have to commit. And
   then go.

   She trained largely by herself, and lost more than 50 pounds in the
   process.

   As I trotted along beside her for five or 10 minutes, I noticed she was
   sweating, and she told me she hadn't expected it to be this hot or
   hilly in Oklahoma. Temperatures topped 80 degrees that afternoon. When
   I found her, she was walking down a hill in a neighborhood, conserving
   energy and taking it slow because of the heat.

   "I'm not in New England anymore," she said.

   Throughout the morning, she kept hearing sirens, too.

   At one point an ambulance drove by, and she covered her ears. Those
   noises put her back in Boston, and the panic that followed the bombs.

   'You gotta pay it forward'

   Early in the morning, the pack of runners looked like a pulsing river
   of humanity, thousands of heads bobbing down the same stream, churning
   in a sort of collective, perpetual energy. From afar, it looked like no
   individual had to expend any effort.

   Anyone could do this, I thought. It's like "Finding Nemo." Just keep
   running.

   But around the halfway point, the runners, including Hunt, had thinned
   out into individual dribs and drabs. It became clear that some might
   not make it. There were people whose feet barely looked to be leaving
   the ground. Others were so drenched in sweat they almost looked as
   though they just popped out of a lake. It was sometimes frantic and
   painful to watch.

   It suddenly made sense why there were medic tents nearby.

   Apparently some people's nipples bleed by the time they reach the
   finish.

   Running a marathon really is no joke.

   Another person I saw near mile 17 was Gary Woodbridge, 47. He said he
   was so tired that he had left his earphones in his ears even though his
   phone had lost power.

   Taking out the earphones would be too much effort, he said, smiling.

   Woodbridge ran with a name on his bib: Ronota Newberry-Woodbridge.

   That's the wife he lost in the Oklahoma City bombing.

   "She always wanted to run a marathon and I finally lost enough weight
   where I thought I could try," he told me before the race. "I'm not
   getting any younger."

   Memories of her, and their runs together, occupied his thoughts.

   "I'm still moving," he said. "I feel every step."

   Woodbridge waited 11 days to learn his wife was dead. He spent much of
   that time at First Christian Church, another site on the marathon
   route, which became a support center for families who were in that
   limbo. The thing that has helped him move forward from her death is
   talking to other people, he said. "Your grief is going to be very
   unique. It's going to be very unique to you," he said. "But there are
   people who have been through what you've been through."

   Reaching out to help others was also important for him. He has
   volunteered to talk to kids who have lost loved ones. And he went to
   New York after the 9/11 attacks.

   "I was shown so much love" after the Oklahoma City bombing, he said.
   "You gotta pay it forward."

   As I walked back to the car from that spot in the course, I saw a man
   on one knee in front of a lamppost, one hand on the pole and head
   bowed.

   I assumed he was vomiting. That wouldn't have seemed out of place.

   But then I realized there was a banner at the top of the pole -- one of
   168 signs with a name of an Oklahoma City victim on it. I gave him some
   space and then asked, after he'd rejoined the runners, if Antonio
   "Tony" C. Reyes, the name on the banner, was someone he'd known
   personally. A friend? A family member?

   No, he said. "That's someone I run for every year."

   He ran in honor of a stranger.

   'Well, run with me'

   Hunt found a bigger challenge at the 20-mile mark.

   Before the race, she had insisted on not knowing the course route.

   "If it's a hill, it's a hill," she said. "I'll have to run it.

   So no one had told her that the last several miles of the Oklahoma City
   marathon course go gradually uphill toward the finish line.

   Discouraged by the heat and the elevation changes, Hunt started walking
   again. The pain of the race was setting in. Maybe her legs weren't
   invincible after all.

   But a woman from Tennessee came to her rescue.

   She approached her and asked about the Boston number on her back. Hunt
   told her the story: the training, the bombing, the disappointment. And
   the fear. How it was too soon for even a serious marathoner to be
   running a race again.

   How she was really just a beginner.

   "She was like, 'well, run with me,'" Hunt recalled.

   "It definitely helped."

   So did the cheers from anonymous fans.

   Soon, Hunt was approaching the mile-marker in the race where the bomb
   went off in Boston, when she saw the cloud of smoke rising from the
   city and the runners frantically turning the other direction and
   running in panic, fearing for their lives.

   Instead of being afraid, she felt motivated.

   "Once I hit the point where I stopped in Boston, I was like, 'No more
   walking. I'm running this. This race, this is for Boston. I'm
   finishing.'"

   'On top of the world'

   I saw Hunt on the home stretch, headed for the core of downtown
   Oklahoma City, with a smile plastered across her face. Fans stood on
   both sides of Broadway Avenue, ringing cowbells, shouting "woo!!" and
   "you got it!!" and "let's go!!!" All of that stuff would seem
   annoyingly over-energized on any normal Sunday morning. But here it was
   infectious. I found myself joining in, cheering hardest for the people
   who were walking or jogging the slowest, those who looked like they
   would barely make it. I saw one man stop to vomit and then continue
   toward the finish. I mean, wow.

   No one seemed concerned about bombs or terror.

   "We all run for a reason here!" an announcer said. "We run to
   remember!"

   Hunt said she left the traumatic memories mostly behind on that last
   stretch.

   When she crossed the finish line, after having that experience robbed
   from her in Boston, and knowing that so many people had so much more
   taken from them on that day, she threw her arms into the air. Tears
   came to her eyes, but she quickly wiped them away. She's too tough for
   that. "When I saw (the finish) I couldn't stop running," she said.
   "Even though I was dying, I wanted to keep going."

   She added: "I'm on top of the world right now."

   The thing that kept her moving was the aid of complete strangers.

   'A step in her healing'

   Earlier in the week, before the marathon, I met with Ernestine Clark,
   69, who was in a library near the Murrah Building when it was bombed.
   I'd read about her story online and was amazed by the steps she'd taken
   to create something positive out of a horrifying experience.

   I wanted to learn something from her about paying it forward. I thought
   it might help with my Run for Boston project, which essentially is
   trying to bring strangers together to support the people of that
   community.

   And I also thought it might help Hunt.

   Clark greeted me at her door with a smile on Saturday morning, wearing
   pearl earrings and red glasses. We talked for a while in her living
   room and then she told me she wanted to show me something in her
   backyard, which is well gardened and is filled with the soothing clang
   of wind chimes.

   It was an elm, taller than her house.

   She told me it grew from a tiny sapling from the survivor tree at the
   bombing site.

   She put a metal sign at the base of the tree, explaining its origins --
   that this tree grew out of tragedy and was now probably the best and
   sturdiest plant in the yard. When she dies and the house goes to
   someone else, she said, she wants the new buyer to know about the tree.
   That way, if he or she cuts it down, they'll know they're going
   straight to hell, she told me, laughing wildly.

   Clark told me about the nightmares she had after the bombing. They
   lasted for three years. Many nights she dreamed she knew of an imminent
   bomb attack, but that she was unable to evacuate or warn people in
   time. She worked in the Oklahoma City library at the time of the
   bombing. It shattered the window and blew her out of a room and into a
   hallway. She told me how she staggered around downtown in a daze. All
   the buildings seemed like they were bending toward her.

   "At times, I felt I was crazy," she told me. "I would look into the
   mirror and I would just not know who that person was. It took me down
   to the quick."

   In an experience that parallels Hunt's, Clark once jumped under a table
   at dinner when the restaurant's air conditioner popped on suddenly.
   Shattering a drinking glass once brought her to tears. It reminded her
   of the glass that was broken in the bombing, that stuck in the sides of
   the survivor tree, and that made its way between the pages of many of
   the library's books.

   When she couldn't sleep, Clark made a pact with another survivor to go
   sit in the dark at the bombing memorial downtown, where the OKC
   marathon begins.

   They would sit in the dark in silence holding hands.

   Just for comfort. Just to be there.

   She also wrote. She bought her first computer after the bombing and she
   told that machine about what she had seen in 1995 before she could tell
   another person.

   Clark isn't able to walk well enough to go to the marathon these days,
   but she was instrumental in planning and shaping the memorial that it
   commemorates. She's been a quiet but adamant representative for victims
   of the tragedy and their families.

   I told Clark a little bit about Hunt, the runner from Connecticut. How
   she wanted to finish what she'd started. How she was looking for
   answers in this city. Clark said the Oklahoma City marathon "will be a
   step in her healing."

   "There will be many, many more," she said.

   And then she said something kind of amazing.

   She offered to help a stranger.

   It's something she's done many times. She received letters from all
   over the country after the Oklahoma City bombing. Talking to strangers
   shortly after the blast was easier than speaking to her own family
   members, she said. They brought her comfort. They helped her get to the
   point where she could join society again.

   She's done a great deal to pay that back. She visited Cameroon to meet
   with people who live in a village that was decimated by a volcanic
   eruption in the 1980s. She befriended her translator there and
   eventually helped him earn a scholarship to attend graduate school at
   her alma mater, Oklahoma State University.

   She wrote letters to people in Columbine. After the Boston Marathon
   bombing, she encouraged church members to make a sign showing support
   for the victims. They sent it to another church of the same
   denomination in Boston.

   "The day of the Boston Marathon, that just put me in a deep hole," she
   said. "I cried all day. (Tragedies like that) can throw you back there.

   "The difference is, after 18 years, I can pull myself out of it."

   When I mentioned Hunt, she didn't hesitate to say that if the young
   woman from the Boston area ever needs to talk to someone, she should
   get her number from me and give her a call.

   After all, what are strangers for?
