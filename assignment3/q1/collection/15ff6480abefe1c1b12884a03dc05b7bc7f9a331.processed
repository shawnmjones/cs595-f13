   Playing politics with the ballot: conflicts of interest for Michigan's
   Board of State Canvassers

   A second potential conflict of interest has appeared on the Board of
   State Canvassers. That's the bipartisan state panel that approves
   petitions and decides whether questions will go on the statewide
   ballot.

   In both cases, the panel members have business or employment interests
   in the issues put in front of them. They're big, too, and controversial
   - a potential challenge to Michigan's emergency manager law and a
   preemptive strike at "right-to-work" legislation.

   The Board of State Canvassers is very partisan - by design. The state
   Republican and Democratic parties each get to nominate people to be on
   the panel. The governor has to choose from the nominees, two from each
   party. It takes the votes of at least three of the four to get anything
   done.
   Julie Matuzak is a Democrat who chairs the board.

   "It is intended that those four people represent the world view of
   their party," said Matuzak. "They are partisan activists. That's the
   whole point of being on here. What makes the system fair is it takes
   three votes on the board of canvassers to do anything."

   Last month, the Board of Canvassers gave its O-K for a petition drive
   to go forward that would put a question on the ballot to forestall a
   right-to-work law in Michigan and roll back some Republican legislation
   that restricts union organizing and fundraising.
   The approval only means the form of the petition meets all the
   technical requirements in state law. That's basically size and
   placement of the type.

   One of the votes to allow the Protect Our Jobs petition drive to go
   forward was Matuzak's. But she never disclosed that part of her
   regular, full-time job is to get that very question on the ballot.
   Matuzak is the political coordinator for the American Federation of
   Teachers of Michigan. And her job includes getting A-F-T members to
   sign and circulate the petitions. But Matuzak says she sees no problem
   with that.

   "In my case, my union, along with every other union in the state is
   supporting the Protect Our Jobs petition drive and trying to get our
   members to sign it," she said. " I do many other things for the union,
   as well, but that is clearly one of the things that I do. Again, it's
   designed to have two members of each of the major political parties on
   here and again, it requires three votes to do anything."

   A Republican on the board also has an interest in a pending matter
   before it. Jeff Timmer is a partner in Sterling Corporation, a
   political firm that works for Republicans and conservative causes. One
   of Sterling's clients - one that even shares its business address - is
   Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility. It's a ballot campaign committee
   that has filed five separate technical challenges to the petition to
   put a referendum on Michigan's emergency manager law on the ballot.

   Hundreds of thousands of voters signed the petitions.

   Jeff Timmer refused requests to be interviewed until after the next
   meeting of the board of canvassers when  -- unless he recuses himself
   -- Timmer will have to decide whether to vote for or against a client.

   "It would be nice not to have people like that around this table." Said
   John Chamberlin, a professor of ethics and political science at the
   University of Michigan. He's talking about both Timmer and Matuzak.

   "It's an inherent conflict of interest when somebody deciding whether
   something will go forward in the political realm has an interest in the
   outcome, either a financial interest or a political interest that is a
   deeper interest then they are a Democrat or a Republican," he said.

   Chamberlain acknowledges the prospect of losing one or more people on a
   four-person board on any particular question does pose a dilemma:

   "On a committee this size, to have somebody recuse themselves because
   their fingerprints are on the issue at hand is a problem. If it were a
   12-person body, it might not be."

   Changing the structure of the Board of State Canvassers would require
   amending the state constitution. By the way, if that were done by
   petition drive, the issue would go before the canvassers. Chamberlin
   says another solution would be for political parties and the governor's
   office to be more careful (or less cynical) about who gets named to the
   board.
