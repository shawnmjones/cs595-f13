[22]Open thread for night owls: To repeat, U.S. taxes aren't high
comparatively

   Purple-eyes twin owls
   As has been pointed out numerous times here, including in [29]Analysis:
   Dow 30 companies show what a joke calling corporate tax burden 'heavy'
   has become, the idea that the United States somehow has become buried
   in taxes compared with other well-off, developed nations is bogus.
   Travis Waldron [30]pointed that out again Monday:

   President Obama and Senate Democrats have presented deficit reduction
   plans that would rely on both spending cuts and increased tax revenues,
   but Republicans continue to insist that the U.S. has only a "spending
   problem" and that deficit reduction does not require new revenues.

   The premise of the argument from Republicans is that Americans already
   face an extraordinarily heavy tax burden. Citizens for Tax Justice,
   however, compared levels of taxation in 2010 in the other
   industrialized countries that make up the Organization for Economic
   Cooperation and Development (OECD) and found that the U.S. not only
   collects far less in tax revenues than the average OECD country, but
   that it also collects less in taxes as a share of its economy than all
   but two other OECD nations, as the chart at right shows. [...]

   The U.S. has historically collected less in taxes and spent less than
   the majority of its OECD counterparts, in part because it operates such
   a stingy social safety net that doesn't assist the least fortunate in
   society as well as programs in other countries do. Still, the chart
   shows that the U.S. is far from a high-tax country, and Democratic
   offers to raise modest amounts of revenues in the budget process would
   hardly send the nation's level of taxation through the roof.

   [31]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2003--After
   Saddam: an Arab Congo?

    The US war against Saddam may soon be over, but that may only be the
   start of the Iraq war. There are millions of guns, rockets and mortars,
   billions of rounds of ammo, scattered across the country. No one knows
    who controls them or what they have planned. The Shia want control of
   their destiny, as do the Kurds, and the Sunnis may not be happy to lose
                                   power.

   Let's say we fully control Baghdad in the next week or so and the rest
       of the cities in the next month. What Iraqi government official
      surrenders? Who runs things? Do we just slide from Saddam rule to
                               American rule?

       We have set up clear political goals, remove Saddam, establish
   democracy, but the problem is that we have no power base to work with.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       ... [122]written in 2003 by Hugo Young and reprinted earlier today.
        He was a political columnist for the Guardian from 1984 until 2003
       and biographer of Margaret Thatcher.  He wrote this piece two weeks
       before he died.
       The Labour Party was in power in Great Britain from 1997 to 2010.

                        [edwardfrascinoelsieyour.jpg]

     [123]Margaret Thatcher left a dark legacy that has still not
     disappeared
     One also can't forget what happened to the agency that made Thatcher
     world-famous: the Conservative party, of which she seemed such an
     improbable leader.  Without it, she would have been nothing. It
     chose her in a fit of desperation, hats and all - though it quite
     liked the hats.  It got over a deep, instinctive hostility to women
     at the top of anything, and put her there.  Yet her long-term effect
     seems to have been to destroy it.  The party she led three times to
     electoral triumph became unelectable for a generation.
     There are many reasons for this.  But Thatcher was a naturally,
     perhaps incurably, divisive figure. It was part of her conspicuous
     virtue, her indifference to familiar political conventions.  It came
     to a head over her most egregious policy failure, Europe.  She lost
     seven cabinet ministers on the Europe question, a record that
     permeated the party for years afterwards.  It still does.  So the
     woman I met in Curzon Street, dimpling elegantly, can now be seen in
     history with an unexpected achievement to her credit.  She wrecked
     her own party, while promoting, via many a tortuous turn, Labour's
     resurrection.

   - speaking the truth about [177]Thatcher. As for example:

     Every move she made was charged by negativity; she destroyed the
     British manufacturing industry, she hated the miners, she hated the
     arts, she hated the Irish Freedom Fighters and allowed them to die,
     she hated the English poor and did nothing at all to help them, she
     hated Greenpeace and environmental protectionists, she was the only
     European political leader who opposed a ban on the ivory trade, she
     had no wit and no warmth and even her own cabinet booted her out.
     She gave the order to blow up The Belgrano even though it was
     outside of the Malvinas Exclusion Zone--and was sailing AWAY from
     the islands! When the young Argentinean boys aboard The Belgrano had
     suffered a most appalling and unjust death, Thatcher gave the
     thumbs-up sign for the British press.

   had a pretty good profile of California Governor [354]Jerry Brown, from
   his long and circuitous route to where he is now, and how he's fixing
   California.

     Brown's age has been no impediment to his recent political progress:
     in November he won a crucial victory when Californians voted for
     higher sales taxes and staggered new taxes on the wealthy. The
     revenue the new taxes will generate, combined with deep spending
     cuts, has effectively eliminated the $27bn budget deficit Brown
     inherited from Schwarzenegger who, despite plenty of tough
     Terminator talk, failed to fix the state's perennial financial
     problems. Brown, on the other hand, has shown an iron side: the man
     known as Governor Moonbeam in the 1970s, in part because of his
     passion for satellite technology and space exploration, has balanced
     the books of a state that, until recently, was tipped by
     conservative commentators to follow Greece into financial oblivion.
     "They don't call me Moonbeam any more," he growls. "We cut pensions,
     the equivalent of social security, we cut healthcare, childcare ...
     we had a tax [ballot] and everyone said, that's not going to pass -
     and it passes! We're getting things done. We're building the
     foundation for a renewed California."

   Yeah, the cuts aren't nice, but we were facing much more drastic cuts
   to a much wider range of programs at the time, partly thanks to the
   mess Schwarzenegger left us, as well as the overall nationwide economic
   collapse from 2008.

   The investment he's doing now in high speed rail is being demonized on
   a daily basis by right-wingers, who complain it's a "boondoggle".

       Prop. 13 is still in place.  It still takes a 2/3s vote in both
       houses of the California legislature to raise any kind of taxes.
       And at the same time we voted to lower the requirement to pass a
       simple budget to a simple majority, Californians also voted to
       include fees in that 2/3s rule as well.
       :-\
       It's just that we got a supermajority in both houses this past
       November, although we lost that supermajority in the state senate
       when Michael Rubio suddenly resigned, but [385]gained it back just
       a few weeks ago with a special election to replace another state
       senator, Juan Vargas, who is now a U.S. Congressman.  There are
       still several special elections to go, and in one of them, Norma
       Torres (D) looks likely to replace Gloria Negrete McLeod (D), who
       also won a seat in Congress.  However, that opens up Torres' state
       Assembly seat for yet another special election.

 Having lived in Sweden, ([446]3+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:

       and having spent a lot of time in Denmark, I would GLADLY pay their
       tax rates. Because for what you get in return, it might just work
       out better overall for your wallet, and certainly for your peace of
       mind, especially if you believe a wealthy society like ours should
       treat all people with decency, and should take care of the less
       fortunate.
       Just for starters, here's what you get in Sweden:
       1. Efficient public transit that's pretty cheap. Many of my friends
       choose to have only one car for their family, because they can
       easily get by with only one. That saves a lot on car, insurance,
       and gasoline expenses.
       2. Cheap or free university education.
       3. Excellent K-12 public schools.
       4. Excellent, highly-subsidized child care and preschools. This
       gives every child the chance for an early start, and gives parents
       who want to work peace of mind.
       5. Six weeks paid vacation per year.
       6. 13 months or so of parental leave every time you have or adopt a
       child. This is paid on a sliding scale, and can be divided between
       the parents as they like. It can be used any time before a child is
       age 7 or so. And your employer can't get rid of your position while
       you're on leave.
       7. Solid health care with absolutely minimal co-pays (even for a
       hospital stay, you're typically liable for payment that's closer to
       $100 than the thousands we pay here, even with insurance).
       8. A strong social safety net, should you lose your job or become
       disabled.
       9. A living wage, no matter what your job is. No Wal-Mart jobs that
       pay so little that you need food stamps to survive.
       For many of us in the middle class, just what we pay for health
       insurance over a year might well add up to the differences in taxes
       that we pay vs. what the Swedes pay.

       might want to point out to a half-a-million years (or whatever)

       That being said, I do believe I will switch to something else.

 The general guideline is that if you can smash it ([493]0+ / 0-)
       With a lightweight hammer (like the back of a meat cleaver) using a
       moderate blow, a raw bone is ok. Weight-bearing bones of large
       animals like deer, cattle and pork are out (so those soup bones
       that the grocery store sells as dog bones? They'll shatter a
       dog's's teeth). Raw chicken, turkey, pork neck, etc are ok.
       A lot of people feed raw diets to their dogs. You can google "raw
       diet" or BARF (biologically appropriate raw food) for all sorts of
       info. The American Veterinary Medical Association officially does
       not support raw diets. Dogs themselves can tolerate a wide variety
       of bacteria. Their GI tract is shorter than ours and bacteria
       almost always flushes out before it can do any damage. But some
       dogs can't tolerate raw. And the AVMA is concerned about
       encouraging people to feed their pets raw meat because obviously,
       that means their kids, sick family members, etc can be exposed to
       the bacteria.
       It requires additional caution. To feed the diet exclusively, you
       have to know what you're doing.
       Soooo... Most vets won't endorse feeding raw.
       Oh, and if you see them at the store, smoked bones should also be
       considered "cooked." They're actually worse, because they're
       incredibly brittle.

       Republican filibuster abuse, is not the fact that they're abusing
       it. It's the fact that Harry Reid refuses to do anything about it.
       Can you imagine if the roles were reversed and it was Democrats who
       were abusing the filibuster and not allowing the majority
       (Republicans) to legislate?
       It would be a huge issue on Faux News and right wing AM Radio every
       single day, which also means it would become a huge issue in the
       Corporate Media.
       If Republicans ever get control of the senate, the first thing
       they'll do is nuke the filibuster. And they won't give a damn what
       anyone thinks about it.

 Tax as share of GDP needs major adjustments. ([762]0+ / 0-)

   The US makes heavy use of "Tax Expenditures" about ( 6.5% of GDP for
   Federal in 2010) for social spending.  In addition as other countrys'
   governments cover nearly all of heathcare spending while in the US
   about 9% of GDP is spent on privately paid heathcare requires further
   adjustment.

   So to reach somewhat parity in international comparisons,  major
   adjustments needs to be added to the US numbers in the above.  Other
   countries will also need adjustments.

   The Tax Policy Center ( strong Democratic pedigree as a joint Brookings
   and Urban Institute institution) has some good info on tax expenditures
   for a general audience at [763]http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/...

   Examples of social spending through tax expenditures include various
   tax subsidies for Green Energy and Ethanol, earned income tax credits,
   deductions for home mortgage interest, not taxing employer paid health
   insurance, etc..

   Providing social spending through tax expenditures artificially reduces
   reported government spending while also understating tax revenues.

   The overly simplified analysis the diary reports on mis-informs more
   than informs.

   The most important way to protect the environment is not to have more
   than one child.

   And how about that "deficit crisis," eh? What would Very Serious People

       presidency with Obamas good will progressive change would have
       happened. He spent the first 100 days pushing for progressive
       policies and it damned near cost him the Presidency. On the other
       hand Obama had the whole country wanting progressive change and he
       decided to play footsie with the Repubs.
       Get real. You're ridiculous for defending this Republican

 Hillary announced last month-- ([783]0+ / 0-)

   Yes, that's March 18, 2013-- that's she supports marriage for gay and
   lesbian couples.

   The nice thing about NOT being president is that it allows supporters
   to idealize how great a candidate would have been once they got to
   office.

   Senator Clinton was never an ultra progressive. But it's nice to
   believe she would have governed that way. It's not really based on
   evidence, but it's nice to think that.

   And for what it's worth, that Iraq war cost us trillions of dollars
   already and we'll be paying to treat broken bodies and minds for
   decades.

   Without all that totally unnecessary expenditure, President Obama would
   not be facing the financial situation he is.

   That "one transgression" has consequences. Those who voted for war in
   Iraq may not have anticipated all of them. But hey, they didn't have to
   give President Bush unlimited authority either.

   Too bad some of us weren't willing to allow them to relinquish
   responsibility as well, eh?

 Christian-American Taliban? ([792]0+ / 0-)

   Just when you think the Christofascists can't get any worse, they go
   and try to establish a "state religion" in North Carolina.

   Makes you wonder whether the bible thumpers were always this extreme,
   or are we just more cognizant of their delusional (and
   anti-constitutional) behavior nowadays thanks to the internet and
   proliferation of cable news?

   And if North Dakota, Arkansas and Kansas can get away with passing laws
   to outlaw abortion, then what's to stop the former slave states from
   passing laws to legalize slavery?

   After all, the bible condones slavery.

   The US Senate confirmed veteran prosecutor Mary Jo White to lead the
   Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, placing her in charge of
   implementing President Barack Obama's Wall Street reforms.

   With little fanfare, the Senate approved White by unanimous consent,
   after her nomination cleared the Senate Banking Committee last month by
   a 21-1 vote.

   She replaces Mary Schapiro, who resigned as chair of the nation's
   primary market in December.

 Homelessness in KC, Literally Underground ([814]0+ / 0-)

   This morning, I found [815]a photo slide show of a homeless suburb in
   Kansas City, literally underground.  It's not accompanied with any
   broader report, at that page - just photos - but I think it's a keynote
   worth remarking of. It's since been dispersed by local authorities -
   and I simply hope that the local shelters would be able to take up
   those who have been displaced with that.

   What I wish to remark of: Considering that the homeless population
   there may, in some sense, have qualities of being indigenous to the
   city, I wonder in a broader sense deriving from that, What is the
   meaning of the concept of being indigenous, in today's modern world?

   The concept of being indigenous is  a concept that I myself first heard
   addressed in such directness, by William McDonough, in his speech,
   [816]Cradle-to-Cradle Design, for Stanford's [817]Center for Social
   Innovation, in all of the social entrepreneuralism knowledge capital on
   the modern web. If it's a concept I've ever been remotely familiar with
   otherwise, I'm afraid it would sound as if I was pandering, if I denote
   that I once attended a Native American History class in City College,
   taught by a real Native American Woman. Furthermore, in having recently
   moved across a broad part of the country, I mean the US,  I had the
   opportunity to see a number of reservations, and I tried to be mindful
   of all the heritage and modern life of the same.

   How does one define the concept, Indigenous, when the concept must be
   addressed into a  modern setting, for its modern significance? Is the
   same kidn of "there to stay" point of view that McDonough represents?
   Are there any more facets to an indigenous identity?

   So, then, I wonder, in my thinking: What about "Us mutts", we who are
   of varied and distant ethnic heritage, in these generations so far
   removed from any of the multiple indigenous origins of our own
   families? Can we begin to renew a concept of being indigenous in such a
   way that it might in any way include "Us"? without taking the Brave New
   World angle, of the narrator in Huxley's famous old novel? without
   pandering?  without being radicalized, and without radicalizing the
   discussion? Can we be indgenous, can we all be indigenous, in this
   modern world? and can we not?
