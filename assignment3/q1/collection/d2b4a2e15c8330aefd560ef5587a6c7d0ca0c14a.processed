   Night Owl
   At The New Yorker, John Cassidy writes--[29]Demonizing Edward Snowden:
   Which side are you on:

   It is easy to understand, though not to approve of, why Administration
    officials, who have been embarrassed by Snowden's revelations, would
    seek to question his motives and exaggerate the damage he has done to
    national security. [Sen. Dianne] Feinstein, too, has been placed in a
       tricky spot. Tasked with overseeing the spooks and their spying
         operations, she appears to have done little more than nod.

    More unnerving is the way in which various members of the media have
    failed to challenge the official line. Nobody should be surprised to
    see the New York Post running the headline: "ROGUES' GALLERY: SNOWDEN
   JOINS LONG LIST OF NOTORIOUS, GUTLESS TRAITORS FLEEING TO RUSSIA." But
   where are Snowden's defenders? As of Monday, the editorial pages of the
    Times and the Washington Post, the two most influential papers in the
    country, hadn't even addressed the Obama Administration's decision to
    charge Snowden with two counts of violating the Espionage Act and one
                               count of theft.

    If convicted on all three counts, the former N.S.A. contract-systems
    administrator could face thirty years in jail. On the Sunday-morning
   talk shows I watched, there weren't many voices saying that would be an
   excessive punishment for someone who has performed an invaluable public
   service. And the person who did aggressively defend Snowden's actions,
    Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian blogger who was one of the reporters to
     break the story, found himself under attack. After suggesting that
    Greenwald had "aided and abetted" Snowden, David Gregory, the host of
    NBC's "Meet the Press," asked, "Why shouldn't you, Mr. Greenwald, be
                           charged with a crime?"

   After being criticized on Twitter, Gregory said that he wasn't taking a
   position on Snowden's actions--he was merely asking a question. I'm all
    for journalists asking awkward questions, too. But why aren't more of
   them being directed at Hayden and Feinstein and Obama, who are clearly
                     intent on attacking the messenger?

    To get a different perspective on Snowden and his disclosures, here's
     [30]a portion of an interview that ABC--the Australian Broadcasting
      Company, not the Disney subsidiary--did today with Thomas Drake,
       another former N.S.A. employee, who, in 2010, was charged with
      espionage for revealing details about an electronic-eavesdropping
   project called Trailblazer, a precursor to Operation Prism, one of the
     programs that Snowden documented. (The felony cases against Drake,
    [31]as my colleague Jane Mayer has written, eventually collapsed, and
                    he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.)
   INTERVIEWER: Not everybody thinks Edward Snowden did the right thing. I
                              presume you do...

   DRAKE: I consider Edward Snowden as a whistle-blower. I know some have
    called him a hero, some have called him a traitor. I focus on what he
   disclosed. I don't focus on him as a person. He had a belief that what
   he was exposed to--U.S. actions in secret--were violating human rights
    and privacy on a very, very large scale, far beyond anything that had
     been admitted to date by the government. In the public interest, he
                            made that available.

    INTERVIEWER: What do you say to the argument, advanced by those with
   the opposite viewpoint to you, especially in the U.S. Congress and the
    White House, that Edward Snowden is a traitor who made a narcissistic
        decision that he personally had a right to decide what public
                 information should be in the public domain?

        DRAKE: That's a government meme, a government cover--that's a
     government story. The government is desperate to not deal with the
      actual exposures, the content of the disclosures. Because they do
   reveal a vast, systemic, institutionalized, industrial-scale Leviathan
      surveillance state that has clearly gone far beyond the original
                 mandate to deal with terrorism--far beyond.
               As far as I'm concerned, that about covers it.

   [32]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2005--More
   Science: Do Dems Need A Reality Based Community?

   Public health officials like Ms. Ehresmann, who herself has a son with
    autism, have been trying for years to convince parents like Ms. Rupp
       that there is no link between thimerosal - a mercury-containing
         preservative once used routinely in vaccines - and autism.

                              They have failed.

      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug
         Administration, the Institute of Medicine, the World Health
    Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics have all largely
    dismissed the notion that thimerosal causes or contributes to autism.
                   Five major studies have found no link.

     Yet despite all evidence to the contrary, the number of parents who
      blame thimerosal for their children's autism has only increased.

   On today's [37]Kagro in the Morning show, Greg Dworkin joins in
   recapping the weekend on the NSA/Snowden/Greenwald/Gregory story. A
   roundup of the more remarkable #GunFAIL stories of recent days.
   Armando's SCOTUS update. Bloomberg's reporting (from February,
   actually) on the unnoticed and unofficial subsidy to "Too Big To Fail"
   banks, which just happens to be about equal in value to... their entire
   profit. Finally, another way the big banks are fleecing people: getting
   companies to pay low-wage workers with debit cards, complete with fees
   for withdrawals, etc. Why should workers get their pay for free, right?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       the best comment I've read so far regarding Snowden is that he
       should seek refuge on Wall Street, where our current panty waist AG
       will never go after him.
       Cause he gets up in the morning, And he goes to work at nine, And
       he comes back home at five-thirty, Gets the same train every time.

   This is a continuation going back to May where we've been absolutely
   flooded with new users.  I'm pretty sure almost all of these new users
   are spammers or bots.  While the rate had been getting faster, it seems
   they suddenly started slowing down right when Hurricane Sandy hit.  It
   slowed down to under 1,000 new users in a 24-hour period, and we were
   back down to somewhat over 100 new users every 24 hours or so, until
   about January 30th, when it exploded again.  What are they

       Being from Chicago, we're just happy when any of our teams actually
       win something (remember, we're the home of the Cubs, who have set a
       world record by going 104 years without a Championship/World
       Series).
       But I totally agree with you. I don't like the fact that some teams
       don't seem to mind that their team names/mascots are offensive to
       American Indians.

     Senators Say There's A 'Significant' Inaccuracy In NSA Surveillance
     Fact Sheet

     WASHINGTON -- Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Mark Udall (D-Colo.)
     called on the director of the National Security Agency to correct
     what they called a "significant" inaccuracy in a fact sheet about
     the agency's use of the law that underpins its Internet surveillance
     program.

     "In our judgment this inaccuracy is significant, as it portrays
     protections for Americans' privacy being significantly stronger than
     they actually are," Wyden and Udall wrote in a Monday letter to the
     agency's head, Gen. Keith Alexander.

     Citing the classified nature of the program, Wyden and Udall did not
     delve further into details about which part of the fact sheet they
     believe is misleading. The NSA did not immediately return a request
     for comment.

     This is not the first time Wyden has tussled with an intelligence
     leader over the NSA's surveillance programs. In March, Director of
     National Intelligence James Clapper told the senator in a public
     hearing that the agency doesn't gather information about millions of
     Americans. After the Guardian revealed the NSA does indeed collect
     records of every phone call made in the U.S., Clapper admitted that
     he had given the "least untruthful" response he could.

   Julian Assange has admitted to having at least four children, each with
   different mothers in different countries. That's been documented
   previously. After watching "We Steal Secrets" and especially where they
   interview one of his accusers in Sweden, I really think he has an
   impregnation fetish, and is consciously trying to father as many kids
   around the world as he can.

   ..and predictions
   Professor Laurence Tribe Harvard Law, teacher of both Chief justice
   Roberts & President Obama, gives his opinion along with Justice John
   Paul Stevens and their Prop 8 and DOMA  [895]predictions - by  Scottie
   Thomaston - May 17, 2013

     Tribe, a Harvard Law professor, believes the decisions in both the
     Prop 8 and DOMA cases will be narrow, but he suggested that the
     result of the Court's decisions would be that neither law will
     remain standing:

   [896]Professor Laurence Tribe @ Harvard Law School - May 08, 2013

     Two cases regarding gay marriage, Hollingsworth v. Perry
     (challenging California's Proposition 8) and United States v.
     Windsor (challenging the Defense of Marriage Act), were argued this
     term in front of the Supreme Court. The Justices are expected to
     reach a ruling by July 2013.
     [...]
     DOMA
     Regarding the pair of cases currently pending in the Supreme Court,
     my hunch - and it is only that - is that the Court will narrowly
     conclude that the DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act] issue is properly
     before SCOTUS on the merits notwithstanding the solid reasons to
     doubt that BLAG [Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House
     of Representatives] is a proper representative of Congress and that
     the Court will hold DOMA's Sec. 3 unconstitutional by a vote of 5-4,
     with Justice Kennedy relying heavily on the kinds of federalism
     considerations that Judge Boudin found persuasive in CA1 [U.S. Court
     of Appeals for the First Circuit] but with the more liberal four
     justices relying squarely on the equality component of fifth
     amendment due process.
     [...]
     Prop 8
     As to Hollingsworth, however, I doubt that the Court will conclude
     that Chuck Cooper and the other private proponents of Prop 8, all
     lacking a fiduciary duty to California, have Art. III standing to
     defend it on the merits in the Supreme Court (despite what the
     state's highest court concluded) and will dismiss that case on
     standing grounds, leaving in place Judge Walker's statewide
     injunction against Prop 8 but setting no nationwide precedent.
     Alternatively, despite the Rule of Four, I wouldn't be too surprised
     to see the Court dismiss cert as improvidently granted, leaving
     CA9's [[897]U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit] decision in
     place but again setting no nationwide precedent.

   ......................................................

   About Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.
    I've noticed some opinions voiced lately that if the Roberts court
   strikes down DOMA and rules against the proponents of Prop 8 as not
   having standing and therefore CA9 decision in place, it buys Roberts
   political space to appease the RWNJ's and  gut Section 5 of the VRA -
   as he has argued with his "elephant whistle" argument

     In the oral argument in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District
     No. One v. Holder7 (NAMUDNO), Chief Justice John Roberts described
     this problem as "the Elephant Whistle problem." To summarize the
     allegory:

     A guy with a whistle around his neck walks into a bar. Another guy
     asks him, "Why are you wearing a whistle around your neck?" "It's to
     keep away elephants," the first responds. "How do you know it's
     working?" the second asks. "Do you see any elephants around here?"

     If the Court takes the elephant whistle problem seriously, the
     challenge for defenders of the VRA is to find a metric that can hint
     at the danger of the VRA's removal while simultaneously not
     suggesting it either has been ineffective or has outlived its
     usefulness..
     -    Emphasis added

   But this article from  [898]Harvard Law Review has a different take - a
   promising one imo because it carefully details and implements exactly
   the metric needed to prove the danger of gutting Section 5

   Regional Differences in Racial Polarization in the 2012 Election:
   Implications for the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting
   Rights Act

   The Harvard Law review.s conclusion:

     Reasonable people can disagree about the relevance of the 2012
     election or even racially polarized voting patterns to the
     constitutionality of the coverage formula for section 5 of the
     Voting Rights Act. Indeed, we view our findings more as a response
     to the notion that the election and reelection of an African
     American President settles the constitutional question in favor of
     the VRA's detractors. If anything, the opposite is true. To be sure,
     the coverage formula does not capture every racially polarized
     jurisdiction, nor does every county covered by section 5 outrank
     every noncovered county on this score. However, the stark race-based
     differences in voting patterns between the covered and noncovered
     jurisdictions taken as a whole demonstrate the coverage formula's
     continuing relevance.

     In particular, for those looking for a way to distinguish the
     covered jurisdictions from the noncovered jurisdictions, and to do
     so without running afoul of the "elephant whistle" problem,
     differential rates of racially polarized voting provide an ideal
     metric. There can be no doubt that the covered jurisdictions differ,
     as a group, from the noncovered jurisdictions in their rates of
     racially polarized voting. There can also be no doubt that voting in
     the covered jurisdictions as a whole is becoming more, not less,
     polarized over time.

   The study carefully documents that existing racial polarization has
   increased over time in some areas not lessened. So Section 5 of the VRA
   is constitutional and justified.

   But will Roberts care? [899]Professor Laurence Tribe got it right about
   Roberts on the PPACA individual Mandate.

   P.S.:The Harvard Law  Review article is not Professor Tribe's stated
   opinion but I sure hope it is how Roberts court rules on all three -
   since Affirmative Action wasn't a complete gutting today maybe there is
   hope

   things about Snowden, and others have been saying good things about
   him. And all that is great. The problem is that there are some people
   here who are getting overly emotional about the whole thing, and
   terribly angry at commenters on the other side of the issue. The
   important thing we all need to remember is that we are here to have fun
   chit-chatting with others. Edward Snowden's life is going to unfold
   however it is going to unfold, and whatever we say here does not and
   will not actually affect him or his future one iota. People here need
   to remember that. We're talking, but there is no real-world impact from
   our discussion, and so there is no reason to get bent out of shape
   because somebody says Snowden should be hanged or someone says that
   Snowden should get pardoned and the Nobel Peace Prize.

       Some seem to argue that there's nothing to do on policy, because
       it's old news and what's being collected is not a big deal. Some
       seem to argue that the current policy is a good thing, it's keeping
       us safe, and this guy is jeopardizing our safety. Some seem to
       argue that these disclosures require us to work to eliminate the
       Patriot Act, rein in FISA, etc.
       Thus, the fundamental difference on this issue appears to be
       regarding whether or not a policy change needs to be made at all.

       another thing that I raised to several people I talked to at
       Netroots Nation, that most of these reporters do NOT understand
       what data mining is, and what it can and cannot do.  That then gets
       amplified by bloggers and pundits on both sides, who then
       extrapolate from a misunderstanding of what it is, and assume
       things that only exist in science fiction.
       And the problem is it's hard to explain what took me years to learn
       to someone who does not have an advanced degree in statistics
       and/or computer science in 30 seconds or less.
       And with the yottabytes of data they've collected of the metadata,
       it actually becomes a hindrance, because they're sorting through
       too much noise, to where it actually becomes a drain on NSA
       resources.

   I know that you are not required to take a science course to get a
   degree in journalism, but couldn't they at least contact someone to
   explain things to them?

   I hate the way that journalists construct an imaginary box and say that
   things in the box are my job and things outside of it are not. It is a
   totally arbitrary line that only they control.

   For example, CBS Evening News ran two stories in the 1980's about the
   [1116]energy machine of Joseph Newman. I saw that story and immediately
   noticed that Newman was claiming that he could break several laws of
   physics simultaneously.

   When Robert L. Park was researching his book, [1117]Voodoo Science, he
   contacted CBS and asked them why they were putting such obvious
   nonsense on the air.

   CBS replied, "You don't understand. That was a human interest story. We
   don't have to check any facts in a human interest story."

   The two words, "human interest" put fact checking outside of the box.

 My opinion on Snowden ([1127]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1128]indie17

   If Snowden did indeed "empty out his laptop" (or copy state secrets to
   a flash drive) for the Chinese government, that was a really bad thing
   to do. They are not our friends, and when I say "our", I'm talking
   about you and me, not the US government, Wall Street, etc. Plus,
   Snowden would have broken a written agreement he made about disclosure.

   I'm perfectly OK with letting the Justice Dept., the State Dept., and
   the court system do their jobs. If Snowden gets extradited, he gets his
   day in court, a jury weighs the evidence, and decides his guilt or
   innocence.

   But, of course, what the NSA has been doing is a much larger issue, and
   I hope that the 2014 election results in a saner and more civil
   liberties-friendly Congress. As a very long-time fiscal conservative, I
   say, does the NSA really need 20,000 employees? Wouldn't 19,000 be
   enough? Or 15,000? And does the Goverment really need 17 different
   intelligence agencies? Wouldn't ten be enough? Aren't we supposed to be
   concerned about the deficit? And couldn't the money spent on all the
   stuff be better spent on high-speed rail, replacing highway bridges, or
   food stamps?

   built one. On the basis of nothing other than the fact he was Chinese,
   Dr. Lee was identified as a suspect, and put into solitary confinement.

   The Left went berserk. How can you deny this man his constitutional
   rights to due process, yadda, yadda, yadda. The whole discussion became

   do about yourself! Once Snowden's situation is resolved, we'll think
   the issue is resolved, and nothing will change.

       expose a horribly unconstitutional domestic surveillance program to
       the American people, which I applaud him for.  And by the way, even

     Snowden took classified documents from his employer, which surely
     broke the law. But his real crime was confirming that the
     intelligence agencies, despite their strenuous public denials, have
     been accumulating vast amounts of personal data from the American
     public. The puzzle is why so many media commentators continue to toe
     the official line. About the best explanation I've seen came from
     Josh Marshall, the founder of T.P.M., who has been one of Snowden's
     critics. In a post that followed the first wave of stories, Marshall
     wrote, "At the end of the day, for all its faults, the U.S. military
     is the armed force of a political community I identify with and a
     government I support. I'm not a bystander to it. I'm implicated in
     what it does and I feel I have a responsibility and a right to a
     say, albeit just a minuscule one, in what it does."

       On the trainwreck known as Meet the Press,we had Mike Murphy
       belittling Snowden and the NSA over reach.Yet,lookee here. How not
       shocking....

     But Murphy himself has a stake in this debate that arguably ought to
     have been disclosed. Though Murphy was introduced only as a
     "Republican strategist," he is also the founding partner of
     Navigators Global, a lobbying firm that represents one of the NSA's
     largest contractors. Disclosures show that Navigators Global
     represents Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) on issues before Congress.
     For at least a decade, CSC has won major contracts from the National
     Security Agency (NSA). Murphy's firm has lobbied on behalf of CSC
     for bills that would expand the NSA's reach, including the Cyber
     Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act or CISPA, which passed the
     House of Representatives earlier this year. As the Center for
     Democracy and Technology noted, the "legislation is being billed as
     an expansion of a collaboration between the National Security Agency
     (NSA) and major ISPs dubbed the Defense Industrial Base Pilot."

   Recommended by:

   and it's a puzzle to me why anyone would be puzzled by it.

   We live in a media world of info-tainment fluff, a market-driven
   paradise for neo-liberals.  This is the sad result of allowing news to
   become entirely profit-driven.  The market is saturated with
   tabloid-style sensationalism, plugs for celebs and pop stars and
   reality TV, and "reports" on the vapid actions of celebs and pop stars
   and reality TV figures.

   And the "serious" news has come to treat its subjects in the same
   manner.  Pay to play, baby.  Exchange gauzy coverage for access.  Embed
   yourself as uncritically as possible in the machine.

   It's a sign of how pathetic journalism has become when you have Gregory
   launching diatribes on an investigative journalist for, you know,
   investigating.  And as you cite here, Josh Marshall pledging some sort
   of obsequious fidelity to all actions of the US military due to being
   American.

   When the media has become coterminous with the mechanism of power, it
   ceases to serve its intended function.

   And the public ceases to take it seriously as anything other than one
   more empty distraction.

   I've lived long enough to understand the concept of the word, "hero."
   Perhaps that should be the discussion rather than the poor
   victimization of someone who has the resources to globe-trot.

   The problem with how Snowden is covered here has more to do with
   demonization of the United States and Democrats.  Claims and
   accusations of Snowden's defenders and Wikileaks supporters are
   trumpeted here repeatedly as fact.

   Reasoned criticism of American Government policy and actions is not
   only appropriate but necessary to our democracy.  But now the Snowden
   camp wants people to support the idea:

   - the US is a police state
   - the US justice system cannot provide a fair trial
   - human rights and civil liberties in America are mocked

   If you are wondering where this vision comes from, recall that Snowden
   donated to Ron Paul for President in 2012.

   Around election time, traditionally Democrats and progressives make a
   consistent argument that:

   1) government is a tool for doing good
   2) Democrats can be trusted more than the GOP to look out for the
   interests of everyone, not just privileged

   The Snowden camp undermines this argument.  Their consistent viewpoint
   is that government is inherently corrupt and authoritarian and there is
   little choice between the two parties.  Their other hero - journalist
   Glen Greenwald - is a poster for this mindset - he lives abroad and
   doesn't even bother to vote.

   Yes, let's drive down Democratic turnout in 2014 and beyond by claiming
   the parties are the same and that voting doesn't matter.  Amazing this
   is the spirit that has seized the limelight here.

       If you believe the USA is a Fascist State, you do not understand
       what fascism is.
       The sad thing about all this is how some of the Marquee names on
       DKOS - people who have written some good solid pieces over the
       years - have jumped aboard the Snowden bandwagon.
       Easier to join the crowd than to take a stand against it.  But in
       their desire for approval from people who think the USA is a
       "Fascist State" they will lose a lot of readers.

 Well, I was of the understanding that fascism is ([1717]0+ / 0-)

   defined essentially as the merging of the government with corporate
   power, at least by the Mussolini model.  In which case we are certainly
   getting there.

   And also, it is now the federal government's policy for the Executive
   to create kill lists of US citizens, and then either assassinate them
   or imprison them indefinitely with no access to trial, all the while
   classifying their grounds for such actions as "Classified" and secret.
    Is this power used widely? No. But the President reserves the "right"
   to use it at his discretion.

   We are indeed creeping towards fascism. Not there yet, but certainly on
   the way.

   for "their country" (which isn't "theirs" any more than the basketball
   team is).

   To them of course Snowden is a "traitor" . . . he told America (and the
   world) what is being done to it.  A part of what's being done, anyway .
   . . there's no mention of the corrupt and manipulated "financial
   system" in Snowden's disclosures, and most important

   no mention of who's doing it, and why.  That discussion goes far beyond
   the simple facts that Snowden has disclosed.

   If anything, the opposite is true. We've got a very specific few users,
   and yes, I could name them if I wanted to call them out, who go into
   every diary trying to talk about the ISSUES, and threadjack those
   diaries, REPEATEDLY, by MAKING IT ABOUT SNOWDEN.

   Most of the pie centers around people WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR
   RIGHTS having to CONTINUOUSLY explain OVER and OVER again why all the
   Snowden slander crap is NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS.

   And these so-called "pro-snowden" people are being forced into
   correcting willfully-repeated factual inaccuracies OVER and OVER and
   OVER again.

   And it's frying people's patience. BIG TIME.

   So stop with this projection/marginalization bullshit already.

 There's more than one thing at issue here ([1872]0+ / 0-)

   Whats interesting here is how many people cry YOU MUST DISCUSS THIS
   PART OF THE SITUATION! ITS THE ONLY ONE!!

   I think there's the issue of the NSA Spying (?) That's well worth
   discussing.
   Then there's the issue of a HUGE national Security breach. Thats also
   well worth discussion.

   I'll be honest: I always assumed the government had the capability to
   spy on anyone and everyone and would do so whenever the human beings at
   the top of the government wanted to do so. (I read Orwell too) That
   concept doesn't change, only the technology improves.
   So my first response is: See, I wasn't paranoid after all
   That does not in any sense mean I approve of it, just that I accepted
   it as fact long ago so its not a screaming OMG! moment for me like many
   here. I'm on the side of the ones who say it shouldn't be happening. So
   I don't argue that with them.

   Then there's the important issue of  a government contractor (Booz
   Allen) hiring a completely uneducated, untrained and inexperienced
   person like Snowden and giving him access to our nations secrets.
   The jury's still out on Snowden as far as I'm concerned but I sure do
   want heads to roll at Booz Allen.  I want their whole hiring process
   and contracting process looked into. If theyir handling of important
   government information is this casual thev should be denied further
   government contracts
   I think Snowden and his motives should be looked into because I don't
   think any one should get a free pass on anything.

   I think the enormous breach of security here is as important as the
   information revealed. I think all facets of this issue should be looked
   at.

   Recommended by:

   manifesto of everything they believe in and we all know that if Snowden
   contributed to Ron Paul in 2012 everything he said should be ignored.
   Maybe it had something to do with what he knew about what was really
   happening internationally and he saw a token vote for the proverbial
   stopped clock's opinion.

   Check this out, who cares if he contributed to Bugs Bunny in 2012 but
   it is obvious that people that find that important would like it to be
   the discussion not what he revealed and don't happen to like the truth
   they hear.In my opinion it just shows how poor our choices are.

     The Snowden camp undermines this argument.  Their consistent
     viewpoint is that government is inherently corrupt and authoritarian
     and there is little choice between the two parties.  Their other
     hero - journalist Glen Greenwald - is a poster for this mindset - he
     lives abroad and doesn't even bother to vote.

   Pure attempt at distraction , first who is "their" you are talking
   about? do you have any quotes to support anything you said? none of
   what you say about the messenger (Glenn Greenwald , it has 2 'n's' do
   you even know whom you're talking about? plus he isn't a "poster") has
   anything to do with what was revealed and you definitely are either
   lying or just throwing it out there that GG doesn't vote here (again
   not that that should matter but that's how these red herring things
   go).

   Fwiw it is worth he DOES vote in the USA and it is something that is

 Just because there is a difference... ([1886]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1887]KJG52

   Does not mean that difference is as large as it should be. I want
   Democrats to be the good guys. I want them to be people I want to vote
   for. All too often, being better than the Republicans these days means
   holding what used to be mainstream Republican values, instead of the
   proto-fascism of the modern Republican party.

     - the US is a police state
     - the US justice system cannot provide a fair trial
     - human rights and civil liberties in America are mocked

   Bradley Manning spent 3 years in solitary confinement waiting for a
   trial when the UCMJ sets a one year maximum. The better part of the
   first year, he was held in conditions that we call torture when other
   countries do it to our people.

   Nationwide domestic intelligence operations against peaceful protestors
   against the war in Irag and Afghanistan increased under President
   Obama.

   The Obama Justice Department coordinated the crackdown on the Occupy
   movement, with excessive force documented in almost every case where
   the Feds were involved.

   Banks that engaged in mortgage fraud that cost the taxpayers billions
   of dollars walk scot-free, whilst the Obama Justice Department throws
   the books at Anonymous hackers who expose the crimes of the banksters.

   The difference is that Obama has slowed our march to fascism. I had
   been hoping he would reverse it. I'm tired of only having a choice
   between a Republican who wants to charge straight down hill into
   fascism, and a Democrat who will instead take the slow, scenic route. I
   would rather vote for an actual liberal Democrat who will work to
   rebuild our economy so it works for all of us, our laws so they are
   fair for all, our courts so they are just for all,

   Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your
   shackles. It is by the picket line and direct action that true freedom
   will be won, not by electing people who promise to screw us less than
   the other guy.

   i so much miss my weekly New Yorker.

       The Obama Administration doesn't want him to come home and
     contribute to the national-security-versus-liberty debate that the
     President says is necessary. It wants to lock him up for a long
     time.

     And for what? For telling would-be jihadis that we are monitoring
     their Gmail and Facebook accounts? For informing the Chinese that we
     eavesdrop on many of their important institutions, including their
     prestigious research universities? For confirming that the Brits
     eavesdrop on virtually anybody they feel like? Come on. Are there
     many people out there who didn't already know these things?

     Snowden took classified documents from his employer, which surely
     broke the law. But his real crime was confirming that the
     intelligence agencies, despite their strenuous public denials, have
     been accumulating vast amounts of personal data from the American
     public.

   was classic hegemonic misdirection,  I'm just as uninterested in
   reading a personal defense of Snowden than I am on the organized
   hit-job crossing many branches of politics and government being carried
   out.  (Though I AM interested in that hit job abstracted from the
   individual, its character and mechanics are quite revealing as to the
   scope and presence of Hegemony and Empire.)

   The fact that all the headlines are about Snowden, and the program's
   "defenders" are able to get away with what would have been widely
   denounced (by them!) as conspiracy theory just a few weeks ago, shows
   what a spectacular success this shooting of the messenger has been for
   the rulers.  Now suddenly there's something wrong with you if you DON'T
   believe that government is and should be at all times monitoring all of
   your communications.  Sounds like the kind of stuff Edscan used to say
   that got him ridiculed and marginalized by the very people that today
   make that argument daily to fend off any progressive criticism.

   to hop on a plane to Russia and Cuba to demonstrate their love of
   freedom. The truth is that revealing sensitive government information,
   even information that reveals things that people should probably know,
   comes at a great price for our nation. We deserve as a democratic
   people to use our justice system to judge if such people are in fact
   doing us a favor or acting selfishly. So far, Snowden has declared
   himself above the rule of law, so I can't say that I think that his

       than his word to Ellsberg.  And then Ellsberg took it on the lam,
       too.
       Snowden has acted more sensibly and more honorably than either.
       It ain't called paranoia - when they're really out to get you. 6

       wouldn't be only Middle Easterners or Iranians or Arabs or Muslims

       Brad Friedman or Snowden. Such as me and, I presume, you. And they
       know that because, all right, we're saying it on public radio, but
       supposing we hadn't. There's a lot of people who don't have the
       access here to the public but they do talk to their friends on the

       or I. "

   Snowden to the woodshed really surprises me.  And it is more than a
   little disappointing.

   The tribalism inherent in the reactions to Snowden's revelations is
   depressing.  The guy is a whistle blower.  The NSA program is a
   monstrous overreach.  That it negatively impacts the president is no
   reason to shit on this guy, like many here have.

   democrats who hold to a certain set of principles and rights, and who
   measure politicians by whether their policies conform to those things.
    On the other hand, there are monarchialists that stand for

   and it just tastes better - no preservatives. These are an Americanized
   "French" bread, meaning a softer texture. My roommate likes really soft
   white bread, yuck! But if I make it from scratch I can get a much
   better taste and texture. Anyway, thanks for indulging my being a bit

       Popular. My sourdough wheat is fine too, but the various grains
       give it a nice texture.
       My husband doesn't like sourdough, so I make him a variety of whole
       grain French bread. (And that's why I give so much away. I bake
       numerous times a week, but you can only eat so much bread, eh?)

   was out $60.

   A woman who parks her bike there often and had a bike stolen there, and
   she had lots of gear ripped off there warned me about how bad that spot
   is and how there was a single security camera pointed away from yhe
   convention center's bike rack. I reported it to the convention center

   You can't really pretend the New York Post is "journalism" can you?

   How much demonizing is going on in legitimate journals, vs just talking
   about how Snowden the man actually is a pretty big douchebag.

   And you can't really blame so-called "moderates" for not jumping in
   line to defend Snowden. He's a Ron Paul guy, and he ran into the arms
   of Putin with national security info. And he planned it from the
   beginning ala James O'Keefe.

   I have no agenda in the matter, as the gov't might - if anything I'm
   for whistleblowing in many cases. But a douchebag is still a douchebag.

   And a lot of folks just aren't going to have a fit defending a
   douchebag libertarian. If they want to have fits over people and
   whether they should avoid facing the law as it's written, it'd probably
   be for a lot of other people first.

   Like the author said, there's who he is (which is a libertarian), and
   then there's what he disclosed. I can discern the difference, and still
   think Snowden is a white libertarian self-entitled puke of pondscum who
   did what he did for many of the wrong reasons and definitely in the
   wrong way (again, Putin? Really?).

   Plenty of kids in prison doing 20 or more for minimum sentencing drug
   laws. Snowden and white libertarians like him can have a taste and it
   won't bother me all that much.

   Justice for everyone, and then justice for white libertarians. I'm
   tired of them jumping ahead in line.

   that the US security apparatus wants this "scope and methods" info

   it in their calculations

   I just feel strongly that the "truth" that the USG wants out there is
   out there, and the Truth that it does not want out there is still not
   out there.

   Snowden and his outraged supporters may be doing America a huge favor,
   not the one they think though.

   Many approach the issue with the following assumptions:

   That whatever info Snowden releases is:
   1. All True
   2. The whole truth, or enough information to understand all of what is
   truly happening.
   3. Info the NSA/USG did not/does not want "found out"/made public.

       Generally good service here. Waiting 2 hours so far. After net
       surfing to pass the time, now I have to preserve phone battery.

 There will be much more to learn re: Snowdon ([2591]0+ / 0-)

   The hints are appearing. He didn't work on the job THEN discover what
   he thought was wrong. He deliberately sought the job to do this
   "expose." And he didn't come to it out of a deep and prescient sense of
   political right and wrong. I will not be surprised if it turns out he
   was recruited and hired to do it. By whom?

   That all just distracts from the real issue of privacy in the Twenty
   First Century. And knowing the Rovian sense of twisted logic, I
   wouldn't be surprised if this distraction wasn't exactly what the
   recruiters wanted to happen. Meanwhile, I'll bet my husband was
   searching for some special toothpaste on his computer late last night.
   I can see the ads for it here!

 Thank You MB, bringing the article and issue to... ([2594]0+ / 0-)

   DK, IMHO it is imperative that we divorce facts from conjecture and
   focus on what is being done by USG, not the  ridiculous speculation
   about Snowden's motives or the wild charges that he is a
   Chinese/Russian spy, or his Libertarianism, or the color of his
   girlfriend's costumes or the other banal "Where's Waldo," rumor
   mongering and character assassination that is the typical Villager
   smokescreen that arises when anyone in Washington gets caught lying to
   the American public.

   When John Kerry and Rand Paul are on the same page, the hair on the
   back of my neck starts standing up.

 Criticize the media now? It's Hillary they want ([2597]0+ / 0-)

   When in the last month have you heard the word IRS without the word
   "scandal" after it. "IRS SCANDAL" is a media buzz phrase. And yet, to
   date, there has been absolutely no scandal identified.

   Low information voters get the words permanently associated in their
   minds, and two months from now when ISSA moves on to something else,
   the words are still bound together never the both shall part. That's
   very deliberate, and even occurs on MSNBC as they report on others'
   reporting.

   I've already posted today about the gross negligence of media in
   actually investigating what the Snowden mess is doing. Undermining a
   relatively good foreign relations record of Obama's, just in time for
   Hillary to try to run on it!

   PLEASE don't' underestimate them. I'd firmly bet this is a 12
   dimensional chess game aimed at the Clinton candidacy.

 The Big Tell; over-use of the word "narcissistic." ([2600]0+ / 0-)

   That's not a word that your average Joe uses every day, yet it seems to
   be conveniently on the lips of all of Snowden's detractors as they
   blather soullessly into the camera.  It's almost like that word is the
   fingerprints left by their marching orders.

   Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!

 a whistle blower does not flee ([2610]0+ / 0-)

   He purposely took the job to do this, that is not whistle blowing. Best
   punishment.. don't let him back into this great Democracy. Let him rot
   in one of those countries who truly have no civil liberties. Of course
   he is a very hot potato that no country wants.
