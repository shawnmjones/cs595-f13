Once every season, George R. R. Martin takes up his pen to script an episode of the series based on his books. Martin's an extremely talented, and very experienced, screenwriter having helmed <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> (the good one, not the new one) as well as turning in multiple scripts for the revivals of the <i>Twilight Zone</i> and <i>Outer Limits</i>. His episodes of <i>A Game of Thrones</i> have always been among the meatiest. In the first season, he delivered <i>The Pointy End</i> in which the betrayal of Eddard is revealed and Robb starts along the road to war. Last year he penned the absolutely marvelous <i>Blackwater</i>, which provided the action climax of the season and gave us moments that still act as pivot-points for the series. Not only did these scripts move the plot miles down field, they also provided some of the best moments for the characters and a decided lack of sex and gore for sex and gore's sake.
<p>This year, Martin's contribution is <i>The Bear and the Maiden Fair</i>. Does it live up to the previous offerings? &nbsp;Uhhh ... nope. In fact, far from providing the most action/plot/character building episode of the year, what this episode does is kind of paddle in place.</p>
<p>Come on in, let's hash it out anyway.</p>

		</div>
		
		
			<p class="divider-doodle" />
		
		
			<div id="body" class="article-body">
<p>Not so far up north as before they scaled the wall, Jon Snow and the wildlings are walking among actual trees. &nbsp;Ygritte charmingly mistakes a windmill for a castle and Jon teases her about the wonders of Winterfell. He'd probably be boasting a bit less if he'd been home lately. It's Ygritte's turn to laugh when Jon has to explain to her the delicate sensibilities of some women, though I'm not sure we seen many examples of swoon-ish women in Game of Thrones. Maybe Sansa (poor Sansa). Hawk whisperer Orell declares his loves to Ygritte and his hate to Jon. Then goes on to plant seeds of doubt in Ygritte's mind about Jon Snow's ability to ever really be anything but the straightest of straight arrows.</p>
<p>Next up, Robb Stark takes a rain delay. Literally. Robb and Talisa roll around their well-appointed traveling bed while half the Stark company complains of the rain and the other half repeat eleventeen variations on "Walder Frey is already mad as hell, and he's not going to like us being late." Nice as it is to see that Robb and Talisa genuinely care for each other, most of the scene accomplishes little but to keep Talisa's bare backside maximally exposed for a lengthy period before revealing that Robb's new wife has a wolf pup in the oven (ick, sorry for the badly mixed metaphor). The scene does remind you that Robb is perhaps the nicest guy left on the playing field, but honestly this late in the season a lengthy "let's pause here because the roads are wet" scene just feels like deliberate stalling.</p>
<p>And down to King's Landing to see Sansa. Poor future Lady Lannister. Sansa sighs over her childhood dreams (from just two seasons ago) in which she couldn't wait to see all the beautiful knights and ladies of the capital. Surprise! Margaery does a good job of offering a comforting shoulder. In fact, Margaery's praise of Tyrion is so fullsome it makes you wonder if the queen-to-be wouldn't rather wed a different Lannister. And Margaery is right. Tyrion is by far the most attractive of the golden horde, mostly because he comes with actual motivations beyond "what's in it for me" and combines a sharp mind and a tender heart. Though I'm not too sure of Margaery's declaration that in marrying Tyrion, Sansa will become the lady of Casterly Rock. Papa Tywin has already indicated that Tyrion's chances of getting the ancestral home are slim and none. In any case, marry him, Sansa, go off to someplace away from the fighting and talk to the man. Loras' curly hair isn't everything.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, husband to be Tyrion is feeling more than a little embarrassed, not to say squeamish, about bedding a child (book Sansa is still short of her 15th birthday, though TV Sansa is... taller). Besides, Tyrion is genuinely in love with the spicy Shae. Convincing Shae to stick around while Tyrion marries the little auburn-haired beauty isn't going to be easy. And probably shouldn't be. Still, Tyrion is putting a big effort into keeping Shae content, even if that does mean he puts his foot in his mouth more than once.</p>
<p>Completing our King's Landing tour, we see Joffery summoning Granpa Tywin into the throne room. Having recently given a smack-down to his mother (and aunt) Cersei, Joffery is feeling his oats as he demands more involvement in running the realm. But, as we've seen several times, Tywin suffers no fools. Not gladly. Not at all. Within thirty seconds, you can see the boy king wondering just why he ever asked to see his Hand. Tywin eventually tells Joffery that he will tell him everything that Tywin thinks he needs to know and solicit his advice on everything that doesn't matter. In other words, nothing changes. Tywin runs the kingdom, Joffery gets to sit on his uncomfortable chair. And kill the occasional ex-prostitute. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We leave King's Landing without every seeing Cersei, which may be a first, and without ever getting to see what kind of dialog Martin could provide to Dame Diana Hepburn Eleanor Queen of Thorns Rigg, which is a shame.</p>
<p>Cross the ocean, Daenerys pulls up at the next slave city, Yunkai, and gives the slave owners of this rather large city the kind of ultimatum that's designed to generate a good deal of friction. The Yunkai try to buy the mother of dragons off. It doesn't work. So more war is a'coming. For those who are waiting for Dany to charge on over to Westeros and put Joffery's head on a (dragon-roasted) spit, this episode is more than a bit disappointing. Having freed the Unsullied, Dany has apparently decided that on her way to the Iron Throne she might as well save a city, or two, or... One thing about this scene: the dragons look fabulous. I mean, gorgeous in both movement and detail. All those little frills and spines. I loves me some beasties. It's no wonder everyone wants one. Still, I agree with Jorah -- taking this place won't get us any closer to Westeros. Move, girl, move!</p>
<p>In a brief shipboard interlude, Melisandre informs Gendry of his royal-bastardhood as they sail past King's Landing. I suppose we had to make this point clear (and for book readers this confirms that Gendry has taken on the role formerly held by Sir Not Appearing In This Series, Edric Storm), but how did we end up sailing down the Blackwater? Weren't we in the Riverlands last week? Is this really the fastest route back to Dragonstone? And don't the Lannisters keep at least a nominal watch over the river that, not so long ago, an attacking navy swarmed down to attack the city? Hmmm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Arya is pissed. Good for Arya. I love Arya. Did you know that Arya is trending as one of the most popular names for girls? Just wait till those kids are in grade school. Anyway, the Brotherhood blames their jerkwad treatment of Gendry on the Red God. Asked who she worships, Arya answers simply "death." Did I mention I love Arya? No sixth grader on the planet can deliver this line with such patent menace. When Arya makes a break for it, she's snatched out of the woods by the guy at the top of her hate list, The Hound. See you next week, Arya.</p>
<p>One thing I really did not expect from Martin was a Theon torture interval. In the book, all the torture is off screen. But here it is again. On screen. &nbsp;And just as pointless as every other Theon torture scene. Moving on.</p>
<p>Up north again when Bran get's his dreams explained by fellow dream-afflicted Jojen. Osha takes this opportunity to tell a scary story (actually it is pretty scary) about the wight encounter that got her moving south. Which explains a good deal of Osha's concerns about how they keep moving north.</p>
<p>And finally I've saved the back and forth of Jaime and Brienne scenes for one end-of-the-recap lump. Having been marched out of the castle without his big protector, one-handed Jaime insists that they march back by threatening to lie about how he lost his hand. He then threatens to lie some more. Which, if I was guarding Jaime, would make me think there's a good chance he's going to lie no matter what. But they do march back and find Brienne fending off a very (very) big bear with a wooden sword. A BIG bear. Jaime rushes to her aid and both escape the bear pit just ahead of large slavering jaws. Even so, the scene comes off as much shorter and less tense than it did in the book. As the centerpiece of the episode, it falls a little flat. However, this isn't a CGI bear, and I suppose there are only so many times you can wave pointy sticks its way and put tasty actors in its beary grip before it gets that "screw the bear chow, I'm having Danish" idea.</p>
<p>So there you have it. A lot happened, but not many story lines really advanced. What's your take?</p>

		<p><b>More Tagging tips:</b></p>
		<p>A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?</p>
		<p>Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.</p>
		<p>If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. 
		CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.</p>
		<p>Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful.</p>

		<!-- <input id="tagSubmit" type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" /> -->
	</p>

	
	
	<p style="font-style:italic">Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary:

	If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state 
	(<a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('California');return false;">California</a>,
	<a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Texas');return false;">Texas</a>, etc).
	Keep in mind, though, that there are many wonderful and important diaries
	that don't fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

<p>But I come from an old New Orleans family that actually still had a wad of Confederate money stashed away when I was a kid. &nbsp;And, sure enough, some of the ten-spots (all sorts of banks were issuing money, so every denomination came in multiple versions from multiple banks) had that "Dix" instead of, or in addition to, "Ten", that we get Dixie from. &nbsp;The Old Confederacy was actually part-way bilingual, at least as far as banking was concerned, at least until it lost all those francophone bankers when Farragut took New Orleans in 1862.</p>
<p>That would be one clear difference between that Confederacy and the neo-Confederacy we might end up seeing rise again. &nbsp;No way will the neo-Confederacy be bilingual.</p>

<p>C'mon, it was obvious.</p>
<p>Also caught on the new Stark baby coming, long before Robb did.</p>
<p>But a Dany scene was coming later in the plot, and although I also guessed she'd want to free these slaves, too -- dragons!</p>

<p>and as I read the books, I saw mini treatises on all aspects of war.... "broken men" and ptsd. &nbsp;Torture and how pointless it is as a tool for anything but masochism. &nbsp;The scene in the barn with Arya and The Tickler really nails this subject in the books. &nbsp;The role of superior overwhelming technology in war. &nbsp;The plight of displaced people during conflicts and how it changes good people.... how it changes everyone. &nbsp;The use of starvation and rape as tools for subjugating a population. &nbsp;The clash of different religions and how that is used as a cloak for justifying a straight up war for control of resources and power. &nbsp;Disaster capitalism..... &nbsp;I love these books but for how they explain US and our wars, today.</p>

<p>she needs time for the Dragons to grow bigger and stronger, and furthermore, she needs those 200,000 slaves.... to swell her army to overwhelming proportions ..... Daenerys Stormborn is a pure strategist.</p>
<p>Having said all that, my larger point is, I have to completely disagree with this diarists take on this episode. I loved it.</p>
<p>To the diarist:</p>
<p>If you knew that George R. R. Martin's first love is writing dramatic historical fiction, you would realize that his choice genre is born of striving for a painstakingly meticulous realism, and realism requires detail and slow paced pieces of a delicate long term storm. A storm that builds into a storm. The revealing "Melisandre informs Gendry of his royal-bastardhood" was huge to that persona and his character development. And the finale, of Jamie jumping into a bit of almost sure death to save Brie, that too was huge in term of revealing the dramatic change in Jamie's character, which is paramount to his characters transformation into a character that we admire.... and rewind a few minutes, to where he reveals that he saved 1/2 a million people of Kings Landing. He is an unsung hero, who was branded as "King Slayer" unjustly... though an accurate label, because he did "slay the mad king" ... but don't leave out the "mad" or what "mad" meant. Oh yeah, I know he is a Lannister, so everyone hates him, and he's been spoiled, but has he? Has he really? Yeah, he was bopping his sis... and yeah, he pushed our dear Bran, and so that makes him a despicable bastard, so he does need redemption, and the climax of this episode gives him that. And forgive me but, I love that naked backside so I can't say I minded it one bit.</p>
<p>All in all, I loved this episode, but then, I love this genre, and I don't need a Dragon burning a man to a crisp to feel the full wrath of their dramatic role. &nbsp;Daenerys Stormborn stood up to "male" authority.... and to a powerful slave owner, no less, and she has, again, proved her metal. That was a powerful scene, and forebodes of even more powerful scenes to come in the coming journey. Anyone who expects a rash attempt by her to go to westeros have not really contemplated the full numbers of opposition against her in westeros ... and again, those dragons need to grow much larger, and if you couldn't figure that out for yourself, Martin uses Granpa Tywin to school both his grandson AND YOU on the importance of letting those dragons grow to be really big with skulls the size of a carriage, or as they are now, which is little more than the size of a large apple. No, I am sorry, but anyone who (hasn't read the books and) thinks that she is gonna be attempting any attempts to retake the Iron Throne any time soon is not paying attention. Impatience is not a virtue in this realm. And, if you really immerse yourself in this realm, then you had better learn patience and paying attention to detail, and if you do, then you will be rewarded with true dramatic story telling that invokes the power of the subtle. That is your reward. That is real life... more real life than movieland LOTR flash and burn, not that I did not love LOTR, but this is a different genre than LOTR, it is a dramatic historical fiction type of storytelling genre, which is probably why Martin is taking so long to write his books, because he really takes painfully detailed patience in the writing, and I know how frustrating the wait for each book is, but the payoff is sublime. Just sayin'...</p>

<p>As an aspiring writer, I have nothing but admiration for what GRRM has accomplished. The Game of Thrones is light years better than the other well known fantasy series, The Wheel of Time and The Sword of Truth, both in terms of writing and plotting.</p>
<p>However, having said that, he does seem to be suffering from the same malady that the authors of those other series did -- i.e. bloat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's not that uncommon for authors of long series of books to lose their focus somewhat after the first few installments. In some cases, I get the sense that there is a shift in power away from the editor and toward the author when a series like this hits the big time, and it gets harder for the editor to tell the author that things are getting a little out of control.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, there is no doubt that the pacing of the later volumes of GoT slows considerably, and it's really not got much to do with the problem of juggling all those dynastic storylines. I won't spoil anything, but suffice to say that it was often a chore to get through all the unnecessary detail and passages of introspection in the last volume. But I'm hopeful that much of that won't translate to the screen anyway, so it's fairly likely that pacing won't be as much of an issue in the TV series.</p>
<p>That said, anyone hoping for the fates of many of the main characters in the series to be resolved soon are likely to be disappointed.</p>

<p>There were whole (very) long passages in ADWD that could easily have been cut without taking away anything from the story. The story also seems to be spiralling out of control, with too many new POV characters dropping in and then disappearing. I do appreciate what he's creating and what he's doing (and I do love many of the characters!), but when it starts to feel like I need a flow chart to keep track of what's going on, I think things are a little out of control, lol.</p>

<p>The show goes off in a thousand difference directions, has so many names &amp; places to remember you need a spreadsheet to even begin to surmise the plot.</p>
<p>The whole project is saved by the great acting of Peter Dinklage (the princely dwarf, Tyrion Lannister).</p>
<p>Of course, the Lannister clan hates Tyrion, which leads to conflict with this clan over there who hates that clan over here who claims a princess with pet dragons.</p>
<p>Take away the Dinklage character &amp; this whole show is a bad (or good, depending on how you look at it) Monty Python sketch.</p>

<p>"<em>business arrangement</em>?" Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>You know how Daily Kos works, so get off your (imaginary) high horse.</p>
<p>Smart people like smart shows, and want to discuss them.</p>
<p>I'm not even a fantasy fan, and I'm a follower of Game of Thrones (the sexual politics initially hooked me.)</p>
<p>Name the shows you watch, and I'll bet there's a clunker or two I'd slag.</p>
<p>But I wouldn't accuse "liberal" sites of being on the take (because that's ludicrous) if a writer covered it.</p>

<p>...but Daily Kos doesn't critique the books.</p>
<p>It critiques the laughably bad TV series.</p>
<p>And yes, Game of Throne is about politics.</p>
<p>It's about medieval psychopaths cutting bloody capers, lying, cheating &amp; making a general ass of themselves. &nbsp;All due to their unhinged lust for power.</p>
<p>So I can definitely see the &nbsp;21st century American political allegory in that.</p>

<p>because its been extended for another 'season', or 10 episodes, and it sure as hell feels like it, especially when you have to wait a week to watch another drawn out, slow episode. &nbsp;Eventually, it will get there, but its such a let down after getting all pumped up with the Season 2 finale, the white walkers on the march… &nbsp;Oh, well. &nbsp;Just show some more Emilia Clarke and I can slog through it with a smile.</p>

<p>I don't have cable, so haven't seen the show, but from EVERYTHING I've read, it adheres very closely to the novels.</p>
<p>Go: read them. Martin put in a TON of work, and a lot of thought, and they are wonderful. I've read them twice or three times so far.</p>
<p>Complex. Slow-moving. Lots of your favorite characters die.</p>

<p>This is the world. People do these things to each other.</p>
<p>We may do less of the physical torture and death in OUR society, but they're happening not too far away. A man our government sponsored and whose forces we trained was just convicted of genocide in Guatemala. And you can bet there's stuff very like this going on right now in Syria.</p>
<p>In our society today we're much nicer, of course. We mostly restrict the torture to the emotional kind - but that can be quite effective, especially on people who don't have the knowledge and training to know how they're being manipulated and abused.</p>
<p>And I sure wouldn't want to be a female Hispanic prisoner in Sheriff Arpaio's jail.</p>
<p>People do these things to each other. The best way to PREVENT that is to make sure that NICE people are aware of it, and do something about it. Not pretend it doesn't exist.</p>

<blockquote>Though I'm not too sure of Margaery's declaration that in marrying Tyrion, Sansa will become the lady of Casterly Rock.</blockquote>
Ah, but she didn't. The line was, "Your son--if I'm not mistaken--your son might be the lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday."<br />
<blockquote>One thing I really did not expect from Martin was a Theon torture interval. In the book, all the torture is off screen. But here it is again. On screen. &nbsp;And just as pointless as every other Theon torture scene. Moving on.</blockquote>
I think the purpose might have been that Martin wanted to ensure that no other writer took the scene too far. It's been left a bit ambiguous whether or not Theon got the full Varys treatment, or was mutilated in some other unpleasant way that might still allow him to create Issue.
<p>Other than those, though, I think you're spot-on: really not the best use of Martin's talents, especially with a couple of weddings coming up. In fact, I wouldn't be shocked if he had at least partial authorship credit on that one, too.</p>

<p>I thought this episode was developmental and I liked it with the exception of the bare assed mama wolf making out with daddy wolf. &nbsp;It didn't have the oomph of the other scenes.</p>
<p>I will say though, he is right that the bear scene didn't come off as well on screen as it did in the book.<br /></p>

<p>I believe he is forced to sexually perform with a female counterpart, plaything of the torturer, herself tortured too, for the pleasure of his torturer but in somewhat limited ways. &nbsp;And he's also very ashamed for people to see the extent of his mutilations so there's room for speculation. &nbsp;Haven't heard use of the name Reek in the series... his enforced filth was part of his degradation and I keep wondering if it will play a part in the onscreen depiction.</p>

<p>I'm not a huge fantasy fan either, but this one got my attention.</p>
<p>Fantasy aside, the series is basically about politics and family. What would you do to keep your family safe? What would you do to attain and HOLD ON to power? How do you keep your humanity in a world of unrelenting barbarism and cruelty? Questions ALL great literature/art asks, regardless of genre.</p>

<p>I didn't even know that Martin wrote this episode, and I thought it absolutely brought the goods. You are dealing with a lot of different characters in different places, and this also isn't the final episode of this season; but this was my favorite this season. The only close episode was 2 weeks earlier, when the Khaleesi had her first vengeance on the slavers. And that was my favorite scene from all of the books, pretty hard to top that buildup no matter who's writing the teleplay.</p>

<p>a critic who <strong>gets</strong> this series. The previous two seasons were trashed by people with absolutely no interest in nor tolerance for fantasy.</p>
<p>I remember reading the second season's review incredulously, going, <em>but that's how it happened in the book!</em> as the TV critic savaged it.</p>
<p>Well. <strong>This</strong> year, the critic was all in favor, but did point out that "a lot of it is exposition" which, after all, is only fair. A ton of what's in the novels is exposition too.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the whole series (TV or books, take your pick) is Martin's take on politics...and the body politic loses.</p>
<p>As in real life.</p>

<p>Todd VanDerWerf at the AV Club had this to say, which I didn't realize at the time, but is spot-on:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Finally, we have Dany, who’s doing her level best to free all the slaves, becoming a sort of Abraham Lincoln with dragons. (Hey, Spielberg: Free movie idea!) Emilia Clarke is really showing the steel that made her one of my favorites in season one, after a disappointing season two that seemed to mire her in pointless bullshit. (This was all by design, but it didn’t make it any more entertaining to see it happen.) What I love about how Dany is playing this is that her negotiations are aimed as much at the slaves attending the slavers as they are at the slavers themselves. She’s the one who’s figured out how to work the system to her advantage, and the slavers don’t seem to have any clue what kind of game she’s playing. It’s in this scene that MacLaren does her best work, always making sure that one of those bowing slaves is in the shot (or even the focus of the shot) as Dany and the Yunkai rich dude talk. She’s talking to him, but she’s also talking to everybody in the room; conditioned not to even see everybody in the room, he simply can’t realize what game she’s truly playing.</blockquote>

<p>It may seem slow at times, but when the end credits start rolling I'm thinking "That sure went by fast...I wish there was more. Can't wait till the next episode."</p>
<p>My own feelings at this point in time (having not read the books): Arya, Tyrion, and Dany have the most interest to me. Jaime I wouldn't trust one second, even though he did save Brienne (who's another good character) from the Bear. Jon Snow and Rob Stark don't seem quite up to the job for me, at least at this point. And all the Lannisters (save Tyrion) are oh so despicable (but oh so watchable) that you just keep hoping for their comeuppance (though given the twists that GRRM has supplied so far I guessing they'll be around quite a while--got to have a good villain, or set of villains, and they sure are that.) And if you must have torture, do a good share of it offscreen where a closing door followed by screaming (or a cut-away) can be just as effective (maybe even more so, think Hitchcock and the "Psycho" shower scene where we never actually see the knife penetrate but is still scary as hell.) It's getting to be just plain gratuitous now and does nothing more to further advance the story, plot, or character...we get it already.</p>

<p>Rhapsody in Blue happens to be my favorite classical work.

<p>This may have been pointed out in earlier diaries but one of the strong points of the series (and books) is Martin's ability to expose the the fact that simple, rigid honor as personified by the Starks is at least as destructive as the greed of the Lannisters. There would be no war if Ned had seized Joffrey with no intent to harm and assumed the regency, as other, more politic allies urged him to do after Robert's death. Winterfell wouldn't be a smoking ruin if Rob Stark's honor didn't send Theon Greyjoy back to the eel pit that is Pyle instead of a more experienced and less compromised ambassador. The Starks wear their honor as if it were armor when in reality it is a blinder as opaque as the covetousness of &nbsp;Lannisters.</p>
<p>Excellent series and excellent books. (Although the torture of Theon in the series has become the most obscene thing I've ever seen on television. Enough.)</p>

<p>about the only thing I want to hear or read about Mr. G. R.R. "IwannabeTolkien" Martin is that he has finished Books 6 and 7. I fell for his crap at the end of 3 that he couldn't wrap it up in only one book and thus 4 evolved into both 4 and book 5. as 5 got to the halfway point, I realized, too late, that there was way too much slave-saving going on (not that there's anything wrong with that) and way too little getting the Unsullied and Dragons on some boats to Westeros. I don't think he WANTS to wrap it up. and at this point, I doubt seriously that the next butt on the Iron Throne will be some character we have even met in books 1 through 5.</p>
<p>I have the same feeling that the Tarnsmen of Gor gave me around Book 8 in 1974. This thing will never be over. So I went to college and forgot about John Norman and Tarl Cabot completely.</p>

<p><strong><br />
MAYBE a spoiler alert</strong></p>
<p><strong>*</strong></p>
<p>OK, just finished reading all 5 books.</p>
<p>I AGREE with whoever used the word "bloat" to describe the books. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After 5 books, the story has not progressed very far. &nbsp;For example, <strong>and here is the spoiler:</strong></p>
<p>Daenerys is still wandering around freeing slaves instead of heading back to Westeros!!!!</p>
<p>Some prominent characters are dead. &nbsp;I'm assuming some of them will actually die this season on HBO. &nbsp;There are two really good death events in book three that would make for spectacular season-enders.</p>
<p>Other people are teased to be dead, and then show up 20 chapters later, (or a whole book later ) <strong>not</strong> dead. &nbsp;I have figured out that when GRRM writes a cliffhanger chapter where a character "dies", unless you hear their head hit the ground with a loud THUMP, it's just a tease and the person will show up later, maybe worse for the wear, but still alive and plotting/kicking/searching/wandering/whatever. &nbsp;Oh, and that chapter heading will use some OTHER name for that character, so you don't figure it out right away.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I care how this monstrosity ends anymore. &nbsp;If I were a masochist, I would go back, summarize each chapter with the one REAL thing that happens in that chapter, include notes about when the hypothetical dead person resurfaces, and what their new alias is, and post it all on a weblog.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe someone already did that? &nbsp;And here I wasted WEEKS reading the damn things.</p>
