   Thanks for your interest in We the People, a new tool on WhiteHouse.gov
   that allows all Americans to ask the Obama Administration to take
   action on a range of important issues facing our country.

   The petition you are trying to access has expired, because it failed to
   meet the signature threshold.

   the People on a similar issue that you'd like to add your name to. Or,
   you can create your own petition.

[159]History of Petitions

   The right to petition your government is guaranteed by the First
   Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Throughout our history, Americans
   have used petitions to organize around issues they care about from
   ending slavery, to guaranteeing women's right to vote, to the civil
   rights movement.
