   "Hurry up!"
   After Thursday's marathon session on immigration reform, today the
   Senate will be back at it, [29]hammering out the final details on the
   [30]Corker-Hoeven amendment--otherwise known as the "border surge
   plan"--designed to appease Republican senators enough to get their vote
   for a final, comprehensive immigration reform bill. (A bill that would
   then be sent to the House of Representatives where it will undoubtedly
   die a painful death under [31]the leadership of Speaker John Boehner.)

   What can we expect today? Probably a lot of garment rending and teeth
   gnashing from the Ted Cruz and Beauregard Sessions wing of the GOP
   caucus and an overwhelming win for the Gang of Eight and their
   followers. Stay tuned.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [44]Tagging tips - [45]Search For Tags - [46]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     "[A]ny immigration reform bill that is going to go into law ought to
     have a majority of both parties' support if we're really serious

   How could ANY bill on any divisive topic expect to get majorities in
   each of the parties?  How can that possibly be serious?

   Sessions say that currently with our existing guest worker programs,
   Visa Overstays are happening at a rate of 40%.

   Okay... he cites the CBO and I'll assume he's quoting correctly...but
   then he says that expanding the guest worker program, possibly to the
   point of doubling the amount of guest workers that enter the country
   will cause that over-stay to go up to 50%.

   ...hows that again?  Why would the additional people now accepted
   through a legal guest worker program be 20% more likely to overstay
   their visa thereby raising the average of the total pool by 10%?

   I wouldn't be surprised that this is all for naught.

   As many have noted, Boener can't get this through the House if he
   follows the "Hastert Rule" and insists on a majority of Republican
   votes to bring it forward. Many of the the ultra-right Republicans in
   the House are from gerrymandered districts with few immigrants, whose
   only interest in immigration is to atavistically express their
   conviction that this is a White Man's Republic.

   I love the politics because it's a lose-lose for the Republicans and
   Boener (lose the base or lose immigrants for at least a generation),
   but it's a tragedy for a rational immigration policy, undocumented
   immigrants, and the ideal of America as immigrant nation.  The "path to
   citizenship" in the Senate bill is already too long, IMO.

 Please educate me ([308]0+ / 0-)

   I only know of this Susie from what I read here.  So.. I would like to
   know how other countries deal with immigration.  Countries like, Canada
   Italy Germany Mexico, Israel ,,,etc. how do they deal with people
   coming to their countries.  Legally or " illegally".
   Thank you for your feedback.

       Wall aside, how to other countries regulate immigration into their
       countries, for example Joe Smith and Sally Johnson want to move to
       France, or Mexico, or Canada, what do those countries or require of
       them.

 well, they all have different requirements ([321]0+ / 0-)
       Most European countries have pretty large immigrant populations, so
       apparently it's not exceedingly hard to do.  I think the whole
       Eurozone made it pretty easy for people to emigrate from one
       country to another.
       South Africa wasn't very complicated either from what I heard from
       my South African friends.
