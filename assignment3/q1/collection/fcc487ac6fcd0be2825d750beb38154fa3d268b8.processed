New Mexico floods: Hundreds evacuated, governor declares emergency

   By Joe Netto, CNN
   updated 8:25 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Police diver carries group to safety across chest-deep rushing
       water
     * Evacuation count now in hundreds
     * Governor declares emergency
     * Flood threat for New Mexico continues through the weekend

   (CNN) -- More rain was on the way after flooding forced hundreds of
   people in New Mexico to evacuate, prompting Gov. Susana Martinez to
   declare an emergency Friday.

   Martinez' [41]declaration said evacuations by air and ground had taken
   place in Eddy County in southeastern New Mexico, Sierra County in the
   southwest part of the state and San Miguel County in the northeast.

   Her order provided funds for state emergency officials to assist local
   authorities and directed the National Guard to respond as needed.

   A state police diver and local firefighters staged a dramatic rescue of
   several people trapped by the rising Pecos River about 10 miles west of
   Roswell, officials said.

   The diver repeatedly crossed 30 feet of chest-deep rushing water
   carrying members of the group, which included children and elderly
   people. The evacuees were then taken to an American Red Cross shelter.

   Fifty people were moved to a Red Cross center at the high school in Las
   Vegas in northeast New Mexico, said Esteban Lujan, public information
   officer of the state Department of Homeland Security & Emergency
   Management.

   In Truth or Consequences, some bridges and roads were washed out and
   about 20 people evacuated, Lujan said.

   The National Weather Service said the threat of flooding will continue
   through the weekend.
