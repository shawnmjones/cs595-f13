<div class="dkimg-cap">Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe</div>
</div>
With just over three months to go in the 2013 elections (for the uninitiated ... yes, we have elections this year), the bulk of the interested observers and election junkies are casting their eyes to the South.
<p>Sure, Chris Christie is just one bloviation away from making any election competitive, and Democrat Barbara Buono is <a href="http://www.app.com/viewart/20130704/NJNEWS10/307040031/Buono-stepping-up-her-fundraising-game">amassing the resources</a> to take advantage of it when he does. But, in the state of Virginia, a gubernatorial race that has been a polling tossup all year, between two strong personalities, is what is garnering the lion's share of the attention.</p>
<p>Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the one-time head of the Democratic National Committee, is going heads-up with Republican state attorney general Ken Cuccinelli. McAuliffe has been this way once before, having run <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2009-06-10/news/36855032_1_terry-mcauliffe-brian-moran-northern-virginia">a surprisingly distant second</a> to Creigh Deeds in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2009. Cuccinelli ascended the ladder in a fairly conventional manner, moving up from the state legislature to the position of attorney general by easily defeating Steve Shannon in 2009 (his margin having been larger than any of his prior state legislative victories).</p>
<p>Both candidates are drawing a lot of political heat in this off-year election. So much so that a lot of folks are making assumptions about the race, some of which may be off the mark by a foot or two. Follow me below the fold for four assumptions that it seems like a lot of folks are making that are quite possibly errant.</p>

		</div>
		
		
			<p class="divider-doodle" />
		
		
			<div id="body" class="article-body">
<p><b>ASSUMPTION #1: Voters really don't like their choices here.</b></p>
<p>If there is a single article of faith about this Virginia gubernatorial election, it is the fundamental assumption that this is the "meh" election: a choice between two candidates that, for all intents and purposes, no one particularly loves.</p>
<p>In that regard, it is rather telling that one could practically see partisans from <i>both</i> sides of the ledger salivating when it became clear that McAuliffe and Cuccinelli were the presumptive nominees.</p>
<p>There is some data that would appear to bear this out. According to PPP's latest poll, <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_VA_716.pdf">both candidates</a> had underwater favorability ratings, with Cuccinelli looking markedly worse (32/47) than McAuliffe (34/36). However, those numbers are owed in part to the fact that, even as the bulk of voters are still giving the election minimal attention, both of these candidates are already absolutely reviled by partisans from the other team. McAuliffe, among Republicans, actually does as nearly as bad (9/57) as Cuccinelli does with Democrats (12/66).</p>
<p>However, as it happens, this week we also received some data that is, at a minimum, mildly contradictory to this "a pox on both your candidates" thesis.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/search-releases/search-results/release-detail?ReleaseID=1924&amp;What=&amp;strArea=20;26;&amp;strTime=0">Quinnipiac poll</a>, released on Thursday, had identical margins (and nearly identical toplines) as the PPP poll that was released earlier in the week. Both polls had Democrat Terry McAuliffe staked to a four-point edge over Republican Ken Cuccinelli. The only difference in the head-to-head trial heats was that both candidates scored a few points less on the PPP survey (owed almost certainly to the inclusion of Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis in PPP's poll, but not the Q poll).</p>
<p>Where the two pollsters diverged, and fairly substantially, was on the favorability ratings for both candidates. Whereas the aforementioned PPP numbers for both McAuliffe and Cuccinelli ranged from mediocre-to-awful, the Quinnipiac poll had both men in net-positive territory on their favorability numbers. The divide between the two candidates was still present, and almost identical: McAuliffe, in terms of net favorability, ran about a dozen points "warmer" than Cuccinelli (in this case, specifically, ten points better, with McAuliffe at a net plus-11, and Cuccinelli at a net plus-1).</p>
<p>Digging into the numbers here doesn't give us many answers. There is no obvious shift among party ID, for example, that explains the discrepancy. The most obvious thing appears to be that there were a considerably larger pool of voters in the Q poll without a strong opinion of the candidates. 70 percent of PPP's respondents either judged McAuliffe favorably or unfavorably, but only 49 percent of Quinnipiac's respondents were willing to do the same.</p>
<p>Which is another reason to be potentially skeptical of the "everyone hates the candidates" thesis. Both candidates (McAuliffe more so than Cuccinelli) are still at least partially undefined. That gives them the potential for "upside" as they spend their campaign coffers trying to define themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, the converse of that is that their opponents can also rush in and define them before they can define themselves. Which means that the "meh" election could very well still be a real thing, potentially.</p>
<p>Which leads us to ...</p>
<p><b>ASSUMPTION #2: The Libertarian candidate will be a factor in November.</b></p>
<p>If you buy a lot of stock in the first assumption, then it logically follows that one might believe that the election's outcome could be swung by a 30-something NoVa lawyer by the name of Robert Sarvis.</p>
<p>Sarvis is the nominee of the Libertarian Party, and he polled <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_VA_716.pdf">at 7 percent</a> in the PPP poll released earlier this week. A <a href="http://roanoke.edu/News_and_Events/News_Archive/RC_Poll_July_2013.htm">Roanoke College</a> poll this week, which had the rather sketchy topline of Cuccinelli +5, had Sarvis similarly in the mid-single digits.</p>
<p>What's more: There is at least a little precedent for the scenario of a third-party candidate playing a pivotal role in a statewide race in Virginia. The year was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Virginia,_1994">1994</a>, and the candidate (Marshall Coleman) scored 11 percent of the vote, which allowed Democratic incumbent Sen. Chuck Robb to survive the 1994 GOP onslaught with just 46 percent of the vote (the execrable Oliver North, the GOP nominee that year, came in with 43 percent).</p>
<p>So, in a close election (and nearly everyone presumes it will be close), could Sarvis make the difference?</p>
<p>Perhaps, but it doesn't seem all that likely.</p>
<p>For one thing, while 1994 does tell a story of a third-party candidate being a legitimate player amid two unloved major party candidates, there is a key distinction to be made here: Marshall Coleman was a known quantity, with nearly universal name recognition from the outset. In short, Coleman was a political player long before his independent bid for the Senate. He had famously run for governor on the Republican ticket in 1989 (losing to Democrat Douglas Wilder), and had been the state's attorney general before that. Furthermore, Coleman secured a number of major-league endorsements as a third-party candidate, primarily from mainstream Republicans appalled by their party's selection of North as the nominee.</p>
<p>Sarvis will enjoy none of those things. He has run for elective office before: he ran for the Virginia state Senate in 2011. And <a href="https://www.voterinfo.sbe.virginia.gov/election/DATA/2011/EB178FD6-875D-4B0D-A295-900A0482F523/Official/7_p2_s.shtml">he was soundly defeated</a> by veteran Democratic incumbent Dick Saslaw 62-36. He has scant name recognition, and it looks like he will <a href="http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/libertarian-candidate-for-governor-sees-undecided-voters-as-a-golden/article_77dc33b8-e5e6-11e2-b59c-0019bb30f31a.html">lack the resources</a> to build it (he had raised just $36,237 through May).</p>
<p>And about those slightly respectable poll numbers? Well, there could well be some connective tissue between 1994 and 2013 here, but not in a way that is amenable to the Libertarian candidate. Coleman won 11 percent of the vote, but he polled better than that in virtually every poll conducted during the 1994 cycle.</p>
<p>Veterans of Daily Kos Elections and other electoral junkies in good standing have long known this to be somewhat of an ironclad rule of polling: Third-party candidates rarely run as well as they poll. The "wasted vote" dilemma is a real phenomenon, and it manifests itself in election after election.</p>
<p>So, perhaps if the race comes down to 1-2 percentage points of margin, Robert Sarvis could play a spoiler role. It is unclear, though, for whom he would be spoiler (he drew pretty evenly from both candidates, based on the 2012 presidential preferences among Sarvis voters). So, his value to the election, barring implosion by one or both major-party candidates, seems limited.</p>
<p><b>ASSUMPTION #3: E.W. Jackson will be a millstone around Ken Cuccinelli's neck</b></p>
<p>Let's stipulate one thing: Republican E.W. Jackson, the nominee for the office of lieutenant governor, is legitimately <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/23/1211280/-Just-when-you-think-the-GOP-couldn-t-get-any-loonier-along-comes-E-W-Jackson">batshit</a>. When the irreplaceable Daily Kos writing institution better known as Hunter can do a multiple-installment feature on one candidate, you know that you've hit a goldmine.</p>
<p>As Jackson's ... ahem ... eccentricities became better known, the bulk of the political press covering the 2013 elections chalked off his prospects for election. However, that has not necessarily been borne out in recent data. The <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_VA_716.pdf">PPP poll</a> had Democrat Ralph Northam leading Jackson, but only by seven points. The <a href="http://roanoke.edu/News_and_Events/News_Archive/RC_Poll_July_2013.htm">Roanoke College poll</a> had it even closer, with Northam clinging to a two-point lead.</p>
<p>It's not that Jackson is accepted by Virginia voters, mind you. It is that he is essentially unknown. PPP had his fav/unfav at an ugly 15/28, but that still means the majority of voters do not have a concrete opinion of him. The Quinnipiac poll, mirroring their gubernatorial poll, found a lot more voters on the fence, as a whopping 81 percent of voters did not wish to share an opinion on Jackson.</p>
<p>This might be hard for some of us to understand or accept, but that plays into an often under-discussed phenomenon in American politics: The chasm between the depth of political information consumed by political junkies (like ourselves) and the depth consumed by the average voters, even during an election. In other words, <i>we</i> all know about Jackson and his forehead-slapping antics, but the average voter in Virginia does not. And may never do so, unless either (a) Ralph Northam marshals enough resources in a downballot race to finance a big information campaign or (b) the media takes an outsized interest in a downballot race, even at the expense of offering relatively less coverage of a tossup gubernatorial race. Option (a) is possible, but option (b) is comparably unlikely.</p>
<p>Lots of folks (and not just those on the left end of the spectrum) have long assumed that Cuccinelli will be hamstrung with a ticket-mate that seems to be completely unelectable in any state committed to ... well ... sanity. But for Jackson to be unelectable, there needs to be a universal knowledge among Virginia voters that he is unelectable. That could still happen, of course. But the data shows that it hasn't happened yet. And, it goes without saying: an anonymous E.W. Jackson is the best outcome that Ken Cuccinelli could hope for.</p>

		<p><b>More Tagging tips:</b></p>
		<p>A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?</p>
		<p>Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.</p>
		<p>If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. 
		CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.</p>
		<p>Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful.</p>

<p>One can vote Northam AND Cuccinelli, and my guess is that is what many will do.</p>
<p>I do think Jackson's views dont get a lot of attention until the fall when the race starts to heat up. Maybe that causes some awkwardness for KC, but I doubt it. That said, I think Jackson easily loses the Lt. Gov race. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Humans in some form have been around for at least 600,000 years. We stopped being hunter-gatherers maybe 5,000 years ago. Our brains are still mostly hunter-gatherer. That means we respond to narratives and personalities much more deeply than to logic.</p>
<p>Those are the rules of the game. The only question is: do we want to win? If so, then we nominate candidates with appealing personalities. Fortunately people with smarts and morals can also have appealing personalities. Though it does narrow the options.</p>

<p>...in comments myself on DKE in recent weeks.</p>
<p>No it's not clear either TMac or Cooch is damaged goods with the general electorate. &nbsp;PPP and Q-poll contradict on their favorable. &nbsp;Earlier polls by both and also by WaPo showed such high undecided that it was too early to say either had a clear public image. &nbsp;I've said for awhile they could go into the election with intact public images.</p>
<p>And it's a foregone conclusion the Libertarian won't matter. &nbsp;I don't know why people entertain this, it's the same as people insisting last year that Virgil Goode could matter in the Presidential race. &nbsp;Minor candidates never do anything in Virginia. &nbsp;Perot in '92 and '96 was the only one to register in my adult life, and he underperformed significantly in Virginia compared to the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>With Jackson, it's a given that he doesn't singularly drag down Cooch, and perhaps doesn't even contribute to such a thing, but it's at least slightly more ambiguous. &nbsp;There can be a synergy for a political party where several candidates with similar problems sink together, and while Jackson is in another league with Cooch and Obenshain, their ideological and policy positions are close enough to potentially hurt them all together in a way that doesn't necessarily show up in polling, but just sours voters on the party as a whole. &nbsp;Mostly Steve is right here, but Jackson has the potential to hurt on the margins.</p>
<p>McAuliffe clearly has a small edge over Cuccinelli right now, but undecided still are high which keeps it a tossup. &nbsp;I'll feel better when polling is showing something more like 46-42, rather than 41-37. &nbsp;If we're still up with undecideds down to around 10%, then we're in good shape.</p>

<p>this. It's all focused on McDonnell. Granted that the current governor showed a startlingly high level of corruption and that the amount of money &amp; gifts he graciously accepted from the fako-natural-medicine company dwarfs what Cuccinelli did. Still, Cuccinelli took money and bought &amp; sold stock in the company in a way that looks suspiciously like insider trading. They put Martha Stewart in jail for that -- why is Cuccinelli sailing along as though he has been untouched by the scandal?</p>

<p>(PREAMBLE): Even though McAuliffe has never won any political race of his own and even though his name is a household word among a huge swath of the over-50 crowd in the DC metro area, he only nabbed the VA primary nod by virtue of the fact that he was the only Dem to submit a candidate's petition. &nbsp;How unusual is that for a non-incumbent!!! &nbsp;Nonetheless, his margin of victory was zero (and yes, that's his best showing to date!).</p>
<p>McAuliffe is a terrible candidate because he's a polling disaster <em>and</em> because he comes across like a network marketing guru (I've seen him at his huckster-best, in person, and <a href="www.commondreams.org/views02/0628-08.htm0">wrote about it</a>), but also because he's a <em>consummate money-grubbing insider</em> and, no matter how hard he washes, he can't out that <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0707-08.htm">damn spot.</a></p>
<p>Any real Democrat worth his or her salt should be wiping the tarmac with Cooch. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/jeff-schapiro/schapiro-star-scandal-illustrates-tension-between-mcdonnell-cuccinelli/article_e8e6ef76-28b9-58ff-b7d6-91f0e68a659c.html">He's got the Gov's doo doo all over his wing tips</a>even though he's just today awkwardly joined the chorus for McDonnell's head.</p>
<p>Any real Democrat would be laughing already, starting to make policy and gubenatorial mansion decorating decisions. McAuliffe is saying ardent prayers that the most accurate polling outfit of the last cycle is way off base.</p>
<p>Assumption #4 is wrong?</p>

<p>Perhaps McAuliffe should help Virginia voters get more acquainted with Jackson. Yes, it's not, strictly speaking, his race. But to the degree people get to like Northam better, perhaps they'll just get out to the polls. Once you're there it's as easy to vote for two Democrats as to vote for one.</p>

<p>Buono in Jersey amassing her resources, but at this point, I don't think all the resources in the world could unseat Chris Christie. &nbsp;Democrats are flocking to his side as they shun Buono and the black ministers endorsed Christie last week, just so they would not be left out in the financial cold during a second Christie administration. &nbsp;That's right, the black ministers are endorsing a Republican. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next door in Pennsylvania, the Republican Party is making it harder for the black ministers congregations to cast their ballots, but in NJ, the black ministers are endorsing Christie. &nbsp;They are protesting the death of Trayvon Martin one day and endorsing Christie on the next. &nbsp;It must be great to have such malleable principles. &nbsp;</p>

<p>With all of the protests going on around the country over the immoral ruling in the Trayvon Martin case, perhaps activists in New Jersey should get Christie to give his own insights on the Trayvon Martin case. &nbsp;I am sure he thinks the jury was just fine, because so many people feel the same way, frightening as it seems. &nbsp;But, lets put pressure on him. &nbsp;(These minsters need to hear from their congregations too!)</p>
<p>Whenever a loudmouthed bully, Christie for example, is seen as being invincible, he or she usually falls apart at some point and we are all left to wonder what was the big deal in the first place. &nbsp;So, we might as well start the process now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not saying that Christie is a pushover, he isn't, but, we have to at least give him a run for his money (and his big mouth).</p>

<p>A presidential election is not one election; it is 51 separate and simultaneous elections (ignoring the split-by-CD in Maine and Nebraska). It matters very much where your votes come from. If we increase our performance in San Francisco from 85% to 90% or in Utah from 25% to 30% it accomplishes absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>In an election for statewide office such as governor, though, all votes count the same.</p>

<p>Howard Dean's 50 state strategy (which in a perfect world was touted as being represented in every county which, FWIW, is what Obama also essentially did) ultimately can overturn overlooked districts or counties which are assumed to be in the bag by Republicans. Nationally or statewide. Dean's strategy proved to be the difference between GOP running Congress and a wave election that went the other way. You can afford to lose a big state if you pick up a few others not expected to be a Colorado, a Nevada, a Florida.</p>
<p>Don't forget, Mark Twain brilliantly pointed out that if you don't like a particular political party just give them about 50 years to become the one you like. I won't sneeze at 90% in SF. It's all good wherever we can get votes including holding on to SF and gaining ground in Utah. Spending everywhere holds on to established ground (cheaply) while spending more in 'enemy' territory can produce important results.</p>
