   Bachmann
   Please hold your gaffes: In June 2011, Michele Bachmann made it clear
   that she believes she is a serious person. (Still image: CNN)

   Offered in no particular order, some of Michele Bachmann's most amazing
   moments:

     I haven't purposely been trying to be inflammatory. I'm trying to
     just explain to the American people what's happening here in
     Washington, D.C.
     [30]link

     Literally, if we took away the minimum wage--if conceivably it was
     gone--we could potentially virtually wipe out unemployment
     completely because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level.
     [31]link

     If you look at FDR, LBJ, and Barack Obama, this is really the final
     leap to socialism [...] they're trying to consolidate power, so we
     need to do everything we can to thwart them at every turn to make
     sure that they aren't able to, for all time, secure a power base
     that for all time can never be defeated.
     [32]link

     The news media should do a penetrating expose and take a look. I
     wish they would, I wish the American media would take a great look
     at the views of the people in Congress and find out are they are
     pro-America or anti-America.
     [33]link

   Michele Bachmann

     It's an urban legend that was created. That isn't what I said at
     all.
     [Note: She was answering a question about whether she had actually
     said the previous quote.]
     [34]link

     The real concerns is that there are provisions for what I would call
     re-education camps for young people, where young people have to go
     and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward and
     then they have to go to work in some of these politically correct
     forums.
     [35]link

   Continue below the fold for more Marvelous Michele Moments.

   MSNBC

     Absolutely, I'm very concerned that [Barack Obama] may have
     anti-American views.
     [36]link

     I think the people that Barack Obama has been associating with are
     anti-American, by and large.
     [37]link

     The imams, the imams were actually attending, ah, Congressman Keith
     Ellison's victory celebration, when he won as a member of Congress.
     And the imams went to the Minneapolis airport to leave and go home.
     While they were there, they were shouting phrases anti-Bush,
     anti-America and they laid their prayer shawls--er, their prayer
     rugs out on the floor in the airport terminal, were having their
     prayers, and um, were making these statements and when they got
     aboard the airplane, they switched seats, they didn't go to their
     proper seats, and they went in the pattern of the nine-one-one uh,
     um, terrorists who were on the airplanes, and they all asked for
     seatbelt extenders on their seats, in the airplane, and these
     weren't large people. So, uh, there were people on the airplane that
     became very nervous about these public displays and they alerted the
     airplane authorities, and so, these six imams were taken off of the
     airplane. Well, the imams ended up suing everyone on the plane, the
     whistleblowers, and they said that their civil rights were violated.
     So that's been a big mess, that case, and I don't, I'm not sure, but
     I don't believe that that's been resolved yet.
     [38]link

     Nothing scares members of Congress more than freedom-loving
     Americans.
     [39]link

     Well, President Obama is trying to bind the United States into a
     global economy where all of our nations come together in a global
     economy. I don't want the United States to be in a global economy
     where, where our economic future is bound to that of Zimbabwe. I
     can't, we can't necessarily trust the decisions that are being made
     financially in other countries. [...] so I think clearly this is a
     very bad direction because when you join the economic policy of
     different nations, it is one short step to joining political unity
     and then you would have literally, a one world government...I don't
     want to cede United States authority to a transnational
     organization.
     [40]link

   MSNBC

     What I want them to know is just like John Wayne was from Waterloo,
     Iowa, that's the spirit that I have too. It's really about not being
     ashamed of America. It's embracing America.
     [Note: The John Wayne from Waterloo, Iowa was serial killer John
     Wayne Gacy, not the movie actor.]
     [41]link

     One thing people know about me is I'm a substantive, serious person.
     [42]link

     There's a woman who came up crying to me tonight after the debate.
     She said her daughter was given [the HPV] vaccine. She told me her
     daughter suffered mental retardation as a result. There are very
     dangerous consequences.
     [43]link

     President Obama, if you look at nearly every decision he has made
     about this issue, it is to lift up the Islamists and to take down
     Israel.
     [44]link

     That's what I spent my whole year doing was talking about this issue
     of what the OIC was trying to do with their ten year plan and all of
     these efforts in the Obama administration. The only conclusion you
     could make is that they are embracing the ten year plan and are
     supporting it and that's why this October 19 document is so
     important because that is proof positive that every piece that is
     put into place is leading to one direction, this isn't deviating
     it's leading to one direction, and that ultimate goal it seems to be
     is to allow for mandating, following, every demand of the Islamist
     and we know what their ultimate demand is.

   Michele Bachmann eats corndog
   (Daniel Acker/Reuters)

     I think before his second term is over, we're going to see a miracle
     before our eyes, I believe God is going to answer our prayers and
     we'll be freed from the yoke of Obamacare. I believe that's going to
     happen and we saw step one last week with the repeal of Obamacare in
     the House. We have two more steps. We serve a mighty God and I
     believe it can happen.
     [46]link

     I don't know how much God has to do to get the attention of the
     politicians. We've had an earthquake; we've had a hurricane. He
     said, 'Are you going to start listening to me here?' Listen to the
     American people because the American people are roaring right now.
     They know government is on a morbid obesity diet and we've got to
     rein in the spending.
     [47]link

     Where do we say that a cell became a blade of grass, which became a
     starfish, which became a cat, which became a donkey, which became a
     human being? There's a real lack of evidence from change from actual
     species to a different type of species. That's where it's difficult
     to prove.
     [48]link

     We're in a state of crisis where our nation is literally ripping
     apart at the seams right now, and lawlessness is occurring from one
     ocean to the other. And we're seeing the fulfillment of the Book of
     Judges here in our own time, where every man doing that which is
     right in his own eyes--in other words, anarchy.
     [49]link

     This is not Michele Bachmann being a kook.
     [50]link

     I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine
     flu broke out then under another Democrat president, Jimmy Carter.
     And I'm not blaming this on President Obama, I just think it's an
     interesting coincidence.
     [51]link

     Does that mean that someone's 13-year old daughter could walk into a
     sex clinic, have a pregnancy test done, be taken away to the local
     Planned Parenthood abortion clinic, have their abortion, be back,
     and go home on the school bus that night?
     [52]link

     I want people in Minnesota armed and dangerous on this issue of the
     energy tax because we need to fight back. Thomas Jefferson told us
     'having a revolution every now and then is a good thing,' and the
     people--we the people--are going to have to fight back hard if we're
     not going to lose our country.
     [53]link

     The president of the United States will be taking a trip over to
     India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day.
     He's taking 2,000 people with him. He will be renting out over 870
     rooms in India. And these are five-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal
     Palace Hotel. This is the kind of over-the-top spending.
     [Note: This was completely false.]
     [54]link

     What I love about New Hampshire and what we have in common is our
     extreme love for liberty. You're the state where the shot was heard
     around the world in Lexington and Concord.
     [Note: The Battle of Lexington and Concord was in Massachusetts.]
     [55]link

     The very founders that wrote those documents worked tirelessly until
     slavery was no more in the United States. And I think it is high
     time that we recognize the contribution of our forebears, who worked
     tirelessly, men like John Quincy Adams, who would not rest until
     slavery was extinguished in the country.
     [Note: The Constitution gave legal recognition to slavery and Adams
     died nearly 20 years before the 13th Amendment which banned
     slavery.]
     [56]link

     I'm not saying that that's what the Administration is planning to
     do, but I am saying that private personal information that was given
     to the Census Bureau in the 1940s was used against Americans to
     round them up, in a violation of their constitutional rights, and
     put the Japanese in internment camps.
     [57]link

     This cannot pass. What we have to do today is make a covenant, to
     slit our wrists, be blood brothers on this thing. This will not
     pass. We will do whatever it takes to make sure this doesn't pass.
     [Note: She was talking about Obamacare.]
     [58]link

     If I felt that's what the Lord was calling me to do, I would do it.
     When I have sensed that the Lord is calling me to do something, I've
     said yes to it. But I will not seek a higher office if God is not
     calling me to do it. That's really my standard. If I am called to
     serve in that realm I would serve but if I am not called, I wouldn't
     do it.
     [Note: She was discussing her presidential bid.]
     [59]link

     Also with women politicians, [Democrats] want to make sure no women,
     no woman becomes president before a Democrat woman, and so they're
     doing everything they can to, I think, sabotage women like Sarah
     Palin, perhaps women like myself, or similarly situated women, to
     make sure that we don't have a prominent national voice.
     [60]link

     We're hoping that President Obama's policies don't succeed.
     [61]link

   State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa August 12, 2011. &nbsp;REUTERS/Daniel

     The liberals, and to be clear I'm NOT one of them, want you to think
     the Tea Party is the Right Wing of the Republican Party. But it's
     not. It's made up of disaffected Democrats, independents, people
     who've never been political a day in their life, libertarians,
     Republicans. We're people who simply want America back on the right
     track again.
     [62]link

     One man stood up, he was over 7-feet tall. He was a physician in the
     community.
     [63]link

     But what people recognize is that there's a fear that the United
     States is in an unstoppable decline. They see the rise of China, the
     rise of India, the rise of the Soviet Union and our loss militarily
     going forward. And especially with this very bad debt ceiling bill,
     what we have done is given a favor to President Obama and the first
     thing he'll whack is five hundred billion out of the military
     defense at a time when we're fighting three wars.
     [64]link

     Obama has to go and has to be replaced, but not just by anyone. We
     need someone who is committed to taking that [Obamacare] out,
     because it is the crown jewel of socialism, and if it's allowed to
     stand we will never get our country back.
     [65]link

     I take my first political breath every morning with one thought in
     mind -- repeal Obamacare. That's my motivation in life. This bill is
     something else. It is the crown jewel of socialism. President Obama,
     and I'm willing to say it, ushered in socialism under his watch...my
     opinion is we can't shut this president down fast enough.
     [66]link

     I haven't had a gaffe.
     [67]link

     I wish I could be more artful in the way that I say things.
     [68]link

     It really was, we were extremely careful, and we were almost mistake
     free, but for those two points, Elvis Presley's birthday and John
     Wayne's birthplace. I've apologized, and we moved beyond.
     [On her presidential campaign.]

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [86]Civil
   Rights, [87]Community, [88]Congress, [89]Culture, [90]Economy,
   [91]Education, [92]Elections, [93]Energy, [94]Environment, [95]Health
   Care, [96]International, [97]Labor, [98]Law, [99]Media, [100]Meta,
   [101]National Security, [102]Science, [103]Transportation, or
   [104]White House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding
   the state ([105]California, [106]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though,
   that there are many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in
   any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       conveyed to her by...well, who knows?...and had kind of a
       [207]full-on wingnut/Iraq/fantasy meltdown:

     2007: In an interview with the St. Cloud Times, Bachmann drops a
     bombshell: Iran is planning on turning all of Northwest Iraq into a
     secret terrorist training camp: "Iran is the troublemaker trying to
     tip over apple carts all over Baghdad right now because they want
     America to pull out. And you know why? It's because they've already
     decided, that they're going to territory, they're- they're going to
     partition Iraq and half of Iraq, the western northern portion of
     Iraq is going to be called, the United, uh, the, the uh, -oh, I'm
     sorry, I can't remember the actual name of it now, but it's going to

     (They) have been schooled in the course of many centuries. Today he
     passes as 'smart,' and this in a certain sense he has been at all
     times. But his intelligence is not the result of his own
     development, but of visual instruction through foreigners. For the
     human mind cannot climb to the top without steps; for every step
     upward he needs the foundation of the past, and this in the
     comprehensive sense in which it can be revealed only in general
     culture. All thinking is based only in small part on man's own
     knowledge, and mostly on the experience of the -time that has
     preceded. The general cultural level provides the individual man,
     without his noticing it as a rule, with such a profusion of
     preliminary knowledge that, thus armed, he can more easily take
     further steps of his own. The boy of today, for example, grows up
     among a truly vast number of technical acquisitions of the last
     centuries, so that he takes for granted and no longer pays attention
     to much that a hundred years ago was a riddle to even the greatest
     minds, although for following and understanding our progress in the
     field in question it is of decisive importance to him. If a very
     genius from the twenties of the past century should suddenly leave
     his grave today, it would be harder for him even intellectually to
     find his way in the present era than for an average boy of fifteen
     today. For he would lack all the infinite preliminary education
     which our present contemporary unconsciously, so to speak,
     assimilates while growing up amidst the manifestations of our
     present general civilization.

     There's a woman who came up crying to me tonight after the debate.
     She said her daughter was given [the HPV] vaccine. She told me her
     daughter suffered mental retardation as a result. There are very
     dangerous consequences.

   I'm thinking that is a genetic inheritance, not a vaccine reaction...

   Most people on kos probably have eliminated "friends" and family with
   similar viewpoints, but I'm now visiting family--and some of them
   believe everything Bachmann is quoted as having said.  Actually, many
   seem to be quoting her now.  One lawyer claims he needs guns to
   overthrow the socialist Kenyan--and he's serious.    I know it's
   unpleasant, but everyone here should try to talk to neighbors who watch
   FOX--you will realize that facts and logic are not important to
   them--they have "contacts" who keep them informed.

     Where do we say that a cell became a blade of grass, which became a

     human being? There's a real lack of evidence from change from actual
     species to a different type of species. That's where it's difficult
     to prove.

   Where does one even start, trying to address a comment like this?

   Beyond the ridiculousness of her understanding of evolutionary biology,
   there's the fact that as "difficult" as it is to prove, in her opinion,
   how much MORE difficult is it to "prove" that an invisible being made
   everything?

   Which is what [DEL: Creationism :DEL] Intelligent Design is attempting,
   and failing, to do.

   Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it isn't a fact, Michele.
