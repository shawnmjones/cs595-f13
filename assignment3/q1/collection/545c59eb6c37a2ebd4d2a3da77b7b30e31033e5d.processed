[24]NBC News: Fracking Conclusively to Blame for Ohio Earthquakes

   From NBC News:

     Before January 2011, Youngstown, Ohio, which is located on the
     Marcellus Shale, had never experienced an earthquake, at least not
     since researchers began observations in 1776. However, in December
     2010, the Northstar 1 injection well came online to pump wastewater
     from fracking projects in Pennsylvania into storage deep
     underground. In the year that followed, seismometers in and around
     Youngstown recorded 109 earthquakes, the strongest registering a
     magnitude-3.9 earthquake on Dec. 31, 2011. The well was shut down
     after the quake.

     ...

     The new investigation of the Youngstown earthquakes, detailed in the
     July issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters, reveals that
     their onset, end and even temporary dips in activity were apparently
     all tied to activity at the Northstar 1 well.

     For instance, the first earthquake recorded in Youngstown occurred
     13 days after pumping began, and the tremors ceased shortly after
     the Ohio Department of Natural Resources shut down the well in
     December 2011. In addition, dips in earthquake activity lined up
     with Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and
     other times when injection at the well was temporarily stopped.

     "Earthquakes were triggered by fluid injection shortly after the
     injection initiated -- less than two weeks," researcher Won-Young
     Kim, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
     Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., told LiveScience...

   [30]http://t.nbcnews.com/...

   It's interesting to note that definitive proof of a correlation between
   the fracking and the quakes took two and a half years to uncover. In
   this instance, earthquakes began soon after the well went online. But
   in other suspected cases of frack-induced quakes, the tremors didn't
   occur until as much as a decade after pumping started. If we allow
   fracking to continue unabated in this country, who knows what sorts of
   disasters await us in the years to come.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Total fucking madness.  Public officials who sanction fracking in
       their California jurisdictions should be held personally liable for
       losses of life and property.

   and the California Coastal Commission "didn't  know about it." until a
   couple of months ago. Not that the CCC could DO anything about it:
   their mission is to monitor the coastal environment only.   But one
   doesn't monitor things one doesn't know about, does one? [464]Source.

   And now we are going to send water to help the frackers in Socal.[465]
   Source. Big ass project to benefit Big Oil at the expense of
   agriculture and the fisheries.

     There's a new water interest bidding for California's limited water
     supplies, and the managers of California's historic
     agriculture-centric water districts in the Central Valley aren't
     smiling.
     With a finite supply of water, Sacramento may have to choose between
     expanding food production or fracking wells and oil and natural gas
     production. Either option will likely lead to increases in food or
     energy costs for consumers.
     Out-of-state, (primarily Texas-headquartered) energy companies with
     deep pockets from record profits and the strongest lobby in
     Sacramento are anxious to extract as much severance tax-free
     California oil from the ground as quickly as possible.
     Anticipating that a Democratic two-thirds majority could finally
     mean an end to their decades long free ride they spent so much
     political action money achieving, not just Exxon/Mobil, but Texaco,
     Chevron and British Petroleum are all outbidding agricultural water
     interests by a 3-to-1 margin.
     For California farmers, the loss of hundreds of thousands of acre
     feet of water from the districts means an increase in rates and
     fewer acre feet allotments intended for new groves of pistachios and
     almonds, vineyards of grapes and fields of water-intensive alfalfa,
     tomatoes and corn, that likely will be planted either without
     increases in acreage or an increase in fallowed fields this year.

   If someone wants to claim our purpose in our National Security Strategy
   is to protect the US..., they'd have a hard time. It would be much
   easier to make the case that the conscious purpose is to spread chaos,
   confrontation, and terror. Jim P

   don't know jack about any of this stuff.

   Anyway, somebody posted this earthquake story. Wouldn't you know one of

   isn't the fracking that causes the quakes. It's the wastewater

   Of course, without the frackers, we wouldn't need the wastewater wells
   now would we?

   There's no talking to most people around here though. Not as long as

       us on those acres and they divide the royalty up according to how

   they think they will get in royalties.  The fracking companies have the
   right to withhold arbitrary amounts for expenses, and they do not have
   to disclose their books or the formulas used to calculate the
   royalties.  People are being promised literally millions, and many are

       Once my mom got $200 for the year off my Grandmothers place, they
       closed the well.  2 yrs later they send a letter asking for my mom
       to sell the mineral rights to them for the well for only $200.  She
       wrote back, "bull&$*%, do you think I am a fool?  I worked back in
       my youth for an oil company, I know what you are doing". And she
       was right.  They did re-open the well as a "new" well by drilling a
       little deeper and by re-fracking the well.  The royalty is $500/mo.
        It is no longer an oil well, but gas.  We were only 3 that did not
       sell out.  And we have a acre lot in that 20 acre pull field.

   In theory anyway. There are so many things to watch in this gig it's
   mind-boggling.

   One thing I learned on that forum was the good and bad types of leases,
   and the one thing to watch is that they don't slip in things like
   "marketing enhancements." that means the refining process they have to
   do anyway, but having that in a lease will but the cost of it on you
   because, in their words "without it, your gas is worthless."

   Well, if it's worthless, what the fuck do they want it for?

   Other things are to make sure you're not paying their taxes for them,
   and making sure someone in your unit is watching the meter on the well
   head so they don't try and fudge the numbers

   As you say, you have to keep your eyes on these folks all the time
   because they'll screw you in a heartbeat. IOW, you kind of have to
   become a partner in their business. No such thing as a free lunch.

   The earthquakes that are being triggered are interesting, but they are
   very very small. They are not a danger to life or property.

   It's the water that makes my hair stand on end. Contaminating large
   swaths of water IS possible, and that could render an area effectively
   uninhabitable.

   They pretty much just say "Here's the water you want! Frack away!"

   Also to be clear, fracking itself does not cause earthquakes. It's the
   injection wells disposing of the frack waste that does.

   This is stupefying!  But it makes immediate sense, particularly on
   shale (sedimentarly layers), whereas quakes might take longer in
   different terrains (different substrates).

   I read recently (probably here!) that fracking had started in the
   Shawnee National Forest, which covers most of the southern tip of
   Illinois.  Three rivers meet at the southeast corner of the state --
   the Wabash, the Missouri (?) and the Mississippi.  The Madrid Fault
   quakes of 1811-1812 (which rang church bells in the Northeast states)
   had their epicenter just a few miles south of the Illinois southern
   tip, in Missouri.

   Can't help but wonder, now, what fracking will do the the Madrid Fault.

       Fracking might potentially help it to happen a wee bit sooner but
       it's not going to cause an earthquake of that size. It's already
       "caused" and already long overdue.
       So bolt your houses to your foundations, and bolt your tall

     South Texas experienced a magnitude 4.8 earthquake in Oct. 2011 near
     the Eagle Ford Shale Play, which is home to over 550 gas wells.
     There have been many other earthquakes linked to injection wells in
     the Dallas-Fort Worth area, over 50 since 2008. There were no
     earthquakes before then.
       [867]http://stateimpact.npr.org/...
       Local media reported quakes near a small east Texas town over Labor
       Day - and that is all they reported. No explanation or exploration
       for why such a thing would happen in an otherwise not quake prone
       area. I had never heard the name of that small town, but
       immediately plugged it into Google, along with the word fracking -
       and surprise, surprise - the town is surrounded injection wells

     Last year a magnitude 4.8 struck the area. In January of this year
     two more quakes hit, one of them causing damage. In February, a
     third quake hit measuring 4.1. And just this Monday two more
     earthquakes, one measuring 4.1, and another measuring 4.3, shook the
     town.

     Up until the recent spate of quakes, Timpson had never felt an
     earthquake before, at least not since the USGS started keeping
     records.
     Timpson now has somewhat frequent earthquakes, but it also has a lot
     of something else: injection wells for storing waste water produced
     by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.  By our last count, Shelby
     County where Timpson is located, is home to 27 active injection
     wells.

       The quakes were caused by pumping fracking wastewater into the
       ground. Fracking causes huge volumes of wastewater, that is
       routinely pumped into the ground. The wastewater pumping is an
       essential part of fracking. The wastewater pumping is fracking.
       Fracking caused the earthquakes.

       the wastewater could have (and often does) come from any industrial

       Elsewhere in this part of Ohio, [980]there are induced earthquakes
       from the injection of industrial waste into the ground.

       Yes, it could have come from anywhere. But it in fact didn't. It
       came from fracking. Therefore, in reality, the wastewater is
       fracking, and fracking caused the earthquakes.
       Your point means that not only fracking can cause earthquakes. Yes,
       this is also bad news for geothermal.
       That does not mean it's not bad news for fracking. Northwatch is
       wrong.

       the earthquakes would have happened no matter where the fluid came

       defines the problem of induced earthquakes. it's probably what the

       your opinion that the fracking caused these particular earthquakes

 So What? ([1016]0+ / 0-)
       I'm not complaining that you're nitpicking, because that would be
       saying you're right but the degree of error doesn't matter. I'm not
       saying that.
       It's not my problem that the scientific paper limited its scope to
       only the part of the fracking that causes earthquakes, and referred
       to that scope, because that scope goes beyond just fracking. But it
       is your problem that you inisist on a logical fallacy that since
       other activities also include wastewater pumping, that fracking
       somehow doesn't include them.
       What I'm saying, what this diary is saying, is that fracking
       includes the wastewater pumping, and that the pumping causes
       earthquakes. A part of fracking causes earthquakes, therefore
       fracking causes earthquakes.
       Again, do you say that burning coal doesn't cause climate change?
       Because that is the logic you are using here.

 i'm saying your therefore is wrong. ([1021]0+ / 0-)
       If that water were forced down there and then was used to turn
       steam turbines and earthquakes occured (and they would have
       occured, for this particular well) i  suspect this diary would have
       been much different. perhaps even ignored, because geothermal
       energy is green and therefore automatically good, in liberal and
       progressive spheres. But it's the exact same thing as wastefluid
       injection.
       It's disengenuous to say "fracking causes earthquakes" when in this
       case, it did not. Fluid injection did. It does not matter where the
       fluid came from. I realize some liberals and progressives have to
       have an agenda in all things though even if it means being wrong
       about something. "Fracking caused Ohio earthquakes" is a far
       sexier, and scarier headline than "fluid injection caused Ohio
       earthquakes, a process known to be possible since the 1960s."  The
       first headline is not correct. The second one is correct.
       I've never been a fan of being emotionally dishonest or
       manipulative to stop a distasteful and damaging process. There are
       roughly 30,000 of these wells nationwide. 99% aren't a problem.
       That 1% requires there to be some regulation or law to be required
       because none really exist. You can't even get a successful lawsuit
       in most states. That was what I was thinking of in my half-snarky
       response about the caucus diaries.
       I'm more willing to listen to and support people who say "I want to
       regulate and/or ban the injection of fluids into deep wells for all
       processes" then people who say "I want to regulate and/or ban the
       injection of fluids created by fracking into deep wells." The
       second group knows little of what they are talking about. The first
       group knows there's little to no regulation at all and that this is
       a major problem.

       Explain to me how one part of a process causing earthquakes doesn't
       mean that the process as a whole doesn't cause earthquakes. Explain

 These are still very small earthquakes ([1060]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1061]terrypinder

   I think the idea that fracking can cause small earthquakes has never
   been all that outlandish or surprising.

   What is unsupported is the idea that fracking can cause large, damaging
   earthquakes that otherwise would not occur. That is still true.
   Fracking does not inject enough energy into the crust to create the
   stresses for a moderate to large earthquake.

   What fracking may do is influence what faults break first and exactly
   when they break. But still, this is potential energy already in the
   crust that is going to release eventually. Even in places that don't
   usually experience regular earthquakes.

   For reference, a magnitude 4 earthquake feels like a sonic boom, and
   you'll usually only notice it if you're quite nearby and sitting fairly
   still in a quiet place.

   (Although the waste-water well in question was indeed used to dispose
   of fracking water.)

     The researchers did note that of the 177 wastewater disposal wells
     of this size active in Ohio during 2011, only the Northstar 1 well
     was linked with this kind of seismic activity, suggesting this
     ability to cause earthquakes was rare. Kim personally felt injecting

   Efficient operators are recycling as much  water back into fracking as
   they can.  Waste water injection is not inevitable but in certain
   geologic settings (e.g. naturally salty groundwater in porous media) it
   is a pretty safe way to dispose of waste water. It may become unsafe

       This region never had any quakes at all. How is it that these
       quakes could even possibly be a good thing? By averting a 2.0 quake
       sometime in the next couple of centuries?
       How about the same effect in seismically active places that are
       just not as clearly caused by the fracking? If 10% of quakes are
       "good" because they relieve pressure, but we can't choose whether
       to frack a good or a bad quake, then fracking isn't at all worth
       the risk. Shaking the dynamite is a bad idea, even if some small
       fraction of the time you manage to shake the dynamite into inert

     out. Because of the slightly pliable nature of the mortar, it can
     move with the expansion and contraction of the brick and small
     cracks can actually repair themselves. The presence of a small
     amount of water in a wall is required for curing and actually
     beneficial in maintaining the flexibility of the mortar.
       I'm not finding any industrial pages that address this. Pay walls

       You're thinking these are shakes. They're just not. They're very
       very very small. For example, running vibrating equipment inside,
       like a printing press, or other large machinery would vibrate the
       building more.
       Here is a lesson I learned early on as an engineering student.
       We were asked to calculate the downward force that was added to the
       rear of a car by adding a spoiler.
       We calculated that the additional force was about 50 pounds.
       "Is that significant?" the professor asked.
       Many of us thought so; 50 lbs is noticeable weight.
       "Do you see a difference in how your car handles if you put a 100
       lb person in the back seat?" he asked. "What about 150 lbs, or two
       people?"
       "Oh." we all realized.
       -----
       As it happens, seasonal expansion and contraction is in fact very
       damaging to buildings and to other structures. In my own experience
       - and remember, I live in California and have lived through several
       large earthquakes - those seasonal changes are much more damaging
       to buildings than small earthquakes.
       2.0 or less is known as a microearthquake. There are millions of
       these a year, many of which are unreported because much of the
       world is not instrumented finely enough to record them.

       Richter scale does not matter with some materials. It is the
       duration and repetition that does it.
       This clearly says nothing about size of the quake, just the
       repetition:

     Six principal factors influence how and why historic buildings are
     damaged in an earthquake:

     Depth of the earthquake and subsequent strength of earthquake waves
     reaching the surface
     Duration of the earthquake, including after-shock tremors
     Proximity of the building to the earthquake epicenter, although
     distance is not necessarily a direct relationship
     Geological and soil conditions
     Building construction details, including materials, structural
     systems, and plan configuration;
      and
     Existing building condition, including maintenance level.

     ...Typical earthquake damage to most older and historic buildings
     results from poor ductility--or flexibility--of the building and,
     specifically, poor structural connections between walls, floors, and
     foundations combined with the very heavy weight and mass of historic
     materials that are moved by seismic forces and must be resisted. In
     buildings that have not been seismically upgraded, particularly
     unreinforced masonry buildings, parapets, chimneys, and gable ends
     may dislodge and fall to the ground during a moderate to severe
     earthquake. Walls, floors, roofs, skylights, porches, and stairs
     which rely on tied connections may simply fail. Interior structural
     supports may partially or totally collapse. Unreinforced masonry
     walls between openings often exhibit shear (or diagonal) cracking.
     Upper stories may collapse onto under-reinforced lower floors with
     large perimeter openings or atriums. Unbraced infill material
     between structural or rigid frame supports may dislodge. Adjacent
     buildings with separate foundations may move differently in an
     earthquake creating damage between them. Poorly anchored wood frame
     buildings tend to slide off their foundations. Ruptured gas and
     water lines often cause fire and water damage. Many of these
     vulnerabilities can be mitigated by understanding how the forces
     unleashed in an earthquake affect the building, then planning and
     implementing appropriate remedial treatments...

     ...Buildings of more rigid construction techniques may also have
     seismic deficiencies. Masonry infill-wall buildings are generally
     built of steel or concrete structural frames with unreinforced
     masonry sections or panels set within the frame. [1302]While the
     structural frames may survive an earthquake, the masonry infill can
     crack and, in some cases, dislodge. The reaction of concrete
     buildings and concrete frame structures is largely dependent upon
     the extent and configuration of iron or steel reinforcement. Early
     buildings constructed of concrete are often inadequately reinforced,
     inadequately tied, or both, and are thus susceptible to damage
     during earthquakes

       we build for earthquakes whether big or small.
        Use your brain, seismic activity will cause damage in buildings
       not designed for it. I don't care how small or big the quake is,
       it's common sense. Ground shifts, thing get misaligned or the
       mortar breaks down faster etc etc damage will be done.
        However none of that compares to the fact that HUMAN action is
       triggering repeated seismic events in areas that are not
       seismically active. How is this NOT a problem?

     The scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale. The magnitude is defined

   and think about what it would really cover for you, compared to the
   cost, and compared to your likely damage. If it is expensive, and if
   your home is wood frame construction, it may not be a good deal.

   If your home is wood frame, where I'd spend your money first is:

   - bolting the walls to the foundation
   - adding shear resistance to any large expanses of walls (can be done
   by adding plywood or by adding metal strapping)
   - strengthen/retrofit any unreinforced masonry, especially chimneys
   - if you have natural gas, consider an earthquake shutoff valve.
   - bolt your tall furnishings and bookshelves to the walls, and check to
   see that nothing heavy might fall on a bed.
   - an earthquake/disaster kit with a supply of water, batteries, etc.

   A single story wood frame house is very likely to survive intact in
   even a large earthquake if it is well constructed.

       a legitimate scientific source?
       I almost didn't click on this diary because its title said the
       fracking-small quake correlation = causation had been determined by
       NBC. Of course, for the general public, sadly, that means far more
       than GRL or JGR or PhysRev.  Even highly intelligent Kossacks would
       prefer the result were absolutely clear.  Hell, as a mere
       scientist, so would I.
       Yeah, it's sometimes a pain having a Ph.D., isn't it?  (Mine is in
       physics.)  One so often puts in question general excitement at
       results that seem so obvious but remain scientifically ambiguous.
       Or one says nothing, knowing the usual reaction to bursting a
       bubble:  blame the messenger.
       Doesn't mean we're any less blue or progressive, just that we look
       at science from a different angle -- from lives immersed in the
       scientific method.  Not better -- just different.
       FWIW.

   It was not the fracking.  It was the injection of waste fracking fluid,
   that caused the earthquakes.   There is a difference.

     The earthquakes were apparently centered in an ancient fault near
     the Northstar 1 well, and Kim suggested pressure from wastewater
     injection caused this fault to rupture. The quakes crept from east
     to west down the length of the fault -- away from the well --
     throughout the year, a sign that they were caused by a traveling
     front of pressure generated by the injected fluid.

     The researchers did note that of the 177 wastewater disposal wells
     of this size active in Ohio during 2011, only the Northstar 1 well
     was linked with this kind of seismic activity, suggesting this
     ability to cause earthquakes was rare. Kim personally felt injecting
     wastewater deep underground "is a fairly good method of massive
     fluid waste disposal."

     Kim stressed these earthquakes are not directly related to fracking
     of rock for natural gas. "They are due to injection of waste fluid
     from fracking," he noted.

   though the plethora of anecdotal information should be enough to
   convince the intellectually honest. I agree we are sure to see some
   disastrous long term consequences, the least of which might be seismic.
   Rather it's the toxic cocktail being made of the life-giving
   groundwater.

   Humans seem to have a limitless capacity fuck things up. Our air is
   being saturated with CO2 and increasingly escaping methane. We've
   scarred up and laid waste to the surface and its flora and fauna. Our
   oceans have become vast dumping grounds. Now we are intent on
   destroying what lies beneath us.

   In some distant future, scientists from some other specie of sentient
   beings will study this planet and report dispassionately that this once
   awesome ball of a planet was put to ruin by a most foul specie of
   parasite that called itself "humanity."

 fracking problems ([1577]0+ / 0-)

   The earthquake problems reported (so far) have all been related to deep
   well disposal of toxic back flow liquids in both the Marcellus Shale
   and Barnett Shale (near Dallas).  Please folks read the reports and
   understand before going off on a rant.  I am not pro fracking but given
   a choice between coal and fracking the latter is less destructive to
   the environment IF it is done a bit less profitably and with full
   disclosure of the fluids involved.  Now as far as all that natural gas
   lowering your heating bills you'll have to get in line since most of it
   is currently being liquefied and shipped overseas.  We don't have the
   necessary infrastructure to utilize it as it should be (for 18 wheeler
   fuel) and we won't because the fossil fuel folks don't want to see your
   costs (and their profits) decline.  Your friend T. Boone Pickens
   already owns more water table than anyone else and he will be happy
   when the price of a gallon of potable water exceeds the cost of a
   gallon of gas.  They are greedy pigs one and all and they have already
   bought much of your government.  Vote them out along with their noisy
   supporters (the Tea Bags) who don't know they have been conned nor by
   whom.  But what do I know I'm just a curmudgeon in Corpus.
