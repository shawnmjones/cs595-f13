Instead of going home, he hung around and confronted and assaulted that guy. There was nothing illegal,about anything Zimmerman did, the dead kid was the aggressor, and all the evidence along with the one eye witness support Zimmerman's version of events.\n\nAt that moment, in the moment as it happened, not months later with additional info in 20\/20 hindsight, according to the law, what matters was what Zimmerman was thinking at the time he was getting his ass kicked by the guy on top of him- in that moment, Zimmerman doesn't know it's just a kid with skittles. It's the guy beating the hell out of him. He doesn't know if Martin is armed. He doesn't know if Martin is going to kill him if the blows continue. He doesn't know if he's going to suffer great bodily harm if the beating continues. He doesn't know how badly hell be hurt or if he will be killed if he goes unconscious. He doesn't know if he will be shot to death with his own gun if the guy beating the hell out of him takes his gun. If, in the moment, Zimmerman feared great bodily harm or death, he is totally justified using deadly force in self defense.\n\nHe never used the word \"black punks.\" I believe the term was \"fucking punks\" and he used the word \"assholes.\" He only described Martin as \"he looks black\" after the dispatcher asked him if the person was white, black, or Hispanic. The break ins in the neighborhood were young black males so even if he did \"profile\" was it racism or a logical reasonable suspicion based on certain facts? Every time crap went on in my neighborhood as a kid it was done by white kids and the cops always hassled us white kids... Were they profiling or racist or were they just using facts and reaching logical suspicions?\n\nThis case is tragic, but racism had not a damn thing to do with it and under the law Zimmerman, given the moment it happened and the info or lack thereof he had at the time he was getting his ass beat had simple reason to fear great bodily harm or death.

Jurors have to base their decision on the evidence, not on a possible description of what happened, and while there is no evidence that Zimmerman downright harassed Martin, beyond walking after him a few meters to see where he was going, there is evidence that Martin was on top of Zimmerman, beating him in the head. There's witness testimony, there are grass stains on the back of Zimmerman's jacket, and there are Zimmerman's injuries. There's also evidence that the shot was fired when Martin was on top of Zimmerman, leaning towards him. \n\nI don't think Martin was a thug, I think he was just a normal kid who got intimidated by the guy watching him and reacted unwisely by choosing to confront him instead of going home, and it ended with this senseless tragedy, an unarmed teen getting shot to death. On the other hand, Zimmerman has proven to be aggressive in the past (though not racist) and was likely acting as a vigilante on this one, but there is no evidence that he started the fight. He could've been wiser and stayed in his car, he could've been nicer on the phone call to 911, but that doesn't count as evidence that he's a racist murderer.\n\nI'm not American, I can't say whether the trial would've gone otherwise had those implicated had different skin color, but if the answer is yes, isn't that a reason to look for justice in trials against black defendants, instead of convicting non-blacks without the necessary evidence?

So maybe you are the one guilty of painting \"facts\" with your opinion.  Because your facts are, in fact, not facts.  You are just one of a few million suckers who bought what the media was selling.  They wanted to sell advertising and you bought in.  Even when it was shown that the media was lying and doctoring tape, you still bought in.  Even as the story fell apart, you bought in.  And people wonder why our country is headed in the wrong idea.  Instead of getting mad at a media happy and eager to lie to you, you get mad at the result.  Instead of learning that race baiters like Jesse Jackson Jr and Al Sharpton need you to buy into racial animosity, even when it doesn't exist, to make a buck, you double down.\nWhat a shame that so many refuse to face the fact that neither Martin nor Zimmerman handled the situation properly.  What a shame that so many refuse to acknowledge the obvious fact that if this story wasn't sold to you as a sweet innocent kid being shot by a racist white guy, you not only wouldn't care, but you'd have never heard about this story.  What a shame that folks like you would be happy about this verdict, if you we're even aware of it, if Zimmerman was black and Martin had been white.\nWhat a shame indeed.\nIt's not my fault you nice folks allowed yourselves to be bamboozled by liars. It's yours.","ranges":[],"aggregatedranges":[],"hasTranslatableContent":true},"author":"565229349","ftentidentifier":"702120586484064","likecount":43,"hasviewerliked":false,"canremove":false,"canreport":false,"canedit":false,"source":1,"istranslatable":false,"timestamp":{"time":1373783576,"text":"July 13 at 11:32pm","verbose":"Saturday, July 13, 2013 at 11:32pm"},"spamreplycount":0,"replyauthors":[],"isfeatured":false,"recentreplytimestamp":{"time":1373831465,"text":"July 14 at 12:51pm","verbose":"Sunday, July 14, 2013 at 12:51pm"}},{"id":"702120586484064_106250608","fbid":"702124106483712","legacyid":"106250608","body":{"text":"The fact is: The police told the idiot to stay in his vehicle, he did not, and he came at this child waving a gun around in the dark of night.
