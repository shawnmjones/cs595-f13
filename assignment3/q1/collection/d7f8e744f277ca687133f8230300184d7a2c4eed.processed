     For apparently the first time ever in the history of the U.S. House,
     a gay member of Congress has obtained a congressional ID card
     identifying his same-sex partner as a spouse.

     Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) told the Washington Blade on Thursday the
     House Sergeant at Arms informed him late last month that Philip
     Frank, whom Pocan legally married in Canada in 2006, would be able
     to obtain an ID labeling him as congressional spouse. Previously,
     Frank was given an ID identifying him as a "designee," but picked up
     his new ID on April 26.

     National Rifle Association board member Ted Nugent detailed a plan
     for immigration reform which calls for treating undocumented
     immigrants like "indentured servants" and requiring undocumented
     male immigrants to build a fence on the United States-Mexico border.

     ... The plan would also end birthright citizenship currently
     guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. According to Nugent, "The
     anchor baby scam should be immediately rescinded. You don't need to
     be a constitutional expert like our president to know that the
     original intent of the 14th Amendment was not to provide citizenship
     to illegal women or their babies who are born on American soil."

     The bloodied remains of Solomon Manjoro were found by rangers after
     what was thought to be a botched poaching trip at the protected
     Charara safari area inside a national park. [...]

     The state-controlled Sunday Mail reported: "The poacher was recently
     trampled to death by an elephant after he failed to gun down the
     jumbo during a hunting expedition." [...]
     Police believe the pair, who were allegedly carrying unlicensed
     weapons, faced up to the beast and attempted to shoot it.
     However Manjoro was killed when the animal failed to fall and
     instead charged towards him.

       On today's [48]Kagro in the Morning show, zOMG, IRS! Greg Dworkin
       reminded us all too briefly that there are other things happening
       in the world, specifically the decision of what to do in Newtown,
       CT with the now-vacant Sandy Hook Elementary School building. After
       that, back to the IRS. We recall the Republicans' effort to "defund
       the left" with the Istoook amendment, Newt Gingrich's efforts to
       shoehorn his own political activity into a tax-exempt context, and
       the Bush administration's politicization of the US Attorneys and
       the wider DOJ. Finally, we read Daily Kos' own Jon Perr on
       "Benghazi and the Republican scandal management playbook."

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [62]Civil
   Rights, [63]Community, [64]Congress, [65]Culture, [66]Economy,
   [67]Education, [68]Elections, [69]Energy, [70]Environment, [71]Health
   Care, [72]International, [73]Labor, [74]Law, [75]Media, [76]Meta,
   [77]National Security, [78]Science, [79]Transportation, or [80]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([81]California, [82]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Some UCLA law students I know are warning about [232]this today.  Yes,
   sexual assault on college campuses is an issue, but is this the
   solution?

     WASHINGTON, May 10, 2013--In a shocking affront to the United States
     Constitution, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education have
     joined together to mandate that virtually every college and
     university in the United States establish unconstitutional speech
     codes that violate the First Amendment and decades of legal
     precedent.

     "I am appalled by this attack on free speech on campus from our own
     government," said Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for
     Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), which has been leading the
     fight against unconstitutional speech codes on America's college
     campuses since its founding in 1999. "In 2011, the Department of
     Education took a hatchet to due process protections for students
     accused of sexual misconduct. Now the Department of Education has
     enlisted the help of the Department of Justice to mandate campus
     speech codes so broad that virtually every student will regularly
     violate them. The DOE and DOJ are ignoring decades of legal
     decisions, the Constitution, and common sense, and it is time for
     colleges and the public to push back."

     In [233]a letter sent yesterday to the University of Montana that
     explicitly states that it is intended as "a blueprint for colleges
     and universities throughout the country," the Departments of Justice
     and Education have mandated a breathtakingly broad definition of
     sexual harassment that makes virtually every student in the United
     States a harasser while ignoring the First Amendment. The mandate
     applies to every college receiving federal funding--virtually every
     American institution of higher education nationwide, public or
     private.

     The letter states that "sexual harassment should be more broadly
     defined as 'any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature'" including
     "verbal conduct" (that is, speech). It then explicitly states that
     allegedly harassing expression need not even be offensive to an
     "objectively reasonable person of the same gender in the same
     situation"--if the listener takes offense to sexually related speech
     for any reason, no matter how irrationally or unreasonably, the
     speaker may be punished.

     ....

     Among the forms of expression now punishable on America's campuses
     by order of the federal government are:
     * Any expression related to sexual topics that offends any person.
       This leaves a wide range of expressive activity--a campus
       performance of "The Vagina Monologues," a presentation on safe sex
       practices, a debate about sexual morality, a discussion of gay
       marriage, or a classroom lecture on Vladimir Nabokov's
       Lolita--subject to discipline.
     * Any sexually themed joke overheard by any person who finds that
       joke offensive for any reason.
     * Any request for dates or any flirtation that is not welcomed by the
       recipient of such a request or flirtation.

   The law students seem to think the courts will very strongly strike
   this down as unconstitutional, once there is a lawsuit after someone's
   First Amendment rights are violated.

   [239]Impact of EU value for Tar Sands equal to removing up to 7 million
                      cars from Europe's roads - study

     May 7, 2013 - New evidence on the impacts of a proposed EU law
     devised to cut emissions from diesel and petrol production overturns
     claims by the oil industry that the law would not save greenhouse
     gas (GHG) emissions.

     A study conducted by two consultancies (Carbon Matters and CE Delft)
     found that the potential price differential between tar sands and
     conventional oil, resulting from differentiating them based on their
     average production emissions under the EU's Fuel Quality Directive
     (FQD), would shift investments from tar sands to lower-carbon oil
     sources, saving the planet up to 19Mt CO2 a year. This is equivalent
     to removing over 7 million cars from Europe's roads every year.

     The study was released in the same week that Canada's Natural
     Resources Minister, Joe Oliver, pays Europe a visit to again heavily
     lobby against the environmental differentiation between conventional
     and unconventional sources of oil. Canada, whose tar sands are the
     world's third-largest proven reserves of oil, vociferously opposes
     EU's climate action.

     T&E clean fuels manager Nusa Urbancic said: "Scientific studies have
     repeatedly shown that tar sands are ultra-high carbon fuels. This
     new study demonstrates that the carbon intensity values will lead to
     additional GHG savings by sending a strong signal to investors that
     fuels made from tar sands are not compatible with Europe's climate
     laws. This new piece of evidence should fuel Commission's
     determination to stick to its original proposal." [240]read more>>>
