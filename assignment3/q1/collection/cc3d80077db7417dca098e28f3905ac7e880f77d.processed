Official says Nelson Mandela on life support; Zuma cancels travel plans

   By Faith Karimi and Robyn Curnow, CNN

   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: South African president cancels Thursday's trip to Mozambique
     * Mandela is now on life support, an official says
     * Family collects some of the items left outside the hospital by
       well-wishers

   Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans lit candles outside the
   hospital where anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela lay Wednesday night
   amid a report that the former president was on life support.

   An official briefed on his condition said he was on life support, but
   government spokesman Mac Maharaj declined to comment on the report,
   citing doctor-patient confidentiality.

   Mandela, 94, considered the founding father of South Africa's
   multiracial democracy, has been hospitalized since June 8 for a
   recurring lung infection.

   Authorities have described his condition as critical since Sunday, and
   after visiting him late Wednesday night, President Jacob Zuma canceled
   his visit to Mozambique where he was supposed to attend a summit
   Thursday on infrastructure investment.

   As the nation remained on edge, police barricaded the street leading to
   the hospital's main entrance. Well-wishers hung balloons, stuffed
   animals and [41]messages of support along the wall, and crowds hovering
   nearby sang "Where is Mandela?"

   People gather and pray for Mandela
   Daughter: He is at peace
   The whole world prays for one man

   "We need you!," one sign read. "We love you tata, get well soon!" said
   another, referring to Mandela by the Xhosa word for father.

   Several relatives came out to collect some of those items Wednesday.

   "He's going to feel a lot better when he sees these signs," said David
   Manaway, Mandela's grandson-in-law.

   [42]Why Mandela has six names

   His former physician and the nation's ex-surgeon general, Dr. Vejay
   Ramlakan, also visited the hospital Wednesday, said the national news
   agency, South African Press Association.

   Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in
   prison for fighting against apartheid, the country's system of racial
   segregation. He was elected the nation's first black president in 1994,
   four years after he was freed.

   "He is our hero. He is my mentor, my father. He is everything to me,"
   said Kuda Nyahumzvi, 36. "But when it is his time, we wish his soul
   could just rest. He spent so long in jail and struggling."

   Even as he has faded from the spotlight, he remains popular and is
   considered a hero of democracy worldwide.

   As South Africans steeled themselves for the worst, details emerged
   about the family's meeting in his boyhood home of Qunu on Tuesday. An
   archbishop also stopped by the hospital and conducted prayers, calling
   for "a quiet night and a peaceful, perfect end" for the former
   president.

   Archbishop Thabo Makgoba joined the family at the hospital where
   Mandela remained in critical condition, the South African Press
   Association reported.

   "Fill them with your holy courage and the gift of trusting faith, and
   take away their fears so that they may dare to face their grief," he
   said, according to [44]a copy of the prayer posted on the bishop's
   website.

   "And uphold all of us with your steadfast love so that we may be filled
   with gratitude for all the good that he has done for us and for our
   nation, and may honor his legacy through our lives."

   During the meeting in Qunu, funeral arrangements were not part of the
   talks, family friend Bantu Holomisa said, according to SAPA.

   As a former head of state, plans for Mandela's funeral are spearheaded
   by the government, according to Holomisa.

   Mandela turns 95 in July.
