Fight against climate change blocked by Luddites at Big Oil: McQuaig

   Oil companies currently have proven reserves of oil, gas and coal worth

   In the interest of fighting climate change, most of us avoid buying
   SUVs -- fortress-like vehicles that aren't necessary unless one intends
   to take the whole family for a spin through downtown Baghdad.

   Most of us also recycle and keep the thermostat low. However, these
   gestures are doing almost nothing to stop the warming of the planet.

   Yet climate change has disappeared from the political agenda. While the
   media diligently scrutinize the security risk posed by a hot
   relationship between a general and his biographer, there's little
   airtime to consider the security risk posed by something even hotter:
   the planet. (A Pentagon-commissioned study in 2003 concluded that
   global warming would lead to brutal storms, flooding, drought and
   widespread human strife. "Once again, warfare would define human life."
   But back to the general . . .)

   The news on the climate front is devastating.

   In a report earlier this month, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), one of
   the world's largest accounting firms, states the world has "passed the
   critical threshold" and that current carbon reductions amount to "a
   fraction of what is required against the international commitment to
   limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius."

   In order to keep within that limit by 2050, the accounting firm says
   the world will have to dramatically accelerate its annual pace of
   carbon reduction -- to a rate never before achieved, and then continue
   at that rate "for 39 consecutive years." No problem!

   That's if we want to keep warming to just 2 degrees Celsius -- which
   may be too high. So far, we've warmed the planet by only 0.8 degrees
   Celsius -- and yet that little bit of warming packs quite a punch, as
   the U.S. east coast learned last month.

   The PwC report notes that, at current rates, we're headed for 6 degrees
   of warming by the end of the century.

   Yet this alarming news was barely reported. The media apparently didn't
   think it necessary to inform us that the Earth has basically been
   tossed onto the barbecue.

   The good news is, with great effort, we can still turn things around.
   But blocking the path to a green future are the world's most powerful
   corporations, whose phenomenal wealth derives from selling the very
   fossil fuels that are driving up the temperature.

   In a [81]brilliant article in Rolling Stone, Bill McKibben sets out
   exactly why Big Oil and the rest of the fossil fuel industry so
   fiercely resist action to tackle climate change.

   The companies currently have proven reserves of oil, gas and coal worth
   $27 trillion.

   If the world were to reduce carbon emissions enough to keep the
   temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius, 80 per cent of those
   reserves would have to stay in the ground! McKibben notes that this
   means the fossil fuel industry would "be writing off $20 trillion in
   assets" -- not something corporate moguls do, especially when it
   involves their core business.

   As author Naomi Klein puts it, "With the fossil-fuel industry, wrecking
   the planet is their business model. It's what they do."

   One proposed solution is a "fee-and-dividend" scheme, which would
   heavily tax fossil fuels and then return the revenue to the entire
   population by monthly cheque, encouraging everyone to save money by
   switching to cleaner energy.

   This would help the public transition to a greener economy. But it
   wouldn't help Big Oil, whose executives would remain hell-bent on
   stopping the march of progress -- just as 19th-century textile workers
   fiercely resisted being replaced by spinning machines.

   While those workers angrily smashed the machines, the world moved on to
   a prosperous new era of large-scale factory production, enabling the
   public to enjoy brightly coloured cotton calicoes and a popular social
   event known as the calico ball.

   The workers, dubbed Luddites, paid a heavy price for their resistance.
   They were executed for destroying the machines, and have been ridiculed
   throughout history.

   By contrast, the Luddites running Big Oil are enjoying the biggest
   bonanza in history, even as they block the saving of the planet -- a
   more grievous offence, by any reckoning, than denying the world the
   benefits of the spinning machine or even the calico ball.
