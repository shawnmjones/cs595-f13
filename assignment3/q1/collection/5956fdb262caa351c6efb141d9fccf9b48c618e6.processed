   Was it a Good Friday...or a GREAT Friday?
     * California's economy [29]continues to recover:

     SACRAMENTO, Calif.--California's jobless rate dipped to 9.6 percent
     last month, the lowest rate since December 2008 when the nation was
     gripped by the financial crisis, state officials announced Friday.

     The state's Employment Development Department reported California
     added 293,800 jobs in the past 12 months for a 2.1 percent gain.
     That outpaces the national job growth of 1.5 percent, keeping the
     state ahead for 2013 despite its slowly declining unemployment rate.
     The statewide unemployment rate fell from 9.8 percent in January
     after dropping below double digits this past winter.
     "After a long recession and housing crisis in which the state lagged
     the nation in job growth, California is once again one of the
     nation's job growth leaders," wrote Stephen Levy, director and
     senior economist at the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study
     of the California Economy, in his assessment of the latest
     employment figures.
       Texas conservatives everywhere just had their heads explode.
     * North Korea's full [30]statement of war against the United States
       and South Korea. Not that this is really different from any other
       day.
     * Who knew? Obamacare will actually cost fast food companies [31]much
       less than anticipated:

     Fast food chains have been some of Obamacare's biggest critics,
     issuing warnings of new surcharges, higher costs, and laid-off
     workers because of the health reform law. Many of them have now
     changed their thinking. By the new estimates from several chains --
     including Wendy's, Popeye's, Jack in the Box, and Chipotle --
     Obamacare will actually cost about 80 percent less than they
     originally warned.

     Those include companies whose franchises have already taken
     preemptive action to avoid providing their employees with health
     coverage, including one Nebraska Wendy's chain.
     * No, vaccines are [32]NOT giving kids autism.
     * This is straight out of the weird files. A Nevada State Legislator
       who was voted out of the body for making threats against his
       colleagues [33]finished the day by leading police on a high-speed
       chase.
     * Steve King: [34]Still an asshole.
     * I don't even know where to get started with [35]this:

     A Tarrant County Republican activist has a new idea for a club at
     Tarrant County Colleges: a student union to celebrate and promote
     white interests.

     Richard Railey, a 56-year-old seeking an Associate of Applied
     Science in IT, calls himself "Mstr Rick" and is currently seeking a
     school charter for the White Student Union of Tarrant County
     Colleges. On its website, Railey deems the group "a confederacy of
     like minds united in pursuit of common political, cultural,
     educational, and social interests relative to our unique White
     Heritage". In the past, the Tarrant County GOP has appointed Railey
     as an election judge and elected him as a precinct chairman.
       Point one: hey, no, the Republican Party isn't racist at all! Point
       two: I'm sure the use of the word "confederacy" to describe his
       group was entirely coincidental.
     * [36]Jim Carrey vs. Fox News and the NRA. I think Jim Carrey wins
       this round.
     * The general election in the race of Mayor of Los Angeles will take
       place on May 21, with former City Council President Eric Garcetti
       and City Controller Wendy Greuel vying to succeed termed-out mayor
       Antonio Villaraigosa. Garcetti won the primary by four points, and
       a [37]new poll shows him with a significant lead heading into the
       general election.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [48]Tagging tips - [49]Search For Tags - [50]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   allowing businesses to regulate which bathroom transgender people can
   use. Yep, Rep. Kavanaugh is all about jobs! "Shame! Shame!"

     Republican Representative John Kavanagh's newest effort to regulate
     toilet usage in Arizona, by proposing that businesses can dictate
     which bathroom transgender people can use, cleared its first hurdle
     at the Legislature on Wednesday.

     With that, the scores of people who spent nearly two hours
     testifying on Kavanagh's proposal -- all but one of them speaking
     out against the amendment -- and ended the committee hearing with a
     chant of "shame" directed at Kavanagh and his Republican colleagues.

 Another fun fact ([206]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [207]moderatemajority

       Cost of living in California is about 50% higher than in texas, yet
       minimum wage, at best, is only 10% higher.  If we look at two large
       cities, Los Angeles and Houston, for instance, we see one aspect of
       that inequity.  A person can to and from work for $2.50.  No jokes,
       I took the bus for years and still take it when I go for training.
        In Los Angeles the charge is $3.  I think $2.50 is too high.  $3,
       for part time minimum wage, is 10%.

 Unemployment lower in Bay Area ([215]2+ / 0-)

   If say you're talking about areas down in El Centro and Imperial, then

   However, the Bay Area's unemployment rate is lowering faster than other
   parts of the state, particularly in San Francisco which right now is
   going through a major transformation.

 Right but my argument was about the Bay Area ([225]2+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [226]Pam from Calif, [227]Glen The Plumber

       The Bay Area region consists of a considerable population in the
       state of California.  San Francisco, as you pointed out, is only a
       small part of California.
       Therefore, when I made the argument over the Bay Area as having
       lower unemployment compared to other parts of California, I was

 I once worked for a large company ([242]0+ / 0-)
       That supported various internal interest groups (I suppose you
       could call them "clubs"). There were a wide variety ranging from
       people who played bridge or chess or ultimate frisbee to gay
       employees, Asian-American employees, mothers of toddlers,
       recovering alcoholics, and so on. It was fairly benign -- each
       group met once a month or once a week and had a group mailing list
       for sending emails. Sometimes the company let the groups use an
       empty meeting room or even chipped in a few bucks for softball
       equipment or the city's gay pride parade or whatever.
       At this company there was a guy who wanted to start a group called
       something like "Straight white males," to fight against the evil
       discrimination against straight white guys. Yeah, right. He'd send
       out emails and put notices up to get people to join his pathetic
       club. Nobody took him seriously.

     The provisions of this chapter, as they relate to procuring licenses

     a denomination having an unusual mode of entering the marriage
     relation.
       In addition, Iowa recognizes common law marriage and recognizes
       that the laws concerning marriage licenses, tc., are directory and
       not mandatory.  [262]LEGISLATIVE GUIDE TO MARRIAGE LAW (at P. 14):

     Common law marriage in Iowa has been recognized for over a century.
      However, no public policy exists in Iowa favoring common law
     marriage. As in other states, the Iowa Supreme Court has interpreted
     the statutes regulating marriage, in keeping with Meister, to be
     merely directory such that a marriage contracted in violation of the
     statutory provisions, such as common law marriage, does not
     invalidate a marriage, even if there are penalties for those who do
     not comply with the statutory requirements

 TP:Why Rich People Hate Talking About Inequality ([306]0+ / 0-)

   [307]http://thinkprogress.org/...

     Ed. note: This is the third and final post in a TP Ideas symposium
     on Branko Milanovic's The Haves and the Have-Nots: A Brief and
     Idiosyncratic History of Global Inequality. The first installment is
     here here and the second is here.

     The wealthy don't like it when we talk about it inequality. Mitt
     Romney famously labeled President Obama's critique of inequality
     "class warfare" motivated by "envy," and proposed instead that
     debate about economic inequality be confined to "quiet rooms." It's
     fair to say he's not alone among the super-wealthy in thinking this
     isn't a "proper" subject for open, political debate.

     At first blush, their motivation here is straightforward: it could
     cost them money. But given America's one percent already has so
     much, and so little redistribution is on the table, they'd have to
     be exceptionally greedy to have such a strong reaction to even
     broaching the inequality discussion. Of course that's possible, but
     the history of debates around inequality as surveyed in Branko
     Milanovic's wonderfully readable book suggests another explanation.
     The rich don't like inequality talk because, by its very nature, it
     involves making moral judgments about the way the rich live their
     lives into a topic for public discussion.

     In the book's first essay, "Unequal People," Milanovic runs down the
     earliest modern economic theories about whether inequality is good
     for economic growth. The difference between early theories wasn't,
     as we think today, whether or not you thought inequality was
     something that happened as a consequence of a roaring economy: it
     was whether, essentially, the rich are good people or not.

 STUDY:Chain Drug Stores Selling Generics 18xCost ([310]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   [312]http://thinkprogress.org/...

     STUDY: CVS, Rite Aid, And Other Chain Pharmacies Sell Generic Drugs
     At Up To 18 Times Their Cost

     According to a new Consumer Reports investigative study published
     Thursday, there is rampant variation in the price of generic drugs
     as large U.S. pharmacy chains -- including CVS, Rite Aid, and Target
     -- mark up the prices of generic drug versions for common
     medications by as much as 18 times what wholesale chains like Costco
     charge. That price variance ends up costing Americans, who spend an
     average of $758 out-of-pocket on drugs every year, hundreds of
     dollars in unnecessary spending each month.

     Consumer Reports compiled the data by contacting hundred of
     pharmacies throughout the country and asking what their drug prices
     were for generic versions of Lipitor, Plavix, Actos, and other
     common medications. The results were striking, with pharmacy
     representatives claiming that the higher prices were necessary for
     covering overhead, and considering that selling medication
     constitutes most of their revenue and profit margins:

        Costco was the least expensive overall, and you don't need to be
     a member to use its pharmacy. A few independent pharmacies came in
     even cheaper, though their prices varied widely, as did
     grocery-store pharmacies. The online retailers Healthwarehouse.com
     and FamilyMeds.com also had very low prices. On the other end of the
     spectrum, CVS, Rite Aid, and Target had the highest retail prices.
     [...]

         A representative of CVS told us that its retail drug prices
     reflect other services offered by the chain, including drive-through
     windows, automated prescription refill systems, free outreach
     programs to help make sure patients are taking their prescriptions
     correctly, and 24-hour pharmacies. Costco pharmacies, the cheapest
     overall, are open only from 10 a.m. to 7 or 8:30 p.m. and are
     typically closed on Sundays.

         "Big-box stores such as Costco and Walmart use the pharmacy as a
     traffic builder for their stores, whereas traditional chain stores,
     such as CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens, make the majority of their
     revenue and profits from the pharmacy," says Stephen W.
     Schondelmeyer, Ph.D., Pharm.D., a professor of pharmacy economics at
     the University of Minnesota.

     Inside Obama's Syria Debate

     [324]http://online.wsj.com/...

     Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came to believe late last
     year that Washington could no longer watch the Syria carnage from
     the sidelines. But Mrs. Clinton and other advocates of arming the
     rebels didn't in the end aggressively push for the initiative, put
     forward by then-Central Intelligence Agency Director David Petraeus,
     as it became clear where Mr. Obama stood, according to current and
     former administration officials.

     Arming Syrian rebels divided the cabinet coalition that had
     championed the 2011 Libya campaign, pitting Mrs. Clinton against
     U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice who emerged as a leading voice of
     caution.

     ......

     Mr. Petraeus, leaning forward during his presentation, made a
     forceful case for arming rebels, arguing it would help the U.S.
     build pro-Western allies and shape future leaders of a post-Assad
     Syria.

     Mrs. Clinton spoke in favor of the initiative but her remarks were
     brief. U.N. Ambassador Rice argued strongly against arming the
     rebels, citing doubts about the opposition. Ms. Rice through a
     spokeswoman declined to comment.

 Knock me over with a feather! ([342]0+ / 0-)

   Robert Reich is hearing that Obama plans to call for a "chained-CPI"
   for Social Security in his April 10 budget:

     Word from my moles in the White House is the President will be
     calling for a "chained-CPI" for Social Security in his April 10
     budget. That's a lower inflation adjustment than currently --
     meaning future Social Security recipients will be getting far less
     than otherwise, especially when compounded over their retirement
     years. This makes no sense either politically or economically.
     Politically it's absurd for the President to offer the Republicans a
     concession on the budget they haven't even asked for, before
     bargaining has even begun, and which most Americans -- who have paid
     into Social Security for years -- will oppose. Economically it makes
     no sense because the typical senior spends 20 to 40 percent of his
     or her income on health care, whose costs have been rising far
     faster than inflation -- meaning even the current inflation
     adjustment understates the true needs of seniors.

     I hope you have a restful weekend.
