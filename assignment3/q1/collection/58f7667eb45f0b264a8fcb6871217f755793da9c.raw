<b>Leading Off</b>:
<p>• <b>NH-Sen</b>: This sounds like something that was supposed to come out on April Fool's Day but got stuck in the pipeline. Scott Brown, the former half-term Republican senator from Massachusetts, is floating his name for a new Senate race... <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/04/04/former-mass-senator-not-ruling-out-run/mXQWZCDwOIBg4q8lmjnHDM/story.html">in New Hampshire</a>. It's not entirely clear whether he brought up the idea himself, or if someone else prompted the question after he stated at a New Hampshire appearance on Thursday that he was "likely not done with politics," but in either case, he said he's "not going to rule out anything right now."</p>
<p>My assumption based on his most recent moves—such as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/04/01/scott-brown-filling-in-for-bill-oreilly/">filling in for Bill O'Reilly</a> on Fox News the other day—was that he wasn't going to run for anything in 2014, including the most obvious choice of MA-Gov (the one slot where Bay Staters have shown some willingness to vote Republican).</p>
<p>But Brown may well truly want to find a way back into the Senate, whatever the method. With that in mind, New Hampshire does have a 2014 race for a Dem-held seat; the swingy Granite State is more receptive to moderate Republicanism than Massachusetts; and most of New Hampshire shares a media market with Boston, so name rec shouldn't be a problem. (In fact, a good number of people who work in Boston and would actually like to vote for Brown probably already live one state to the north: ex-Massholes who have fled the state for the lure of lower taxes.) However, that would put him on a collision course with Jeanne Shaheen, who's no pushover. She's one of New Hampshire's most popular politicians and is favored for re-election—though a Brown candidacy would certainly scramble the calculus.</p>
<p>So the next logical question is: "If the stars align in such a bizarre way to elect Scott Brown again, would that make him the first-ever senator to represent two different states?" The answer, in fact, is no, not by a long shot. Several senators have already done that—perhaps most famously Daniel Webster, who represented the exact same two states in question (though he served New Hampshire in the House). Indeed, one senator, <a href="http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senator_for_three_states.htm">James Shields</a>, represented <em>three</em> different states (Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri) in the Senate between 1849 and 1879. But this practice has become increasingly rare (in the House, for instance, it was only accomplished <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2011/05/dennis_kucinich_reelection_sch.php">three times</a> in the 20th century), so Brown would find himself in extremely unusual territory if he went ahead with such a move.</p>

<p><b>Senate</b>:</p>
<p>• <b>IA-Sen</b>: With each passing week, it seems like Republican Rep. Steve King's feet get a little colder regarding the open Iowa Senate seat, which would at least potentially be winnable for a skilled moderate Republican but would be a kamikaze mission for a nutter like him. King even acknowledged his own difficulties in recent comments on Iowa public TV, saying it would be a "<a href="https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/320194501798932480">slightly uphill battle</a>" for him since Iowa's "turned a little to the left." <a href="https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/320194123724378112">He added</a> that "I need to get a decision made pretty quickly" out of respect for other potential GOP candidates Kim Reynolds and Bill Northey. Cumulatively, those quotes don't make him sound very candidate-ish.</p>
<p>• <b>MA-Sen</b>: This may be too little too late for Stephen Lynch, who staked out the right flank in the Democratic primary for the Massachusetts Senate special election and is now finding out that there just aren't enough votes there for a path to victory. Lynch is now toying with <a href="http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/04/democratic_senate_candidate_st_1.html">flip-flopping on his support</a> for the Keystone XL pipeline, which is one of the key differences he has with Ed Markey and also one of the main reasons why major enviro groups are backing Markey instead. Maybe most significantly, environmental issues are what's driven billionaire Tom Steyer to spend over $200,000 so far on defeating Lynch.</p>
<p>At this point, Lynch has only opened the door to dropping support for the pipeline and hasn't formally reversed course, but even if he did, the special primary is coming up soon (April 30), and his die is already cast as the less-eco-friendly candidate. It also might diminish enthusiasm for him from the hard-hat unions, many of which support the pipeline construction from a jobs-and-infrastructure angle. It's really a no-win situation for Lynch... but then, it's been one ever since he inexplicably got in the race in the first place.</p>
<p>• <b>MI-Sen</b>: Debbie Dingell is reportedly taking "<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/debbie-dingell-michigan-senate-89670.html">concrete steps</a>" toward a Senate run to replace the retiring Carl Levin, according to Politico. While Dingell—the wife of Rep. John Dingell, who hasn't held political office but is a Dem insider in her own right and a former General Motors exec—says that she's still "genuinely undecided," she is doing her due diligence. That means putting together a consulting team featuring a couple of big names and meeting with labor groups and EMILY's List (the latter of whom would probably be key to her winning a primary against Rep. Gary Peters). (Also, check out the picture of her at the link... she also seems to be working on her <a href="http://dealbreaker.com/uploads/2013/03/carllevin.jpg">Carl Levin-style look</a>, at least in terms of her eyeglasses and facial expression.)</p>
<p>• <b>NJ-Sen</b>: Don't start coronating Cory Booker for the open New Jersey Senate seat just yet: Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone just popped up again to remind us that he's "<a href="http://blogs.app.com/capitolquickies/2013/04/04/pallone-very-interested-in-u-s-senate-seat/">very interested</a>" in the race. We haven't heard much from Pallone since his name first got floated in the wake of Frank Lautenberg's retirement, but this is probably his strongest statement of interest so far, saying he's "pursuing that and working on it on a daily basis." Booker's star power will be difficult to overcome, but it seems like Pallone's gauging whether there's enough space on Booker's left to carve out a viable path to the nomination.</p>
<p><b>Gubernatorial</b>:</p>
<p>• <b>IL-Gov</b>: Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn doesn't seem to grok that his approvals have him down in dead-candidate-walking territory, such that he might actually be at risk of losing to a Republican in this blue state (not that it really matters since he'd probably be just a speed bump for AG Lisa Madigan in a Democratic primary). Yet Quinn's actions indicate that he's still fully intending to run for re-election, since he's going <a href="http://capitolfax.com/2013/04/05/quinn-raised-half-a-million-last-month/">full speed ahead</a> on the fundraising front. After ending 2012 with only about $1 million in campaign funds, he raised $550,000 in the first quarter of the year, with much of that coming from organized labor.</p>
<p><b>House</b>:</p>
<p>• <b>CA-20</b>: Nothing says pure excitement more than "Leon Panetta." But now that he seems to have retired for good after holding every single possible job in the Beltway at various points, it's time for... <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/post/panetta-political-dynasty-taking-shape/2013/04/05/9d9ee76a-9e08-11e2-a941-a19bce7af755_blog.html">another Panetta</a>. Leon's son James, a Monterey County assistant DA and a former Naval Intelligence officer, is floating his name for the House seat held long ago by his dad, once Sam Farr (who took over in 1993 after Panetta left to head OMB) retires. One slight catch: Farr hasn't expressed any interest in actually, you know, retiring, though he is 71 years old.</p>
<p><b>Other Races</b>:</p>
<p>• <b>Charlotte Mayor</b>: When I saw "Foxx" and "North Carolina" in one place, my first instinct was that Virginia Foxx was retiring! Unfortunately, we aren't so lucky. Instead, Anthony Foxx, the up-and-coming mayor of Charlotte, announced that he <a href="http://projects.newsobserver.com/node/27287">won't be running</a> for re-election this year. Foxx, who is African-American and 41 years old, was first elected in 2009. He's gotten mostly good notices as mayor, so it's not a question of being endangered. Rather, recent scuttlebutt has him on the short list to become Transportation secretary in Barack Obama's second term, so an announcement on that may be forthcoming soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/04/05/3961761/who-will-replace-anthony-foxx.html">Possible Democratic candidates</a> here include Jennifer Roberts, the Mecklenburg County Commissioner who acquitted herself well in the open seat NC-09 race last year; City Councilor and Mayor-pro-tem Patrick Cannon; City Councilor David Howard; and state Sen. Dan Clodfelter. On the Republican side, ex-City Councilor and 2009 loser John Lassiter may try again, and City Councilor Edwin Peacock could also run.</p>
<p><b>Grab Bag</b>:</p>
<p>• <b>House</b>: Maybe it was last week's Quinnipiac poll (which had a generic ballot of D+8) that suddenly got everyone to realize that polls are showing the Democrats hovering around the point where, if the numbers hold up, they might retake control of the House in 2014. (Rasmussen, weirdly, has been putting up those kinds of numbers routinely for months now, though I certainly won't fault you for not wanting to hang your hat entirely on Scotty's predictions.)</p>
<p>Think Progress's Ian Millhiser concludes, based on 2012 margins in individual House races, that Democrats would win a <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/04/03/1816631/if-election-were-held-today-democrats-would-win-house-in-a-landslide-and-only-win-a-5-seat-majority/">five-seat majority</a> if this D+8 margin held, while other pundits have looked instead at <a href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/midterm-forecast-democrats-may-gain-house-seats-in-2014-but-majority-probably-out-of-reach/">Alan Abramowitz's model</a>, which would require an ungodly D+13 on the generic ballot to flip the House.</p>
<p>The New Republic's Nate Cohn came out with a <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112841/election-2014-gerrymandering-wont-doom-dems">characteristically judicious piece</a> on Friday, skeptical of whether the outlier-ish Quinnipiac poll of registered voters is that reliable, but also supposing that it would take significantly less than D+8 to flip the House. That's based on the role of open seats but also more generally on the lack of a uniform swing (as seen in the general trend that seats on the cusp mostly tend to fall in the same direction amidst a wave year).</p>
<p>However, as a final splash of cold water, there's also the wee matter, of course, of whether the Dems can actually sustain a D+8 for the next year and a half. Kyle Kondik <a href="https://twitter.com/kkondik/status/320206324413648896">points out</a> that at this point in 2009, the generic ballot was running at D+4! (And we know how that movie turned out.)</p>

		<p><b>More Tagging tips:</b></p>
		<p>A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?</p>
		<p>Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.</p>
		<p>If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. 
		CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.</p>
		<p>Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful.</p>

<p>if you have no income or sales tax in NH, but want a functioning school system and local government, as most border towns do. Propaganda to the contrary, the basic rule that public services have to be paid for continues to apply, even within the sainted boundaries of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>About 2 years ago I was stuck with a guy from Wakefield at a party. He kept telling me how Obama was a socialist and he was moving to NH to get away from taxes in Mass. I asked if he was planning to give up his job two blocks from North Station as part of this plan. "No," he says, "I have a great job in Boston. Why would I do that?"</p>
<p>Because, dumbass, if you continue to work in Mass. you'll pay Mass. income tax ANYWAY, plus double the property tax, and you'll triple your commute. But otherwise, good plan.</p>

<p>In CA we &nbsp;have just about the lowest property taxes in the US with most homeowners paying just 1% on the purchase price, plus a tiny raise each year if the house appreciates. We also have among the highest sales and personal income taxes in the nation. Ideally there should be balance, because as it is low incomes are way over paying in sales and income taxes while the rich and businesses shield their valuable property from taxes.</p>

<p>I can imagine the national GOP, Koch Brothers, et al, salivating at flipping a Senate seat especially if it means taking out one of the more effective and experienced Dems. And it would really help their image with female voters (not. . . ).</p>

<p>OK...so we learned last week Kevin Strouse is a candidate for PA-08. And today we learn he is still doing research to form <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-push-problem-solvers-in-house-contests/2013/04/06/16c02154-9bde-11e2-9a79-eb5280c81c63_story.html">opinions on the issues</a>.</p>
<p>First of all if he was not ready to formulate opinions in the issues, maybe he could have waited 6 months before announcing his candidacy and giving an embarrassing interview to the Washington Post. Of course WaPo is in love with the centrist gobbledygook; apparently Democrats' new branding strategy is "polite problem-solvers" (gag!), so this is all framed as a positive for Strouse.</p>
<p>As I have said repeatedly here, moderates are fine and centrists are shysters. It is legitimate for congresscritters to genuinely hold moderate beliefs (moderates), &nbsp;but it is not OK for congresscritters to compromise for the sake of compromising whatever the policy consequences (centrists).</p>

<p>My home state of New Hampshire has a semi-open primary: independents (whom we Granite Staters call "Undeclareds") can vote in either primary. &nbsp;An undeclared has the right to join one party or the other for at least the few minutes it takes to fill out the ballot. Sometimes they forget to change back to Undeclared (which they can do after they hand in their ballots) and end up being stuck for two years in a party they only wanted to join for those few minutes. &nbsp;In 2014, we will probably have more accidental Republicans than accidental Democrats, thanks to the 2012 Presidential Primary (although the Democratic state primary did feature a lively governor's race.)</p>
<p>NH is famous for the First in the Nation Presidential Primary, but it has one of the latest state primaries. &nbsp;Unless the legislature changes the election laws (unlikely though not inconceivable) the primary date is the second Tuesday of each even-numbered year, i.e. September 9, 2014. &nbsp;This makes for a rather short general election campaign: usually eight weeks (and every 14th year we have a 7-week general election campaign.)</p>

<p>will be no small task. But how would it affect the political calculus if the GOP was reduced to a very slim majority? Say the hold the House by just 3 or 4 seats. Would the GOP dig in deeper and fight even harder or would it give the few remaining "moderate" Republicans a reason to start acting rationally? Either way, I think Boehner loses the speakership after 2014, either to a Democrat (who will not be Nancy Pelosi, IMO) or a more conservative Republican.</p>

<p>She's been the Democratic leader for a while, sure, but she doesn't lack for energy, hasn't made any big mistakes, and I don't see any agitation in the caucus that her time is up. &nbsp;Right now, it seems like the job is hers until she decides.</p>
<p>But if she didn't step aside after this last election, let alone after 2010, is she really likely to do so just when she'd have the chance to be Speaker again? &nbsp;(...and with a Democratic Senate and President! I'm pretty sure she would like to finally get a climate bill signed, for instance.)</p>
<p>I completely agree with you about Boehner, though; this is the end of the line for him. &nbsp;Speaker or no, if they lose seats in 2014 he will not be keeping the wolves out any longer. &nbsp;<em>Maybe</em> if they gained seats (avert), but I'd be doubtful even then. &nbsp;</p>

<p>though he's obviously exaggerating in calling Brown's 2012 run "the worst campaign in the history of man". &nbsp;I don't know who has that title, but it seems that Martha Coakley after winning the special election primary comes closer than Brown's effort. &nbsp;With a better Coakley campaign, we probably wouldn't even be talking about Brown now.</p>
<p>And nice that Pierce pointed out that Brown got the NH idea in his head after attending a dinner honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. &nbsp;I'm sure we all agree with Pierce that "when I think of Dr. King's legacy, the first person I think of is Scott Brown." &nbsp;ROTFLOL.</p>

<p>It is true that NH has many former Mass. residents. However, Snottie Brown will be making a serious miscalculation that he is electable in the Granite State. For one thing, the guano crazy Ron Paul wing of the GOP is strong in NH (see NH GOP lawmakers attempt to base laws on the Magna Carta). People in NH don't like pathological liars either witnessed by Brown claiming he was born at the Portsmouth Naval Yard, which BTW is technically in Maine and not NH. Really? Your mother was some kind of worker at the PNY and you were born on its premises. Yeah right. It's not like Snottie hasn't told whoppers like this before like when he said in a debate with Elizabeth Warren that he had been defending women since he was six years old.</p>

<p>The biggest single issue is the budget, and that feeds multiple side issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Quinn_%28politician%29">Quinn</a> championed doubling the corporate tax rate to 7% and increasing the Illinois personal income tax rate from 3% to 5% to balance the budget. &nbsp;That passed the legislature. &nbsp;Guess whether the budget is balanced? &nbsp;People are rightly pissed off that a big promise was not delivered.</p>
<p>That leads into the second biggest issue - his fight with AFSCME over the state worker contract. &nbsp;IMHO, AFSCME is not covered in glory here either - they struck for and got guaranteed 4% raises in 2008 - a year when people were pretty raw over losing jobs left and right. &nbsp;This fed a "unions suck" mentality. &nbsp;Quinn by any standard has deeply fucked up the <a href="http://www.capitolfax.com/2012/11/20/this-just-in-afscme-quinn-terminates-union-contract/">renegotiation</a>. &nbsp;Remember how the budget wasn't balanced?</p>
<p>The state pension plan has been explicitly underfunded by all governors for decades. &nbsp;The fact that this policy is bipartisan and longstanding does not stop it from crushing the current occupant of the seat. &nbsp;Illinois is short <a href="http://articles.marketwatch.com/2013-03-13/commentary/37665618_1_pension-python-pension-problems-pension-shortfall">97B</a> from what they should have. &nbsp;Notice how the SEC also called them out for misleading bond incvestors.</p>
<p>So the short answer is that on the one thing that he <strong>HAD</strong> to do - balance the budget, he deeply fucked it up, and that shit is splashing everywhere.</p>

<p>to a Republican Governor than a Republican Senator. Between 1991 and 2007, literally every Governor of Massachusetts was a Republican. Before Brown's victory in 2010, the last time a Republican won a Senate election in MA was Ed Brooke in 1972.</p>
<p>There is a theory that many in MA like the idea of a Republican Governor to balance out the heavily Democratic legislature. Scott Brown being a supposed "moderate" would fit that perfectly.</p>

<p>But it is pretty obvious that Scott Brown isn't really a nose to the grindstone governor type. He's more celebrity Senator. I think he knows that.<br />
Was this all just a case of, "hey the governorship will be open; Scott Brown isn't doing anything, I bet he'll run"?<br />
Pretty lazy speculation there that can really be made only by someone who hasn't watched Brown in action.<br />
Given the choice of running a state or being a Fox celebrity and part-time celebrity lawyer, my analysis always said Brown would take the easy way out.</p>

<p>...has there ever been a U.S. Senator who lost reelection in one state and later was elected to the Senate from another?</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge that has not occurred. Not that it matters, per se.</p>
<p>However, as a New Yorker who supported Hillary Clinton's run for Senate, despite charges against her of being a "carpetbagger," it seems to me that Brown has a lot more to overcome than just being called a "carpetbagger."<br />
He would also have to overcome the additional baggage that he was a carpetbagger who was fired from office by his own constituents.</p>
<p>In fact, the ad makes itself (for the Democratic candidate):<br />
Why would New Hampshire want to send someone to the U.S. Senate who was fired from his job as Senator by his previous constituents? Maybe he thinks our standards are lower here?</p>
