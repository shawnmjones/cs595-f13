   Surrounded by Newtown family members, President Obama gave a speech
   this afternoon angrily denouncing Senate inability to pass meaningful
   gun safety legislation, in particular the Manchin-Toomey amendment to
   strengthen the current system of background checks. "All in all, this
   was a pretty shameful day for Washington."

   He also promised that today's votes were "just round one" of the
   ongoing fight for gun reform:

     "[T]he fact is most of these senators could not offer any good
     reason why we wouldn't want to make it harder for criminals and
     those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun.  There were no
     coherent arguments as to why we wouldn't do this.  It came down to
     politics." [...]

     "To all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement
     and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms,
     rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your
     representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that
     if they don't act this time, you will remember come election time."

   A full transcript of his remarks can be found [30]here.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       There is a loophole the size of Crater Lake in the bill, about
       national gun registry. ONLY the Attorney General is prohibited from
       creating a gun registry, and ONLY data from active FFL dealers is
       prohibited from inclusion in the registry, should such a registry
       be ceated by anyone other than the AG (HHS, for example).
       Obama lied in the press conference.

   This is messed up logic that will mean more death.

   This country is fucked up about their guns - the twisting of the second
   amendment, the lies about the the truths ... I am so sick and tired of
   this need for men to compensate with big guns and women who want to
   feel powerful.

   This whole thing is so disappointing.

       thing.
       So I think you have an outlier there. And just because someone may

       job.

 Here's the text of the loophole ([311]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [312]PavePusher

     (c) Prohibition of National Gun Registry.-Section 923 of title 18,
     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
      "(m) The Attorney General may not consolidate or centralize the
     records of the
      "(1) acquisition or disposition of firearms, or any portion
     thereof, maintained by
      "(A) a person with a valid, current license under this chapter;
      "(B) an unlicensed transferor under section 922(t); or
      "(2) possession or ownership of a firearm, maintained by any
     medical or health insurance entity.".
       See the bold text? Everything in the universe outside these two
       items is fine for creating the registry. BTW all FFL dealers are
       required to submit last 20 years worth of records to the AG if they
       go inactive or retire or lose their FF license for some reason.

       I listened to he and Manchin explain it. You are both missing the
       point.
       Sure, the amendment bars a national registry. Whatever.
       A national registry was never, ever on the table anyway!
       It was not ever even considered by anyone.
       The is a tempest in a cracked teapot.
       Who cares if they ban putting buyers of TV dinners in a national
       registry?
       That was never part of any discussion.
       Good job, NRA.

   I would call it an excercise in futility except that it is going to
   turn many of the purple states back to bright red for 2014.  Obama is
   doing everything he can to destroy any liberal or progressive leanings
   in the Democratic Party.  The Republicans here are going stark staring
   crazy.  One of my sons, who hob nobs with the gun crowd, says they are
   nuts, and there isn't any ammo or guns on the shelves at the local gun
   stores.

   Obama's OFA will make sure they back "moderate" Democrats in 2014, read
   that as Republicans.  We have been had in a big way and unless the
   Democrats in Congress break with Obama right now, we and they will pay

       General, her campaign for the Senate in 2012 and her first and
       strongest action as a US Senator was focused on the re-instatement
       of the Violence Against Women Act. Domestic violence prevention and
       appropriate law enforcement response was one of the things she put
       in place as ND Attorney General in the 90's. Her first big
       state-wide campaign tour was visiting Social Service Agencies to
       draw attention to that federal legislation and how it helps women.
        Then, when she got to Washington, she focused like a lazer on the
       VAWA and worked hard to get that victory.
       Yet she seems to ignore completely the problem of women being
       killed by spouses or partners with guns. It's hard for me to
       imagine she doesn't know this and it is that fact that makes
       today's vote so very disappointing to Heitkamp supporters.

       From the Toomey-Manchin Amendment:

     (c) Prohibition of National Gun Registry.-Section 923 of title 18,
     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
       "(m) The Attorney General may not consolidate or centralize the
     records of the
       "(1) acquisition or disposition of firearms, or any portion
     thereof, maintained by
       "(A) a person with a valid, current license under this chapter;
       "(B) an unlicensed transferor under section 922(t); or
       "(2) possession or ownership of a firearm, maintained by any
     medical or health insurance entity.".
       Only the AG is prohibited from creating the registry, and the only
       data prohibited from inclusion in the registry is that possessed by
       current, active FFLs.
       That's the big loophole. DHS could create a registry, so could HHS
       under Obamacare, and plenty of data (eventually all of it, since
       FFLs need to turn over their records to the govt when no longer
       licensed/retired/suspended) will be fair game.

     But instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its
     allies willfully lied about the bill.

   That's stronger than the usual politically correct u-word.

     And unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this
     legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense
     minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of
     senators.

   In the middle of his remarks, as I was listening to this live, this
   fundamental truth stood out:

     And this legislation met that test.  And too many senators failed
     theirs.

   What he doesn't seem to understand is that far too many people really
   don't give a shit about other people. His basic assumption about human
   emotions is flawed:

     And I'm assuming that the emotions that we've all felt since
     Newtown, the emotions that we've all felt since Tucson and Aurora
     and Chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families
     all across the country who've lost a loved one to gun violence --
     I'm assuming that's not a temporary thing.  I'm assuming our
     expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to
     prevent these things from happening are not empty words.

   The fact is that more people react to fear more than he imagines. Too
   many are afraid of losing an election. Too many are afraid of the
   others. Too many are afraid of any number of conspiracy theories...

   Fear is always manifested by irrational behavior and hatred.

   President Obama underestimates the power of fear. It's because he
   assumes that most people are unafraid - like he is unafraid.

   If it weren't for the filibuster we would now have:

   * Federally mandated reciprocity of Concealed Carry.
   * Pistol purchases across state lines
   * A ban on firearm registries
   * Peaceful Traveler laws that permit stopping in state.

   Also increased funding for school security.

   And all we had to give up was:

   * Advertised, online and gun show purchases require background checks.
   Private, non-advertised sales excluded.
   * Purchasing with intent to sell to a known felon becomes a federal
   felony.

   No AWB, No mag ban. Those both failed on the merits, sans filibuster.

   Gun rights activists are the ones that have cause to be upset today. I
   really don't think the rest of you know the first damned thing that

   So I asked him to honest and tell me that, if they repealed all gun

   barely 17%! Until our representation reflects the population, we risk

   He laid it out very clearly..I loved his push back on the critics who
   described family survivors of gun violence who personally visited
   congress as  "props" :

     "Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been
     shattered by gun violence don't have a right to weigh in on this
     issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss, is not relevant to
     this debate?"

   Many legislative changes come as a result from someone's  devasting
   loss . "Megans Law" comes to mind.

   Look, every movement suffers setbacks or frustrations at the pace of
   change. The black civil rights movement is the most obvious, but there
   are others. Women may have gotten the right to vote in 1920, but rising
   to leadership positions in government and business has only slowly
   happened over the last several decades.  Did gays and lesbians during
   the last 15-20 years ever imagine that in 2012 they'd see a majority of
   citizens in 3 states vote to legalize gay marriage? (After about 30
   other such initiatives had gone down to defeat). Did people honestly
   think we'd the citizens of 2 states legalize recreational pot?

   Liberals can't have it both ways. You can't ask Obama to fight harder
   for progressive issues when you know the odds are stacked against him
   and then get all hand-wringy when it doesn't go the right way. If you
   want him to introduce legislation that you know has either no chance or
   an uphill chance of passage, then you should at least be prepared for
   defeat. But if you don't fight at all, you never win. As he said, all
   people can do is keep trying, and someday, the paranoid brigade will be
   overtaken by the sensible gun owners. Once the legislators feel the
   need to listen more to the sensible gun owners, change will come.

   NRA gives money to campaigns that put out expensive T.V. spots that
   manipulate voters.

   Elections are propaganda wars. Money helps the process more than truth
   does.

   We can only win if we give money to truth tellers. But even then we
   won't always win.

 Obama's strategy for the road ahead: ([1255]0+ / 0-)

   Step 1: Ignore the heart of the problem- the filibuster.

   Step 2: Invite NRA to White House, offer concessions (increased clip
   sizes, neutered background check system) in order to get a Grand
   Bargain(TM).

   Step 3: Watch as Grand Bargain(TM) goes down in flames, give speech
   calling for more compromise.

   Step 4: After several months, sign a watered-down and pointless bill
   with a nice-sounding acronym into law.

   Step 5: Repeat.

   Talk to Barbara Boxer and Diane Feinstein and Carl Levin and all who
   drag their feet on fibuster reform. Got nominations? Yes you do. Need
   to fill a few (dozens and dozens) of seats for your branch that need
   Senatorial approval. Oh yes, you do.

   If you are going to rail against people regarding a lack of courage and
   conviction, talk to Reid and his old-school cohorts who are too afraid
   about an inconvenient future they may face in some other election
   cycle. Criticize them for that fear that paralyzes them to where they
   won't do the right thing in the one they are serving in right now. In
   fact I think the surest way to hold on to that house is to fight the
   GOP by taking the Senate back for our side after 6 years of
   obstructionism  with full throated opposition to their ideology.

   Talk to those in your own party. Tell them "Yes we can."
