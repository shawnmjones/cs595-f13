India's Progress

     If you're wondering whether development aid programs really do any
     good, or if you doubt that government spending on things like health
     can really make a difference, then you should go to India, as I did
     again just recently.

   India's progress over the past 20 years has been quite phenomenal. It
   deserves recognition especially now, as rich countries consider whether
   to continue investing in global development assistance despite all the
   economic problems they face at home.

   India still faces many challenges. More than 400 million Indians live
   in extreme poverty. The country is home to half of all the world's
   malnourished and underweight children and one fourth of the world's
   tuberculosis.

   Bill Gates on Progress in India

   But over the past 20 years, India has really emerged as a dynamic,
   influential country. It's been one of the world's fastest growing major
   economies, and it's playing an increasingly important role in world
   affairs, including as a member of the G20 and the BRICS group of newly
   industrialized nations.

   The current situation in India is quite hopeful. The country has a lot
   of talented people. The universities are improving. Government spending
   is going up because of the nation's economic strength. Some reforms are
   needed, and that's progressing, gradually. India represents all the
   challenges you face when you have lots of people living in poverty. And
   so India can contribute to how we solve problems globally.

   A lot of progress has come from the nation's culture of innovation,
   which has produced some really original and creative solutions. Yet,
   aid also has played an important role. Our foundation has invested more
   than $1 billion USD in programs to fight disease and poverty in India.
   I'm pleased with the results, and we will invest more in the future.

   During my recent visit, I had a chance to see the latest progress on
   things that matter a lot to us: on eradicating polio and curtailing the
   spread of infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, for
   example. And I saw how India is emerging as a model and increasingly a
   catalyst for improvement in other developing countries. For example,
   India has become a world leader in the development of high-quality,
   low-cost vaccines and other bio-pharmaceuticals, which are playing a
   huge role in improving health not only in south Asia but also in Africa
   and elsewhere.

   Ending Polio

   It's now been more than a year since the last new case of polio was
   reported in India. In February, India was officially removed from the
   list of polio-endemic countries.

   Bill Gates on Progress in India

   This is especially great when you look at it in context. Three years
   ago, India had more polio cases than anywhere else in the world. Its
   polio problem seemed like the toughest to tackle. Compared with the
   countries where polio persists, India is bigger by far, with the most
   kids, and still has regions where sanitation is poor. Within the
   country there's lots of movement, which tends to spread infection.

   Yet, India really stepped up to the challenge on polio. The government
   funded its own eradication program. They really educated mothers about
   why vaccination is good for kids. Twice a year, 2 million volunteers
   prepare 800,000 vaccination booths around the country--at schools,
   hospitals, and community centers. They immunize more than 172 million
   children one by one. Working with partners like [13]Rotary
   International, [14]WHO, and [15]UNICEF, they have built an impressive
   infrastructure for delivering health services to some of the most
   underprivileged children in the world. And they have been very
   persistent in following up to find kids, even the kids of migrant
   workers, to get vaccination levels up above 90 percent. And so the
   disease stopped.

   Bill Gates on Progress in India

   India is very proud of this achievement, and rightly so. It's a direct
   result of political will, dedicated resources, and rigorous management
   and accountability. The commitment of government leaders has been
   critically important.

   And that commitment is helping with other health problems. By extending
   vaccination into the poorest and most inaccessible places, the drive
   against polio has helped establish better public-health delivery
   systems that can improve the well-being of millions of children and
   families.

   India's experience carries lessons for developing and newly
   industrialized countries around the world. It proves that success can
   be achieved - against polio and other diseases, as well - even in the
   most challenging circumstances.


   Curbing HIV/AIDS & Tuberculosis

   Another great example of India's progress is in its work to halt the
   spread of HIV/AIDS. Our foundation has been helping with this for a
   long time. With a number of Indian partners, we started the Avahan
   program. It's fighting HIV/AIDS in communities and at the street level,
   helping local groups deploy peer-to-peer counselors, distribute condoms
   and provide HIV testing, treatment and care.

   Important leadership has been provided by the national government,
   which has increased funding for HIV/AIDS and established a national
   strategic plan that includes community-led HIV prevention. The National
   AIDS Control Organization has done great work. NACO and Avahan have
   contributed to a 50-percent reduction in the incidence of HIV/AIDS over
   the past six years. That's saved India something like $100 million USD
   in health costs averted because of fewer AIDS cases.

   Bill Gates on Progress in India

   Now, NACO is facilitating a smooth transition of Avahan to management
   by the state governments. This transition is very important and
   encouraging because it indicates India's resolve to sustain the fight
   against HIV/AIDS for the long haul, which is what it will take to
   really beat this thing. This is a great example of what collaboration
   between funders and governments can achieve.

   Lessons learned from HIV/AIDS work have helped with other critical
   health efforts, like the Ananya partnership, which is really scaling up
   programs to improve maternal and child health. India is also a model
   for other countries on how to scale up HIV prevention efforts.

   The country faces many other health challenges. For example, India has
   the largest tuberculosis epidemic in the world, with nearly one
   thousand deaths from TB each day. But there's a solid basic TB control
   program and a real commitment to getting TB under control. The
   government has an ambitious strategic plan to provide universal access
   to good diagnosis and treatment to all TB patients. This plan can
   prevent the emergence of multidrug resistant TB thru prompt diagnosis
   and appropriate treatment.

   India has begun to execute this strategy by making TB a nationally
   notifiable disease, which means cases must be reported to authorities.
   This will help ensure they get the care they need regardless of whether
   they are being treated by government or private doctors.

   India is also using its leadership in information technology, which
   could be a big help to government and private health providers in
   monitoring the spread of the disease, improving the efficiency of the
   TB control program and in treating patients.


   Leading on Low-cost Vaccines

   Just a few decades ago in India, many basic vaccines were hard to get.
   They were almost all imported from overseas. But today, Indian
   manufacturers play a critical role in driving down prices for vaccines
   and making them available to not only Indians but also millions of poor
   people worldwide.

   One of the leaders in this transformation is the Serum Institute, in
   Pune. I visited with Serum's chairman Cyrus Poonawalla and other
   executives. Their work is absolutely vital to our foundation's work
   around the world, because Serum is extremely good at making
   high-quality vaccines for many different diseases - and doing it at low
   cost so that poor countries can afford them.

   Bill Gates on Progress in India

   Serum has gradually evolved from making relatively simple vaccines for
   things like tetanus to making more advanced ones. In response to a
   request from African leaders for a better weapon against meningitis
   epidemics, Serum developed a vaccine for meningitis A, the first
   vaccine created specifically for poor countries. Serum is developing
   important new vaccines against rotavirus, which causes diarrhea and
   vomiting that kills hundreds of thousands of children in poor countries
   every year.

   Serum's the world's highest-volume provider of vaccines - does it at
   very high quality, very low price. It's a great example of the
   potential for innovation in developing and newly industrializing
   countries - innovation that can benefit poor people everywhere.


   Achieving Progress through Collaboration

   Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently committed to raising government
   investments in health to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2017, which will really
   help extend health services to more people and will pay big economic
   dividends in the long term.

   Bill Gates on Progress in India

   During my recent India trip, I was very glad to see the evolution and
   strengthening of our partnerships with government.  I spoke with many
   government leaders including the dynamic chief ministers of two states,
   Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which are among the poorest in the country. I
   was very impressed with the forward strides they're making. The chief
   minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, is under 40, the state's
   youngest chief minister ever.

   In Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar has helped drive remarkable
   improvements in farm productivity and is taking steps toward big
   improvements in health. Bihar's maternal mortality rate is among the
   highest in India. But good things are happening. Last year our
   foundation launched a five-year, $80-million USD grant made in
   partnership with the state government and leading Indian and
   international non-government organizations. Bihar is becoming one of
   the nation's biggest success stories.

   As in Bihar, one important reason we invest in India is that we've
   found the government can be a very effective partner. Our government
   partners there are especially good at scaling up the very best ideas
   and sustaining them over the long term, as they've done with polio and
   now with HIV/AIDS.

   This pattern has been repeated across the country over the past several
   decades. And as a result, aid has steadily become a smaller and smaller
   portion of the national economy. This is the good that can happen when
   aid donors and governments work hand in hand.
