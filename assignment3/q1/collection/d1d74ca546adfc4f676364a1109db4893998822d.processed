   Dekalb Elementary School
   The good news is there are no [30]reported injuries:

     Channel 2 Action News has confirmed that one person is in custody
     after shots were fired at a DeKalb County elementary school.

     The DeKalb County schoolboard chairman said a there was an active
     shooter at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy.

     Chairman Melvin Johnson said there have been reports of shots fired.
     There are no injuries.

   Apparently, the gunman demanded school officials alert the media:

     A woman in the school office called Channel 2 Action News to report
     that there was a shooter in the school. She told a Channel 2
     assignment desk editor that the gunman asked her to call WSB-TV.
     Shots could be heard over the call.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [45]Tagging tips - [46]Search For Tags - [47]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health
   Care, [58]International, [59]Labor, [60]Law, [61]Media, [62]Meta,
   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   I'd like to start a new meme: "No means no" is a misnomer. It should be
   "Only 'Yes' means yes." Just because someone doesn't say "No" doesn't
   mean they've given consent. If she didn't say "Yes", there is no

       in America, they would have been shipped to another school, or to
