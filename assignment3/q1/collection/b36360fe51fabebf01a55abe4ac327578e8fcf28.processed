   APR
   [29]The New York Times hails the Supreme Court's decision to refuse
   patent protection for human DNA:

     In a unanimous ruling on Thursday, the Supreme Court correctly
     resolved one of the most important and complex disputes in a
     generation involving the intersection of science, law and commerce.
     The justices held that human DNA isolated from a chromosome cannot
     be patented because it is a product of nature. [...]

     Among the petitioners was Dr. Harry Ostrer, a researcher who had
     sent DNA samples to a lab at the University of Pennsylvania for
     testing. Myriad asserted that the lab's testing infringed the
     company's patents and got the lab to stop, since the patents gave
     the company the exclusive right to isolate someone's BRCA1 and BRCA2
     genes. Dr. Oster said after the court's ruling that the price of the
     tests would come down and that the decision would have "an immediate
     impact on people's health."

   Here's [30]The Washington Post's take:

     It is the right call but can't be the last word. Congress must
     explore how to encourage useful genetic research while allowing the
     fruits of that inquiry to be used as freely as possible. [...]
     Since patent claims have been made on something like 4,000 of the
     23,000 human genes, it could have been extremely costly to sort
     through a patient's genetic code to determine the particular medical
     risks that person faces. Following the ruling, doctors and
     researchers won't face a thicket of gene patents, and patients will
     now be able to get second opinions from different genetic-analysis
     firms instead of having to rely solely on testing results from
     patent-holders. [...]

     Awarding patents is one way government can encourage such effort,
     but it is not the only way. Congress should examine whether
     government-funded research and persisting market opportunities are
     enough to motivate genetic research, or whether it should offer more
     narrowly drawn patents, prize money or other new incentives for
     companies to continue sorting through the genome.

   For more on the day's top stories, head below the fold.

   [31]Marc Lynch at Foreign Policy takes a closer look at the issue of
   Syria, now that it's been confirmed that chemical weapons have used:

     The pressure on the administration to deepen its military
     involvement in the Syrian conflict may become irresistible, as my
     Foreign Policy colleague Aaron David Miller argued this week -- even
     as the public overwhelmingly opposes such steps and nobody really
     believes that the ideas on offer will work.

     Washington's Syria debate rages within the boundaries of a broader
     debate about America's appropriate role in the Middle East and the
     world. The Obama administration clearly and correctly places a high
     premium on not being dragged into another Iraq-style quagmire. Many
     in Washington view this refusal to intervene in Syria, like the
     withdrawal from Iraq, as an abdication of leadership. But even most
     hawks recognize that the United States can't afford, and the public
     doesn't want, another Iraq or Afghanistan -- that's why few openly
     recommend a full-scale U.S. intervention.

     The endless arguments about Syria too often focus on the tactics --
     arming the rebels, diplomacy, no-fly zones. But as Micah Zenko
     recently noted in FP, these more limited options involve Washington
     more directly in the war without any realistic prospect of ending
     it. Cratering runways might work for a few hours, but then Bashar
     al-Assad will repair them. No-fly zones might limit the destruction
     of Assad's air force, but the Syrian military has other resources at
     its disposal. Arming the rebels will slightly tilt the battlefield
     but will not likely break the strategic stalemate or give Washington
     significant influence within the Syrian opposition. The first step
     on the slippery slope is always easy, but it's much harder to
     actually resolve a conflict or to find a way out of a quagmire.

   On the six month anniversary of Newtown, [32]Robyn Thomas and Juliet
   Leftwich survey the gun control landscape at The Los Angeles Times:

     Since December, six states have strengthened firearms laws.
     Connecticut, Maryland and New York passed packages that include laws
     to expand and improve background checks, limit the sale or transfer
     of military-style assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition
     magazines, require safety training and improve systems for keeping
     guns away from domestic violence abusers and the dangerously
     mentally ill. Delaware and Colorado passed laws requiring background
     checks on all gun sales, the very requirement that our federal
     government failed to enact. California added enforcement teeth to
     its law to confiscate guns from criminals and the mentally ill.

     And in New Jersey and again in California, we're tracking pending
     legislation that would tighten regulation of assault weapons and
     large-capacity ammunition magazines, regulate ammunition transfer
     and keep guns out of the hands of individuals who should not have
     them, among other common-sense regulations.

     There have been setbacks: In Nevada this week a background-check
     bill was vetoed by the governor. But failure this year doesn't mean
     the fight is over. In at least four other states where such
     legislation was introduced but didn't become law, advocates are
     gearing up for another try next year. In all, we've seen a
     year-to-year increase of 231% in the introduction of common sense
     gun-safety legislation nationwide.

   Pediatrician [33]Kate Tulenko, board member of the National Physicians
   Alliance, adds her take:

     Action at the state level is not enough. Sensible federal
     legislation is necessary. Polling for the group Mayors Against
     Illegal Guns found that "82 percent of gun owners -- including 74
     percent of National Rifle Association members -- support requiring
     criminal background checks for anyone purchasing a gun." Washington
     Post-ABC News polling in December found that 54 percent of Americans
     favor stricter gun laws, with 59 percent supporting a ban on
     high-capacity magazines.

     Thirty-three people in this country are killed by guns every day,
     Mayors Against Illegal Guns noted in February. Our society must make
     changes. As we remember the victims of the Newtown shootings, let us
     take action to prevent such an atrocity from ever happening again.

   [34]The Hartford Courant:

     unlike past efforts to strengthen gun safety laws, this one has not
     gone away. Newtown families are in Washington again this week
     pushing for sensible gun safety measures. New York Mayor Michael
     Bloomberg and other mayors are bringing the heat on senators who
     voted against the background check bill.

     Perhaps more important, there is a national discussion about gun
     safety. Many people now know that guns take the lives of more than
     31,000 people a year, almost as many as die in car accidents.

     The carnage continues. Last week a gunman killed five people in
     Santa Monica, Calif., before being killed by police. Four people
     were killed yesterday in St. Louis. In Prescott Valley, Ariz., last
     week, a 4-year-old boy found a loaded gun in the home of a family
     friend and accidentally killed his father with it.

     What is it going to take?

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health

   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   but even in the last days of WWII, Germans did not resort to poison

   notoriously difficult to control or predict and may, with a simple

       But the French and English followed so quickly in deploying theirs
       that it was obvious they had their weapons ready to go at the drop
       of a hat. Both sides were basically seeing who'd "go there" first.
       Anyway, I believe it was 1915, phosgene gas and was used against
       the French.
       Here's an excellent account of the attack, written by a British
       serviceman in the Ypres sector, a few miles from where the British
       lines met the French.

     It was Thursday evening, April 22nd, 1915.  In a meadow off the
     Poperinghe-Ypres road, the men of the Queen Victoria Rifles were
     taking their ease.  We had just fought our first big action in the

 Humanitarian aid to Syrian rebels, Jordan ([220]6+ / 0-)

   and Turkey to help shoulder the expenses involved in providing
   emergency medicine and housing and feeding refugees - and tracked so
   the funds are not used for anything else, including weapons purchases
   and particularly Turkey's current crackdown on its own people.  That's
   it.  Those are the only contributions we should be making involving
   Syria's civil war.

   Juan Cole was warning this country months ago that the rebels in Syria
   consisted of many different factions, including al Qaida - in fact al
   Qaida was the strongest of the factions and had amassed the most
   fighters on the ground in Syria.  Because of their strength, al Qaida
   was absorbing many of the weaker factions, especially most of the
   factions favoring institution of Islamic law.

   The war in Syria boils down to a religious civil war between Shi'ites

   the hawks in congress never mention that fact.  The idea that we could

       U.S. Patent 6630507

     The U.S. Patent Office issued patent #6630507 to the U.S.Health and
     Human Services filed on 2/2/2001. The patent lists the use of
     certain cannabinoids found within the cannabis sativa plant as
     useful in certain neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's,
     Parkinson's, and HIV dementia.

     Since cannabis sativa (marijuana) contains compounds recognized and
     endorsed by an agency of the U.S. government why is it that
     marijuana remains on the Federal Schedule One list of drugs? The
     issuance of patent #6630507 is a direct contradiction of the
     governments own definition for classification of a Schedule 1 drug.

     US Patent 6,630,507  Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and
     Neuroprotectants

     "Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties,
     unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property makes
     cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety
     of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related,
     inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to
     have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in
     limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as
     stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative
     diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV
     dementia. Nonpsychoactive cannabinoids, such as cannabidoil, are
     particularly advantageous to use because they avoid toxicity that is
     encountered with psychoactive cannabinoids at high doses useful in
     the method of the present invention."...

       Specific applications of such material, perhaps, could be patented

   Patents have not encouraged innovation, period.

   In fact, they have often choked it to death with stupidity and greed.

   For once, the SCOTUS was dead-right.  There is no need to encourage
   useless, non-innovation-spurring mechanisms like patent (which in the
   IT world has merely turned huge chunks of the market into a giant
   sticky troll football).  I have a feeling most of the required and

       and Policy Research, Beat the Press, Dean Baker takes on patent
       monopolies and their negative economic effects at least once a
       month.  Though he primarily writes on medical patents, the economic
       effects are endemic to monopoly patents in every industry.

     Patent monopolies lead to enormous market distortions in the same
     way as other barriers to trade. However, the impact of patents is
     much larger since they have a much bigger effect on prices. It is
     rare that tariffs raise the price of goods by more than 20-30
     percent. By contrast, patents often raise the price of protected
     drugs by several thousand percent.

     The huge profits created by patent rents are the cause of kickbacks
     to doctors, misleading information on the safety and effectiveness
     of drugs, and government corruption that extends the length and
     scope of patent rents. These distortions lower the quality of health
     care and raise its cost. There are far more efficient mechanisms for
     supporting medical research.

 The interesting issue ([407]0+ / 0-)
       Most IT patents are for things like (a) "business process patents"
       (something that common sense says is not at all patentable), (b)
       user interface design (how the hell do you get off on patenting the
       shape of a smartphone?  how about patenting the various finger
       motions on touch screens?).  Virtually everything in UI design has
       been around for more than 30 years.  A lot of smartphone UI design
       was rejected for desktop computers decades ago; it came back
       because it's the only real option for dealing with a 3" by 5" user
       interface.  And (c) patenting programming and design stuff that has
       long been in use.
       And this isn't a side effect.  Most patents are cooked up by patent
       factories and sold to large companies looking to defend themselves
       or (if it's someone like Apple) troll a competitor.  (The
       aboveboard way is to set up a legitimate startup, come up with some
       patents, and use that to make the startup a good acquisition
       target.)  And most large corporations, rather than pay the pirates,
       set up their own patent factories.
       There are a small handful of valid things to patent in software
       (the RSA PKI patent, run-length encoding, and probably the
       colorspace mapping in GIF) but most software patents are nonsense,
       and business process patents are complete garbage.  On the other
       hand, pre-millenium act copyright law did an excellent job of
       legally protecting software (not just the code itself, but most
       ways of covering up copying -- most of the rules could be taken
       from music copyrights).
       IP law in general is less about protecting innovation and
       legitimate trade secrets and more about creating assets that can be
       traded back and forth.

   where assertions were made that Saddam indeed had WMDs and had even
