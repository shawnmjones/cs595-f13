Man indicted on homicide charge after DUI video confession

   By Marlei Martinez and David Simpson, CNN
   updated 11:41 AM EDT, Mon September 9, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: An Ohio grand jury has indicted Matthew Cordle
     * In an online video, he confessed that his drunken driving killed a
       man in June
     * Prosecutor: There will be no leniency based on the video
     * Defense: Cordle wanted to raise drunken driving awareness, give
       closure to victim's family

   (CNN) -- A driver who confessed in an online video that his drunken
   driving killed a man now faces a homicide charge.

   A grand jury in Franklin County, Ohio, indicted Matthew Cordle on
   Monday on charges of aggravated vehicular homicide and operating a
   vehicle under the influence of alcohol, more than two months after the
   deadly wrong-way collision.

   The 22-year-old's online admission that he was to blame has been
   watched more than a million times on YouTube.

   Now, Ohio's legal system must decide what punishment fits his crime. He
   is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon.

   If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of eight and a half years in
   prison, prosecutor Ron O'Brien said.

   Polarizing video

   "My name is Matthew Cordle, and on June 22nd, 2013, I hit and killed
   Vincent Canzani," he says in the video posted last week.

   In the video, he recounts how he was out with friends, drank heavily
   and lost control the night of June 22.

   Canzani, 61, died when a wrong-way driver hit his Jeep on Interstate
   670 near Columbus, Ohio.

   The [41]video was posted on a website called "because I said I would,"
   which provides a forum for people to make promises to others.

   Some viewers were impressed by Cordle's apparent courage and his plea,
   "I'm begging you, please don't drink and drive."

   But some viewers thought the video was "a crock," in the words of one
   commenter on the video site, aimed at reducing Cordle's probable prison
   sentence.

   Remorse called genuine

   Canzani's ex-wife, Cheryl Oates, says she believes Cordle's remorse is
   genuine.

   "He said I made a huge mistake, and I'm going to take what's coming to
   me," Oates said. "You've got to respect him for that."

   Oates said Cordle should spend time in prison. But as a mother of two
   sons, she also feels pain for Cordle when she watches the video.

   "It's gut-wrenching coming from a mother looking at that young boy, and
   he just doesn't understand the damage that he did," she said.

   Lawyer: Leniency isn't goal

   Cordle has pledged to plead guilty and said on his video, "I'm handing
   the prosecution everything they need to put me away for a very long
   time."

   O'Brien said the video has not influenced him to recommend a lighter
   sentence.

   "We had a case against him based on the evidence as I know it before
   the video was filmed," he said.

   Cordle's lawyer, George S. Breitmayer III, said leniency was not the
   goal of Cordle's video.

   "Despite any speculation of his intentions, the video was meant to
   raise awareness related to the serious issues surrounding drinking and
   driving," the defense lawyer said in a statement sent to CNN. "In
   addition, (Cordle) hopes his confession will offer the Canzanis some
   level of closure by avoiding any lengthy, drawn out legal proceedings."
