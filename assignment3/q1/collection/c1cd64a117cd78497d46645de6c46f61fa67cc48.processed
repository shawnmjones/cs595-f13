   Study Finds Way to Track Malaria Parasite Evolution

   An international research team announced last week that it has found a
   way to identify hotspots of malaria parasite evolution and track the
   rise of resistance to malaria drugs in a new and more efficient way. As
   resistance grows to play a larger role in malaria prevalence, this
   research could have widespread implications.

   The technique involves analyzing the genetic maps of malaria parasites
   straight from patientsâ blood samples through the extraction of the
   parasiteâs DNA directly from the blood, removing as much human DNA from
   the sample as possible.

   Monitoring the genetic pool of malaria parasites is important: âIf we
   want to control resistance, we first need to be able to monitor the
   genetic diversity of P. falciparum and identify hotspots of potential
   resistance as they occur, says Dominic Kwiatkowski, of Britainâs
   Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Oxford University, who led the
   research team.

   The technique developed by Kwiatkowski and his associates will make the
   process of tracking drug-resistance parasites more efficient; there is
   no need to grow the parasite in a blood culture in a lab before
   determining its genetic code.

   Kwiatkowski emphasized, âRapid sequencing of parasite genomes from the
   blood of infected people is a powerful way of detecting new changes in
   the parasite population and potentially an important new surveillance
   tool [for controlling malaria].â

   Other findings include that one infected person can harbor several
   genetically different malaria parasites, which allows for recombination
   of parasite DNA to create new forms. Researchers asserted that this
   illustrates how the pace of parasite evolution is impacted by human
   factors as well as geography.

   In their study, researchers analyzed parasite samples from Burkino
   Faso, Cambodia, Kenya, Mali, Papua New Guinea and Thailand.

   Kwiatowskiâs fellow researcher Nick White of Oxford University and
   Mahidol University in Thailand was optimistic that this research could
   have a global impact: âWe can now build on this technique to identify
   hotspots of anti-malarial drug resistance around the world and contain
   them effectively.â
