[22]Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: Shockingly, a Republican wins in South
Carolina

   [29]National Journal:

     Memo to Anthony Weiner: Stand down.

     Sure, Republican Mark Sanford's election to Congress on Tuesday
     despite an ignominious affair suggests a certain tolerance among
     voters for sex scandal, possibly raising the hopes of the potential
     New York City mayoral candidate who resigned from Congress after
     dispatching a lewd photo online.

     But before Weiner and other disgraced politicians start seeking
     electoral redemption, they should consider that in South Carolina's
     heavily conservative First Congressional District, just about anyone
     -- including an ethically challenged adulterer who misled the state
     about his whereabouts while governor -- is preferable to a
     union-backing Nancy Pelosi clone.

   [30][4bb978600b0425f725f15b0bf10a3b47_normal.jpeg] Kudos to the voters
   of South Carolina for recognizing that 99% of what you need to know
   about a House candidate is party affiliation.

   [33]Helen Branswell:

     The numbers of new cases of H7N9 bird flu are still rising, but
     these days the daily increase is more a trickle than the gush of a
     few weeks ago.

     That apparent slowing of what had been an explosive growth of
     infections with the new flu may lead people to hope this virus is
     being brought under control. Some minds may see a week or two of
     fewer new cases as a crisis averted.

     But experts warn it's far too soon to gauge what H7N9 has in store
     for humankind. And while the virus initially seemed as if it might
     be another 2009 H1N1 -- new virus, lightning-fast global spread --
     at this point H7N9 does not appear to be in a sprint to the pandemic
     declaration line.

     It's a bad virus, one that makes people severely ill. And it
     perplexes authorities trying to find it because it doesn't sicken
     chickens. That latter fact means China is having a hard time getting
     a handle on where and how widely dispersed the virus is. Without
     that knowledge, eradicating it or even bringing it under control is
     not a likely scenario.

   And check out this comment:

     "It does become challenging because if we have to continue to track
     the virus and try to understand if it might be changing over a long
     period of time, some people lose interest," says Nancy Cox, who
     heads the influenza division at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
     in Atlanta.

     "We won't lose interest, but some people lose interest."

   Not me. I'm always interested, partly because I think it's important to
   plan for pandemics.

   For example:
   [34][20423349f3c54e6b6759eac28ca3219a_normal.jpeg] As of 5/3, 45 U.S.
   states had received CDC-developed test kits to detect #H7N9.
   [35]http://t.co/...
   -- [36]@CDCFlu via web
   That's what your public health department does.

   More politics and policy below the fold.

   [37]Greg Sargent:

     There's no question that the defeat of Manchin-Toomey was a crushing
     one. But it needs to be restated that the gun control forces
     actually moved the ball significantly this year. There is now a bill
     -- negotiated by "pro gun" Senators in both parties -- that can be
     activated at a moment's notice, one that has already won the support
     of a majority of the Senate. That is not nothing. And indeed, talks
     are currently underway among senators over how to tweak the
     legislation to win over holdouts that are still thought to be
     gettable.

     All of that said, some caution is in order. If there is going to be
     any chance at eventual victory, it may well require a very long
     struggle, which will require gun reformers to show that they can
     sustain organization and energy for a protracted period. We're
     seeing signs -- in the form of groups launched by Mike Bloomberg and
     Gabrielle Giffords -- that the gun reform side is genuinely in the
     process of building an infrastructure to match the NRA. But we don't
     know what kind of staying power it will have or whether it will be
     able to exert pressure that actually matters to red state Dems (or
     for that matter bluish state Republicans such as Kelly Ayotte, who
     may be immune to pressure, because she is not playing to type as a
     New England moderate).

   She may be immune, but the pressure will make her a one term senator.

   [38]Pacific Standard:

     How Social Groups Influence Parents' Decision to Vaccinate

     It's not just the family physician offering advice on whether to
     vaccinate or not. Parents are also turning to friends, family,
     books, pamphlets, and the Internet for guidance.

   [39]Michael Todd:

     Politicians from former presidential contenders to D.C. legislators
     to local sheriffs all insist that the border needs to be fixed
     before we can talk about legalizing existing illegal immigrants or
     making other changes to immigration policy. This week, Senator Marco
     Rubio, a member of the "gang of eight" working on drafting an
     immigration bill, repeated the mantra that there will be no bill
     without better border security. In Mexico today, President Obama
     reportedly will be stressing the need to secure the border (which to
     Mexicans might involve preventing U.S. guns from heading south). NPR
     quoted Obama security adviser Ben Rhodes: "With Mexico, first and
     foremost, they are critical to our ability to secure the border. All
     the immigration plans that have been contemplated put a focus on
     securing the border as an essential priority and starting point for
     immigration reform."

     But if that is a precondition, then bring on reform--that plumbing
     has been solidly repaired for some time.

   WaPo describes the current landscape in Washington:

     After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, the red ink is
     receding rapidly in Washington, easing pressure on policymakers but
     shattering hopes for a summertime budget deal.

     Federal tax revenue is up and spending is down thanks to an
     improving economy, tax increases enacted in January and the
     automatic budget cuts known as the sequester....

     In the meantime, Republicans face a listless summer, with little
     appetite for compromise but no leverage to shape an agreement.
     Without that leverage, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan
     (R-Wis.) said Tuesday, there is no point in opening formal budget
     negotiations between the House and the Senate, because Democrats
     have no reason to consider the kind of far-reaching changes to
     Medicare and the U.S. tax code that Republicans see as fundamental
     building blocks of a deal.

   Good. So what? And other adjectives that convey a sense that the author
   doesn't realize it doesn't matter that republicans can't get their way.
   In fact, way more often than not, it's a wonderful thing when that
   happens.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health

   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Dr. Andrew Wakefield ([134]0+ / 0-)

     The most pernicious, persistent myth out there is that vaccines
     cause autism, despite the fact that the British study (and its
     author) who first perpetrated the myth have been discredited.

   Dr Wakefield hypothesized in his case study in the Lancet that the MMR
   (measles mumps rubella) vaccine was causing a form of gastrointestinal
   disorder in which autism would also occur. Gastrointestinal disorders
   were his speciality and he collected these cases as a "case study"
   which is very typical in research. It was not a statistical analysis
   nor was it ever promoted as one. First you come up with a theory, then
   you produce a statistical experiment to deduce if your theory can be
   proven. The Lancet article was nothing more than that.

   Dr Wakefield's theory was that three different viruses entering the
   body at the same time could create this condition, especially since
   measles affects the immune system. His recommendation was to give three
   different vaccinations separated by a year rather than a single MMR
   shot.

   Dr Wakefield never made the statement that a specific vaccine causes
   autism. His issue was with the MMR combination vaccine, not vaccines in
   general.

       And SC tells Jenny Sanford to just get over it because SC is making

       And, by the way, as long as folks like Sanford find love abroad,

       the way the world is going, the politics that the GOP proffer will
       soon impact those things that make it a beautiful state: public
       parks gone, education completely destroyed, no working
       infrastructure and Hoovervilles everywhere.
       Even if people stay out of politics, with the kind of politics the

       is it just domestic poultry? remains to be seen. But that can be
       culled, and doing so will slow this virus down.
       The trouble is that as a low pathogenic virus, birds get infected
       bout not sick. So you have to be vigilant and test and not just
       close the live market or cull the flock when you see dead birds.

       Yes. People will make money off of this. Welcome to humanity.
       But that's a side show. The disease is real, and if you actually
       read the article,it hasn't reached the point where you can call it
       "fizzled out".  H5N1 hasn't either, just keeps smoldering along.
       H7N9 will likely do the same, and it continues to concern (not
       "alarm", concern) public health people.
       Preparations to deal with it is money well spent.

       quick and easy detection kits - for example, a small strip of paper
       that a person could cough on and it would turn a certain color if
       infected by influenza (not sure if it could discriminate between
       different strains in any event).
       Another nuance is the fixation on single viruses (which I
       understand can be important in some contexts, like the current one)
       and the cumulative impact of the thousands of different types found
       in people.
       [225]for example from this Science article (Going Viral: Exploring
       the Role Of Viruses in Our Bodies):

     For years, virologists have documented specific viral infections,
     including HIV and SARS, by detecting identifiable viral DNA within
     blood or other tissues. But to do a comprehensive survey of the
     viruses in the body--the so-called virome--"is a true frontier,"
     says B. Brett Finlay, a microbiologist at UBC Vancouver. Last July,
     Jeffrey Gordon, a microbiologist at Washington University (WU)
     School of Medicine in St. Louis, and his colleagues described one
     such effort in a group of seemingly healthy people. They isolated
     and characterized the viromes of adult identical twins and their
     mothers, sampling stools for viral genetic material three times over
     the course of a year. The overall conclusion: Healthy people "are
     full of viruses," says WU's George Weinstock.

     By one measure, the number of distinct viruses in the stool samples
     ranged from 52 to 2773. The viromes varied significantly from one
     individual to the next
     Wylie, Weinstock, WU's Gregory Storch, and their colleagues
     sequenced the DNA obtained from nasal swabs or blood plasma of 151
     individuals, about half of whom had unexplained fevers. The team
     estimated there were 10,000 viral sequences in the plasma samples of
     the children with fever and only about 1000 in healthy children.
     Some of the viruses found were common human pathogens, such as
     herpes and cold viruses. But there also seem to be unusual viruses,
     including an astrovirus, in the mix, Wylie reported. "There were new
     isolates that you might not have thought would be associated with
     febrile illness," says Frederic Bushman, a virologist at the
     University of Pennsylvania.
       IOW, who knows what viruses are making us (or maybe more precisely,
       our kids) sick!

   The good news is that there does not seem to be any evidence it is

     experts say they see no evidence so far of the most worrisome

 Well, presumably you can't do the PCR ([286]0+ / 0-)
       test right out there in the field - at least some rudimentary lab
       is required - so, you have to catch the bird, get a (blood?)

       What do you do with the bird in the mean time?  Kill it in case it
       was infected?  Let it go in case it wasn't??

   Pre-disgraced Politicians is the next wave in maintaining the status
   quo.

   Why wait to find out the promises made by a politician hold less water
   than a coffee filter, when you can vote for a complete loser with
   CONFIDENCE.

   Since we don't - honestly - expect anything from politicans other than
   disrespect, lying, cheating, stealing, cronyism, kabuki, catfood, and
   anything but the right decison, I think we should not write of known
   shitty politicians.

   Since not doing things correctly is the Serious Adult Responsible
   value, why bother with listening to claims of do-gooder-ness and just
   focus on electing those who will ignore your requests the quickest.

   a"brand new" bill has to be drafted, which President Obama then has to

   than making political hay out of going against Obama.

   study showing significant reduction in gun violence over 20 years.

   Gun nuts, doubtlessly see this as a reason to not do any more control,
   but the anti-gun nut crowd also seems to be having a sad freak-out.

 Fix the border before fixing policy? Impossible. ([480]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [481]tb mare, [482]Stude Dude, [483]BlueEyed In NC

   It's the policy that makes the border porous.

   Migration is driven by "push" and "pull" factors: the things that drive
   people away from their homes, and the things that draw them to other
   places.

   There is absolutely nothing we can do about the push factors
   (unemployment, violence, corruption) that drive people out of countries
   like Mexico. Nothing. It's not within our purview.

   All we can influence are the pull factors that bring people here, and
   the No. 1 pull factor is jobs: specifically, under-the-table jobs that
   allow employers to skirt wage-and-hour laws, workplace safety
   regulations and other labor protections. As long as those exist,
   immigrants will cross that border as surely as water will eventually
   find its way through concrete.

   We need to stop talking about illegal immigration and turn the topic of
   conversation to illegal hiring.

   Also, as long as we reward people who immigrate illegally with jobs
   while punishing those who try to immigrate legally with astronomical
   fees, endless red tape and humiliation, it's not difficult to grasp
   that we're going to get more of the former and less of the latter.

   "The great lie of democracy, its essential paradox, is that democracy
   is the first to be sacrificed when its security is at risk. Every state
   is totalitarian at heart; there are no ends to the cruelty it will go
   to to protect itself." -- Ian McDonald
