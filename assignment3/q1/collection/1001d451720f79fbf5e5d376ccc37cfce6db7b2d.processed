   Saxby Chambliss won in 2002 by comparing Vietnam war hero Max Cleland
   to Osama bin Laden
   U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), the chickenhawk Republican
   political hack who won his Senate seat by comparing triple amputee
   Vietnam veteran Max Cleland to Osama bin Laden, [31]is retiring.

     U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss will announce this morning that he's
     dropping plans to run for a third term in 2014, a decision certain
     to set off an avalanche of Republican candidates who will seek to
     replace him.

     Word out of Washington is that Chambliss broke the news to his
     senior staff this morning.

   You'd think that the offensive nature of his path to power would have
   permanently ingratiated himself with the Republican base, but Chambliss
   was actually facing the prospect of a serious primary challenge from
   incumbent Rep. Paul Broun or Rep. Tom Price, both Republican members of
   the house. Apparently, Chambliss decided that he'd rather quit than
   defend himself against someone running on the "I'm wingnuttier than
   you" platform.

   But now that Chambliss is out, it may be Broun and Price who need to
   look over their shoulders--for this guy:
   Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain speaks about taxes at the
   American Enterprise Institute in Washington, October 31, 2011.
   REUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS ELECTIONS
   BUSINESS)
   It turns out that retired pizza executive Herman Cain is still a giant
   in the wingnutosophere--and Georgia Republicans would love to have him
   represent their party:
   [32][Picture1_normal.gif] With news of Saxby Chambliss' retirement, we
   found last month the top choice of GA Republicans would be Herman Cain:
   [33]http://t.co/...
   -- [34]@ppppolls via web
   And that was when Chambliss was still running. Cain registered 36
   percent support -- 13 points ahead of Chambliss. Broun and Price
   combined got 7 percent, less than Allen West who doesn't even live in
   the state. So if Cain were to decide to run, he'd become the instant
   favorite for the GOP nomination. And if that happens ... grab your
   popcorn.

   [35]7:27 AM PT: Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee executive
   director Guy Cecil:

     Georgia will now offer Democrats one of our best pick-up
     opportunities of the cycle. There are already several reports of the
     potential for a divisive primary that will push Republicans to the
     extreme right. Regardless, there's no question that the demographics
     of the state have changed and Democrats are gaining strength. This
     will be a top priority.

   [36]7:34 AM PT: How could I possibly have [37]forgotten to extol the
   virtues of a [38]Karen Handel candidacy? Handel is the former Georgia
   Secretary of State who was the architect of the Susan G. Komen
   Foundation's debacle with Planned Parenthood. And last year, she was
   rumored as a Chambliss challenger. So, Herman, Handle, Broun, and
   Price--what a glorious primary that would be.

   [39]8:22 AM PT: Say it ain't so!
   [40][0t56mtxc58fljrrs4d2c_normal.jpeg] Per NBC's Bob Costantini, Herman
   Cain ruled out running for Chambliss's Senate seat on his radio show
   today.
   -- [41]@mpoindc via [42]Seesmic twhirl
   Fortunately, the crazy runs deep in that primary field.

   [43]8:28 AM PT: LOL:
   [44][image_normal.jpg] Please understand that those of you publicly
   asking me to reconsider are going on a list of people my wife will hate
   always.  Not happening.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [62]Tagging tips - [63]Search For Tags - [64]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [65]Civil
   Rights, [66]Community, [67]Congress, [68]Culture, [69]Economy,
   [70]Education, [71]Elections, [72]Energy, [73]Environment, [74]Health
   Care, [75]International, [76]Labor, [77]Law, [78]Media, [79]Meta,
   [80]National Security, [81]Science, [82]Transportation, or [83]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([84]California, [85]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       one woman we're not interesting in having in the Senate to help

       1. GOP runs a slate of teahadists in a primary, where each one
       seeks to be more Bachmann-esque than the clown to their right.
       2. We get a strong candidate on our side of the ticket.
       It would seem that #1 is very likely. #2 may be the tougher part.

   What about the mayor of Atlanta (Kasim Reed)? One of the facts of
   recent elections in this country is that Democrats do not do very well
   as far as turnout by their base during "off-year" (i.e.
   non-presidential) elections. It seems to me that the mayor of THE major
   city in the state running for an open seat like this could help to
   overcome that traditional lack of turnout in urban areas and among
   minority voters.

   Or would that only stimulate more turnout among the anti-urban, racist

   But he will probably wait to judge the strength of the Republican

   He seems an ambitious guy, and a weak Republican field may be the best
   chance at a statewide seat for the next long while.  It's not easy to
   jump from mayor, otherwise.

   He's also built a solid resume to appeal to centrists - pushed for
   TSPLOST, but also for Savannah harbor deepening, for example.  True, he
   won't win the vote of bigots, but Dems aren't getting their votes,

       don't recall any details.  The article criticized some of her
       public-private partnerships, but I don't remember the details.  It
       may have had to do with the contracting problems with the expansion
       of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.
       That's why I asked.  A liberal activist from Atlanta could better
       answer that, then I.  Haven't lived there since 1979.  (And visited
       family there annually, all my life, until last relative passed
       away.  But, that's not the same as living there, and really having
       a working knowledge of their electoral politics.  I acknowledge
       it.)
       But I definitely have no use for Mayor Reed based upon his
       treatment and eviction of "Occupy."
       Probably I would view these two politicians differently than you,
       if you classify corporatist Dems as "nonpartisans."
       IMHO, these corporatist politicians (of both parties) are the ones
       who've created much of the economic mess we're in now.
       Example:  Clinton going along with abolishing Glass-Steagall.
       Personally, I think it had a GREAT DEAL to do with the Crash of
       2007-2008.  But again, as the leader of the DLC in 1990-1991, he
       was and is a corporatist Dem and fiscal conservative from Arkansas,
       with moderate social views (Oh, I forget, the "PC" term is
       "centrist" according to the MSM, LOL!).  Thank goodness I don't
       have to consider voting for him again, because I definitely
       wouldn't due to his ideology.
       But, look--"to each, their own."  There are a lot of conservative
       Dems, and I accept that they have a right to be conservative, just
       as I have to be liberal.

 My husband thought that there was some fiasco ([870]0+ / 0-)
       surrounding 'water privatization?'  He's not kept up with Atlanta
       politics in a number of years.  But he's on an environmental
       mailing list, and vaguely recalls that something had
       environmentalists up in arms (about water or sewer
       privatization--he believes that he recalls that.  But he added,
       'don't take that to the bank.'  :-)).
       But, according to Wikipedia, I was right about her being a
       corporatist, LOL!
       Anyhoo, here's the [871]link to her Wikipedia page.  It mentions
       that 'she received criticism over her sweeping pro-business
       policies . . . has angered some segments of the city's populace who
       claim these policies are pushing the poor out of Atlanta.'
       And the following is a quote: "Franklin has also been labeled as an
       "anti-homeless mayor" for her policies regarding panhandling, and
       prohibition of public feeding of the homeless."  [Reasonably, one
       might need to restrict panhandling to some extent, but the
       prohibition of public feeding of the homeless is troublesome.]
       Bottom line, if the populace of Atlanta is happy with their mayors,
       so are we.  It doesn't affect us anymore.
       Maynard Jackson was mayor when we lived there, and we liked him.
       Think it's just a manisfestation of "how far right" the Democratic
       Party has drifted over the past 30 years.  I certainly have no
       personal animus toward Franklin or Reed (actually, I don't even
       know anything about their personal lives.)

   If it's Handel, we lose. If it's Price or Cain, we have a shot but it's
   uphill. If it's Broun, it's a tossup.

   I know we'd lose Barrow's seat in the house but isn't it worth that if
   he could take the senate seat? Given how he did in 2012 in his new
   district, he's obviously formidable and knows how to campaign in a
   southern state. Baker wouldn't put any seat in jeopardy but I know less
   about him and therefore just assume Barrow would be more formidable.

   To be sure, the ability for Dems to win this in an off-year in a
   conservative state such as GA with Obama still in power means this is
   completely uphill. But I have to think Broun vs Barrow would really be
   a toss-up.

       You can't create a solid brand when you continuously dilute your

       That in mind, people in some--even most--parts of the country,

   My dear, sainted mother was office manager for an insurance agency

   Republicans -- pillars of their community, generous with their time and
   their fortune, not a mean or hateful bone in their bodies.

   However, a couple of years after I retired from the Army and was living
   near them, my mother relayed to me an invitation from her boss to
   attend a reception for Chambliss.  I told her I would decline.  I went
   to the office and told her boss why I was declining -- because of
   Chambliss' treatment of Max Cleland, I man whom I had known in Vietnam.
    I told him I did not even want to be in the same town with Chambliss
   and thanks for alerting me to the fact that Chambliss would be in town

       I once saw him in a 4th of July parade, waving to the crowd from a
       convertible.  I turned my back and spat.  Got a lot of shocked
       looks but it was the most appropriate thing to do.

 nein, Nein, NEIN! ([1362]1+ / 0-)

   Three Times Nein. Or in the vernacular, 27.

   So, now we know why kain ran for president. He wanted to clear out the
   chaff in anticipation of a future senate run. He knew that given the
   weakness of the entire GOP gaggle, that he would eventually be the
   flavor of the month for at least one primary. That meant that people
   with too much money (Mittster) would do background searches and attacks
   on him.

   Because of that background work, he essentially starts with a clean
   plate. All that stuff is in the past, and no longer remains an issue
   for any future office (see generally Newt Gingrich, Sen. Vitter, and a
   whole slew of other liars and cheats who later sought office or
   reelection and won handily).

   So long as Kain maintains his super conservative creds, his past
   history will be forgiven by the TeaBuggerers. And that puts him in the
   lead for this race.

   (the only unforgivable sins are compromising with the Dems, voting in
   favor of abortion rights, increasing taxes, or voting to cut defense
   expenditures)

   What we call god is merely a living creature with superior technology &
   understanding. If their fragile egos demand prayer, they lose that
   superiority.

 Refresh My Memory ([1369]0+ / 0-)

   When the topic of a primary challenge to Chambliss came up, I thought I
   remember some people suggesting either Cathy Cox (former Dem. Secretary
   of State) or Mark Taylor (former Dem. Lite Gov. and 2006 Gov.
   candidate).

   I just can't remember the reasons they were discounted.

 At Least They're Not Racists ([1372]0+ / 0-)

   Not simple racists, anyway: Cain's a racist, like the [1373]Black White
   Supremacist from Dave Chappelle's Show.

   Being less completely racist, though even more psychopathic, is
   laudable progress for Georgia, and more than I thought I'd see for
   generations. And it starts to look like Georgia's racism is just a
   flavor of its psychopathy. We already have therapies for that, and
   eventually there might even be an app for that.
