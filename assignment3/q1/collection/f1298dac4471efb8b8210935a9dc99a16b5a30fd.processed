New peek into Caroline Kennedy's wealth

   By Jennifer Liberto  [25]@CNNMoney August 19, 2013: 6:03 PM ET

   Federal disclosure documents put Caroline Kennedy's wealth as high as
   $280 million. President Obama has nominated her to be ambassador to
   Japan.
   WASHINGTON (CNNMoney)

Disclosure forms filed by Caroline Kennedy, nominated to become U.S.
ambassador to Japan, give a rare glimpse at the vast wealth of one of the
most high-profile players in Democratic politics.

   The forms tally her net worth as high as about $280 million, according
   to CNNMoney's analysis of the documents. It's hard to get a more
   precise figure because the forms require nominees to disclose their
   money in broad categories.

   But the documents outline details about her riches.

   For example, they show that Kennedy, the daughter of former President
   John F. Kennedy, earned $225,000 making speeches this year, up from
   $100,000 in 2012.

   And in June, Hyperion Books paid Kennedy $437,500 for "participating"
   in the book Jacqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations on Life with
   John F. Kennedy, according to the documents, which were filed last
   month but got widespread notice on Monday after a report in the [26]New
   York Post.

   In addition, Kennedy draws income from dividends and interest from
   financial holdings that span the gambit from bank stocks to
   pharmaceuticals to real estate.

   She has invested in funds with Goldman Sachs ([28]FADXX), Blackstone
   ([29]BGB), Vornado Realty Trust ([30]VNO). She listed between $5
   million and $25 million with Park Holdings Group, which holds oil and
   gas assets.

   She acknowledged that her wealth puts her at risk for potential
   conflicts if she is confirmed.

   "I understand that a heightened prospect of a conflict of interest
   could exist as to the companies that maintain a presence in Japan,
   because they may be more likely than other companies to seek official
   assistance from or make other contact with the embassy," she wrote in a
   letter to the Office of Government Ethics.

   A request for comment from Kennedy was not returned.

   The Senate has yet to hold a confirmation hearing on her nomination.
   Kennedy is set to become the first woman to hold the post. She was a
   top supporter of Obama and served as the co-chair of his vice
   presidential search committee in 2008.

   After receiving degrees at Harvard and Columbia, Kennedy served in a
   variety of roles at nonprofits, including the John F. Kennedy Library
   and the American Ballet Theatre.

   In the disclosure letter, Kennedy said she would resign from various
   nonprofits including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
   Arts.
