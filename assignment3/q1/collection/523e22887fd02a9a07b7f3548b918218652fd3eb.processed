[24]Another Obamacare repeal vote down the drain

   Texas Senate candidate Ted Cruz speaking at the Values Voters Summit
   Ted Cruz, not quite as crazy as Michele Bachmann.
   No, the Senate won't be repealing Obamacare. And yes, there was another
   vote to repeal Obamacare.

   [30]This one came from Sen. Ted Cruz as an amendment to the budget bill
   for 2014. It failed 45-54. Sounding slightly less hyperbolic than his
   counterpart for crazy in the House, [31]Michele Bachmann, Cruz railed
   against the ills of the law.

     "ObamaCare was passed with many promises, and in reality, it has not
     delivered," Cruz said ahead of the vote. "ObamaCare is hurting young
     people, it's hurting seniors, it's hurting Hispanics, it's hurting
     African-Americans, it's hurting the economy and it should be
     repealed."

   How is it hurting all those people? Who knows. That's immaterial. Ted
   Cruz doesn't need evidence. He's Ted Cruz.

   For those counting, Sen. Tom Harkin says this was the [32]36th vote on
   repeal in Congress. Other counts say it's the [33]39th. Either way,
   it's just a tad bit excessive, particularly since it's never going to
   happen.

   Last July, a [34]CBS report determined that the House has spent 80
   hours on futile Obamacare repeal efforts. That was at about the 32nd
   vote. Those 80 hours of wasted time worked out to be about $50 million
   in taxpayer money, the funds spent to keep the House operating. That
   doesn't even count the time the Senate has spent on this idiocy.

   The conclusion is clear: Republicans in Congress are increasing the
   deficit!

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [52]Tagging tips - [53]Search For Tags - [54]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       like California stole the Lakers. But at least Texas had the
       decency to rename the team. The Lakers? In a desert? D'oh! So maybe
       there's hope for sanity in Texas. If they vote out Cruz before
       Minnesota votes out Bachmann can we declare Texas the winner?

     L'Étoile du Nord is a French phrase meaning "The Star of the North".
     It is the motto of the U.S. state of Minnesota. It was chosen by the
     state's first governor, Henry Hastings Sibley, and was adopted in
     1861, three years after admission of Minnesota to the union. Because
     of this motto, one of Minnesota's nicknames is The North Star State.
     The Minnesota North Stars chose the English translation for their
     name.

       the so-called "moderates".

   don't many of the provisions of the ACA NOT kick in until 2014?

   But then, I expect nothing less from my esteemed Senator than

   Is that the Republican Party no longer has any interest, respect, or
   understanding of the legislative process.

   They explicitly reject it.

   They no longer attempt to build consensus to pass bills in the Senate
   or the House.

   They work to gut and overturn laws they don't like by filibustering
   nominees for agencies.

   They have ZERO interest in passing laws by winning a majority of votes.

   They use BLACKMAIL, the threat of destroying the economy, to try to
   force duly elected Democrats to do their bidding.

   And yet Chuck Todd and David Gregory stand around on the "news" shows,
   furrow their brows, and talk about consensus and the legislative
   process as if the GOP has ANY FUCKING INTEREST in passing laws the old
   fashioned way (by passing laws).

   THIS is the major news story of our time.

   It's led to the [340]nauseating decision by Sebelius and the WH to
   allow red states to gut the ACA Medicaid expansion by allowing private

   The GOP definitely knows how to yank the Obama Administration's chain
   to extract as much private profit as possible from ACA, while stealing
   as much as possible from low income, uninsured American workers.

   All these votes have yielded quite a bit of progress for the GOP and

 The GOP-lite wing of the Dem Party.... I would ([371]0+ / 0-)
       imagine that if Barack Obama, who has passed a major healthcare
       legislation that will give millions of people access to health
       care, increased fuel efficiency standards in automobiles, helped to
       do away with DADT, expanded Pell Grants for students seeking access
       to a college education, gave women access to contraceptive care,
       placed two Democratic women on the Supreme Court, and passed the
       Lilly Ledbetter fair pay act can be called a Republican, then I am
       happy to be called a Republican.
       You have developed a skill in taking advantage of any diary that
       speaks about the despicable behavior of Republicans to change the
       topic to the many gripes you have against the President.
       In this case, a diary concerning another Republican attempting, for
       the 30 plus time, to repeal healthcare and you used this wonderful
       opportunity to point out in a sense: Well, forget about Ted Cruz,
       Obama has allowed Republicans to gain an advantage on the
       healthcare issue.
       Your reasoning for this segue is that every time Republicans
       attempt to repeal the ACA, they gain a little in the process. No,
       as the diary so correctly pointed out, every time they try to
       repeal the ACA they get one result: Failure!
       Your attitude appears to be: why discuss how despicable the
       Republicans are, when Obama is even "worse"? In fact, he is a
       Republican, and individuals who support him, as this commenter is
       proud to do, are Republicans....
       Well, here is the issue. Despite your characterizations of the
       President, or perhaps supporters of the President. Your sentiments
       are in the minority. Most people in this nation agrees with the
       President. He won over 65 million votes in the last election and
       was strongly supported by at least 80 percent of Progressives who
       voted for him, according to polls published before the election of
       2012.
       I've seen individuals here vilify this President, because they
       claim he is a Republican, and yet turn around and hoist Rand Paul
       on their shoulders as some type of hero. Yes, the Obama derangement
       Syndrome is alive and well in this community.
       Now in terms of healthcare bill critics on the left, wanting the
       bill to fail? You claim my statement was false? Here is a passage
       from Peter Dreier, writing for the Huffington Post:

     It is incredibly irresponsible for some radicals and progressives to
     call for killing the health care bill. It is important to push for
     changes that would improve the Senate version of the bill. For
     example, the House funding plan (a tax on families with incomes over
     $1 million) is much better than the Senate version (a tax on
     so-called "Cadillac" health insurance plans). That's what the labor
     movement, liberal and progressive Democrats in Congress, pro-choice
     advocates, and others will be doing in hopes of putting a better
     bill on President Obama's desk, as Harold Meyerson discusses in his
     latest Washington Post column.

     But the idea that we should scrap this bill entirely and start from
     scratch next year is both immoral and impractical. Like taking food
     out of the mouths of hungry children, killing this bill will hurt
     tens of millions of real people who are now suffering physically,
     psychologically, and economically.

   It was the Supreme Court who gutted the ACA Medicaid expansion by
   allowing states to opt out of the expansion while keeping their
   existing federal Medicaid money.

   The White House is trying to salvage what it can from that Supreme
   Court decision by allowing the private insurers in, where otherwise the
   alternative is that those states will opt completely out of the
   expansion.

   In other words, you have it exactly backward -- you're accusing Obama
   of gutting it when he is really doing as much as he can to salvage it.
