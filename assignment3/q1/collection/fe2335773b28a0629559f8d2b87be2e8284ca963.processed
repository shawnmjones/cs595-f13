   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [42]Civil
   Rights, [43]Community, [44]Congress, [45]Culture, [46]Economy,
   [47]Education, [48]Elections, [49]Energy, [50]Environment, [51]Health
   Care, [52]International, [53]Labor, [54]Law, [55]Media, [56]Meta,
   [57]National Security, [58]Science, [59]Transportation, or [60]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([61]California, [62]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     U.S. seeks Snowden's extradition, urges Hong Kong to act quickly

     (Reuters) - The United States pressured Hong Kong on Saturday to act
     quickly on its request to extradite Edward Snowden, a former U.S.
     National Security Agency contractor charged with espionage for
     exposing secret U.S. surveillance activities.
     "If Hong Kong doesn't act soon, it will complicate our bilateral
     relations and raise questions about Hong Kong's commitment to the
     rule of law," a senior Obama administration official told Reuters,
     speaking on condition of anonymity.
     Sources say Snowden, who has been hiding in Hong Kong, has sought
     legal representation from human rights lawyers as he prepares to
     fight attempts to force him back to the United States to face trial.
     U.S. National Security Adviser Tom Donilon told CBS News the United
     States had a "good case" against Snowden and expected Hong Kong to
     comply with its 1998 extradition treaty with the United States.

   the more they can make it about Snowden, the more they divert attention
   away from their own anti-constitutional actions.

   Oh, and those "pragmatic" voices yelling that we should assumer that
   all of our phone calls and keystrokes are monitored?  How is that not
   "conspiracy theory"?  Why doesn't that crap get troll-rated as CT?
   Because it comes from power centrists?  Therefore, by definition they
   can't be crackpots?  Quite revealing that such an outlook not only
   prevails, but is seen as unassailable.

       ...the nuanced clarity that Cohen brings to the subject of
       what-is-this-really-about.
       There is need for caution on both sides. I say this as someone who
       has more than once been a target of government surveillance and
       more, sometimes alone and sometimes together with my family. In an
       era of Patriot Acts, I am not sanguine about slippery slopes when
       it comes to my ability to keep government authorities out of my
       business if I am doing nothing wrong except objecting to the way
       those authorities conduct their business. Government authorities
       sometimes do things they shouldn't and lie about it.
       I don't think all surveillance is a bad thing. It should be rare,
       legal and as safe as possible to our civil liberties. Right now, we
       don't have a full picture and we need that to be able to lobby and
       fight for creating the right solutions.

 Obama's Surveillance state keeps growing... ([193]0+ / 0-)

   [194]By Marisa Taylor and Jonathan S. Landay | McClatchy Washington
   Bureau

     President Barack Obama's unprecedented initiative, known as the
     Insider Threat Program, is sweeping in its reach. It has received
     scant public attention even though it extends beyond the U.S.
     national security bureaucracies to most federal departments and
     agencies nationwide, including the Peace Corps, the Social Security
     Administration and the Education and Agriculture departments. It
     emphasizes leaks of classified material, but catchall definitions of
     "insider threat" give agencies latitude to pursue and penalize a
     range of other conduct.

   ...

     "It was just a matter of time before the Department of Agriculture
     or the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) started implementing,
     `Hey, let's get people to snitch on their friends.' The only thing
     they haven't done here is reward it," said Kel McClanahan, a
     Washington lawyer who specializes in national security law. "I'm
     waiting for the time when you turn in a friend and you get a $50
     reward."
