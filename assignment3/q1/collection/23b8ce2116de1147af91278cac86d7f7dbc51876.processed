   -- [30]@JamesFallows
   [31]EJ Dionne:

     The things we forget about the March on Washington are the things we
     most need to remember 50 years on.

     We forget that the majestically peaceful assemblage that moved a
     nation came in the wake of brutal resistance to civil rights and
     equality. And that there would be more to come.

   Someone asked me how long Newtowners would act like they had some kind
   of moral authority on gun issues. I don't know the answer. Does the
   moral authority of John Lewis or MLK have an expiration date?

   -- [34]@jmartNYT
   [35]Michael Tomasky:

     If you thought the GOP would adopt more moderate positions after its
     2012 debacle, you were wrong. From debate threats to defunding
     Obamacare and even more purges, Michael Tomasky on how the
     insanity's only increasing.

   More politics and policy below the fold.

   [36]WaPo:

     Just like that, Cruz summed up his first seven months as a U.S.
     senator and exposed the conundrum he represents for the Republican
     Party: a hero to the conservative base and a worry for the
     establishment.

     Cruz, 42, is a full-bore conservative from Texas whose certitude and
     combativeness in defense of his positions have made him a rock star
     to the GOP's far-right-leaning activists. The comment that brought
     the crowd to it feet was about shredding Obamacare at all costs.

     But that certitude and combativeness also have made him one of the
     most controversial figures in the Senate, a lightning rod for public
     and private criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. The
     question many are left to ponder as Cruz travels the country
     targeting President Obama's health-care law is: What can he
     realistically hope to achieve in a Senate steeped in tradition and
     hierarchy as an eloquent yet sharply polarizing figure?

   [37]NY Times:

     Health officials confirmed Wednesday that bats in Saudi Arabia were
     the source of the mysterious virus that has sickened 96 people in
     the Middle East, killing 47 of them.

     The outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, has been
     going on for 15 months, with most victims falling ill in Saudi
     Arabia and others growing sick after having traveled to the Middle
     East. In a study released Wednesday, an international team of
     doctors blamed coronavirus in bats for the human outbreak, but said
     that many questions remained, in part because a perfect match for
     the virus was found in only a single insect-eating bat out of about
     100 Saudi bats tested. And since such bats do not normally bite
     people, drool on fruit or do other things that might transmit the
     disease to people, it was still unclear how the virus leapt to
     humans.

   [38]Dana Milbank:

     Manning's dignity is a good model for Edward Snowden, the National
     Security Agency leaker now hiding from American justice in Russia.
     Manning admitted what he had done, and he used his trial and its
     conclusion to argue for the righteousness of his cause. That cause
     was artfully described by [Manning's lawyer Lt. Col. David] Coombs,
     who with the shaved head of a military man and the business suit of
     a civilian lawyer, stood before 20 TV cameras and took as many
     questions as reporters could ask.

     "Under the current administration, an unauthorized leak to the media
     of classified information is viewed as being tantamount to aiding
     the enemy," a capital offense, Coombs said. "The government-wide
     crackdown on whistleblowers and the extension of this crackdown to
     journalists threatens to stifle the flow of information that is
     vital to our public." A country in which "you are faced with a
     death-penalty offense" for the simple act of disclosing information
     to a journalist, Coombs added, "is not the America that I would hope
     that we live in."

   [39]Adam Frank, scientist, on the Age of Denial:

     The triumph of Western science led most of my professors to believe
     that progress was inevitable. While the bargain between science and
     political culture was at times challenged -- the nuclear power
     debate of the 1970s, for example -- the battles were fought using
     scientific evidence. Manufacturing doubt remained firmly off-limits.

     Today, however, it is politically effective, and socially
     acceptable, to deny scientific fact. Narrowly defined, "creationism"
     was a minor current in American thinking for much of the 20th
     century. But in the years since I was a student, a well-funded
     effort has skillfully rebranded that ideology as "creation science"
     and pushed it into classrooms across the country. Though
     transparently unscientific, denying evolution has become a litmus
     test for some conservative politicians, even at the highest levels.

     Meanwhile, climate deniers, taking pages from the creationists' PR
     playbook, have manufactured doubt about fundamental issues in
     climate science that were decided scientifically decades ago. And
     anti-vaccine campaigners brandish a few long-discredited studies to
     make unproven claims about links between autism and vaccination.

     The list goes on.

   [40]Tom Edsall:

     The essential political question emerging from this debate is
     whether the forces driving down labor's share of income,
     exacerbating inequality and vastly increasing the wealth of those at
     the top can be redirected to produce more equitable and beneficial
     results while fostering continued growth.

     "What do we do," Noah Smith, an economist at Stony Brook University,
     asks in the Atlantic, "if the `endowment of human capital' with
     which people are born gets less and less valuable?"

     Has the train left the station? Has the momentum behind the
     hollowing out of middle class jobs and the increasing replacement of
     human beings by machines gained so much strength that it cannot be
     reversed? Obama has put the goal of a revived middle class at the
     top of his agenda, but he has not publicly voiced an understanding
     of the size and scope of the problem he seeks to address.

   [41]Aaron Carroll:

     People think that you get care because you have insurance. But I can
     swear to you that no one in this process cared one whit who our
     carrier was. People think you get care like this because you have
     more money. Believe me when I tell you that we are far from the
     richest people in this community. We get care like this because of
     who we are and what we do. We're in the system.

     The first doctor I mentioned had no sick visits available. But they
     squeezed in one of our children because they know I'm a pediatrician
     and they know my wife's a nurse practitioner. They also know us
     personally. You have to remember that about a fifth of Americans
     can't get an appointment when they're sick within a week, let alone
     that day. The dermatologist appointment (for a splinter!) was
     arranged with a close friend at the practice. When our child was
     referred to the ED, I'm sure a call was placed to the urologist
     telling him who my son's dad was and that I worked in the health
     care system, precipitating a level of service that few will see.

     I'm so grateful for what everyone did. Please understand that I'm
     not saying one bit of this was fake. Every doctor we saw was
     unbelievable fantastic and ridiculously skilled. I'm not saying that
     these providers aren't just as kind and caring with every other
     patient. I'm sure they are. We received no scans, no procedures, and
     no medications that someone else wouldn't get. We just got them
     served to us in an ideal fashion.

     That's access. It has nothing to do with insurance or wealth.

   I loved this piece. Carroll's not bragging or unaware, he's wanting
   that kind of access for everyone. "Health reform" is actually
   access+quality+affordability. Obama tries to deal with all three. The
   non-existent GOP plan? Nada.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       does not necessarily equate with blame for why they happened.  It's
       a hard concept to explain to low information voters and some will
       erroneously blame the Obama administration.
       Although I'm no expert and just a casual observer of this tweet
       about the drop in median income, my first thought was median income
       dropped because the Republicans in Congress allowed the Bush tax
       relief on FICA to expire during one of their fits to get their way.
        This hurt every working persons take home pay, but more so those
       earning less than 100K.  Many of those never saw it coming, they
       just suddenly had a drop of 7.5% on their paycheck.
       The really unfair thing about FICA is that those who make over 100K
       don't have the amount they earn over 100K taxed.  And they got
       zinged by expiration of the FICA tax, too, just not to the
       magnitude the people on the bottom did.  Many of them never felt
       the sting.  Now that's inequality in my book and should be changed.

       Full disclosure:  My husband's income is above 100K.  When the tax
       expired, his take home pay dropped less than 2.5%.  How was that
       fair when the working poor and middle class families realized a
       drop in take home pay of 7.5%  It wasn't.  But don't blame Obama.
       It was the Republicans in Congress who allowed it.
       We are all in this together.

       Yesterday, I was listening to the radio, no, it was not wingnut
       radio, it was Sirius radio.  I'm sorry, that I cannot be more
       specific about the source, but I was amazed to learn that almost
       50% of the wingnuts in Louisiana blame President Obama for the
       disastrous response by the federal government after Hurricane
       Katrina!
       Hurricane Katrina!  "Heckuva Job, Brownie!"  Bush was President,
       flying around in a helicopter, looking out the window, on the way
       to cut firewood at the pigfarm in Texas.
       Barack Obama was a newly elected Senator from Illinois.  OBama had
       nothing to do with the response, but the wingnuts will blame Obama
       for anything.
       Why does the sun rise in the East.  The wingnuts don't know why,
       but blame Obama, anyway!

 Here's the breakdown of the PPP Poll ([210]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [211]NM Ray

       released Wednesday:

     Twenty-eight percent (of Republicans) said they think former
     President George W. Bush, who was in office at the time, was more
     responsible for the poor federal response while 29 percent said
     Obama, who was still a freshman U.S. Senator when the storm battered
     the Gulf Coast in 2005, was more responsible. Nearly half of
     Louisiana Republicans -- 44 percent -- said they aren't sure who to
     blame.
       Also, they noted that Governor Swindle only has a 29% approval
       rating vs the 50% the governors on poll released earlier in the
       week claimed and PBO is more popular in Louisiana than Jindal. It
       get's better. Against a head to head with presumptive Democratic
       presidential contender Hillary Clinton, she would beat him (in
       Louisiana mind you) 47% to 40% (13% undecided).
       Pretty sweet.

     Has the train left the station? Has the momentum behind the
     hollowing out of middle class jobs and the increasing replacement of
     human beings by machines gained so much strength that it cannot be
     reversed?

   My granddaughter is four years old.  I try to think of a model in which
   she would be able to earn a living years from now, no matter what
   happens.  If she becomes bilingual in English and Mandarin (her mother
   is Chinese); if she becomes adept in computer technology; if she majors
   in something that will always be needed (for example, medicine)--would
   that enable her to be employed years from now?

   Thanks for the roundup, Greg! The excerpts you've provided offer a
   great deal to think about.

       For mine I worry about their ability to survive possible massive
       disruption and probably civil disorders and worldwide chaos as a
       result of climate change. Even when I discount some of the worst
       effects--and I cannot--of an [307]Antarctic ice sheet collapse or
       [308]ocean current change my even younger youngest granddaughter is
       likely to see real turmoil.
       Think Katrina like dislocations along the coast as currently
       inhabitable areas become uninhabitable. Think nothing worse than
       property value collapse of much of our currently valuable coastal
       property and the dislocations. Think worldwide disruptions as
       probable, not just possible, changes create chaos, food shortages
       and such from rapid changes in arable lands. Think the billiard
       ball effects of the east Asian tribal eruption that led to tribes
       crashing west into the Roman Empire--on a worldwide scale. A job,
       while necessary, may be among the smaller of the worries.
       That is why the idiots saying "do nothing" engender in me an
       "against the wall, fire" instinct in me. Risk assessment 100. You
       act, even spend considerable sums, to mitigate even fairly unlikely
       risks when the consequence of that event is dire.

     A young organizer named John Lewis spoke at the march of living "in

   This is from the article today by EJ Dionne the first link. I added the
   bold.

   There was a diary here yesterday by Ray talking about this. Are you in
   a constant fear of a police state?

   And today, Juan Cole

     Manning was tortured for nearly a year, and that should have been
     sentence enough. Without him, we might not even know about the
     Panopticon of total suveillance in which we are living. Manning
     helped spark a new civil rights movement. He deserves Obama's Nobel

     treatment exposed how zealous the national security state has been,
     ... You don't need to agree with what Manning did to agree with
     Coombs that government secrecy has gone too far.
       Milbank also quoted at length Manning's lawyer setting out the
       pro-disclosure, pro-whistle blower, pro-Manning and pro-pardon
       case.
       Since all of this shows that the club of MSM VSP's have grossly

       in history, it would have been ideal for Dana to remember Grouch

   anniversary and the fact that the Civil Rights movement was about
   non-violence in the face of the brutal resistance that there was was to
   Civil Rights and equality, not only do Newtowners have "moral authority
   on gun issues" - they are THE moral authority on firearms regulations.

   It is so ironic that those who seek to obstruct any reasonable firearms
   regulations (the NRA, their wholly owned congress-critters, and the
   rabid gun nuts) invoke Civil Rights as giving them moral authority to
   defend the status quo, as the key part of the Civil Rights movement was
   non-violence, whereas the key element of violence is maintaining the
   status quo.  Unfortunately they fail to see the irony and keep
   defending a Swiss-cheese of ineffective regulations that allows over
   9,100 children under the age of 18 to get shot and seriously injured
   (of which over 1,400 die every year). If we look at gun deaths of
   children under the definition used by the American Academy of
   Pediatrics (under the age of 21), then it is over 4,600 that die
   annually.  So, depending on which definition of child is accepted, this
   means that gun deaths are the second or third most prevalent cause of
   deaths for children.  Isn't that enough for people to demand change?

   (Data is from CDC WISQARS database and is for the average between 2001
   and 2010.)

   There are thousands, if not millions of other people around the country
   who have lost loved ones to gun violence, going back decades.  They
   have just as much moral authority as the Newtown families, and if we're
   going to get into those kind of comparisons(which I think is a bit of a
   stretch), just as much moral authority as MLK.
   To talk as if the Newtown families have any special moral authority
   greater than all those others is very insulting to them.

 Derangement Diagnosis: Then and Now ([577]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [578]wonderful world

       My recollection is that the symptoms of this "Bush Derangement
       Syndrome" had something to do with accusations by Democrats about
       the fabricated case that led the country into an unnecessary war in
       Iraq.
       I suppose I'm not a good person to judge the matter, but today's
       teapartiers and rightwing nutcases certainly have heartfelt
       political differences with President Obama, but I don't currently
       see anything on the scale of misleading a country into war.  Plenty
       of significant political differences, but that's the way the cookie
       crumbles.
       The way I see it:  The right was deranged then for ignoring the
       evidence in front of their faces when it came to Bush's war in
       Iraq.  And the right is deranged for now elevating political
       differences with Obama into questions of constitutional legitimacy.

   of the GOP that are covered in this roundup alone:

   --science doesn't matter; we create our own facts.  Climate change,
   evolution, the efficacy and importance of vaccines are all victims of
   this new wave of proud ignorance.

   --we should continue to pursue policies that weaken labor and
   exacerbate income inequality

   --voting rights of minorities must be strictly limited

       I daresay that most Republican voters pay more attention to what's
       wrong with Obama than to Republican positions on anything.

     Is there a direct relationship between the amount of billionaire
     donations to politicians and stubborn, dangerous, ignorant policies
     that are pursued?
       If you mean the ones pursued by the Republican Party, I actually
       think it's not so direct. For instance, gun control isn't something
       that most billionaires care about one way or the other, especially
       with respect to their objective interests.The hostility to
       "ObamaCare" is largely partisan politics. The money is very
       important, but I don't think it explains all the crazy.

                Bartlett

       With the exception of religious-based issues like evolution or
       abortion, I think that money factors in.  While I agree that hatred
       of Obama is what politicians SELL to a gullible public, those who
       influence policy do so for economic reasons.
       Guns--there is HUGE money to be made from not regulating guns, and
       the NRA is no longer the gun-safety, hobbyist organization it began
       as.  It is now a lobbying arm of weapons manufacturers.
       Obamacare--the fact that large companies (UPS is just the latest)
       are using it as an excuse to screw over their workers tells us a
       great deal.  Both big companies and the insurance industry do not
       want a law that requires them to cover everybody.  They prefer the
       profit-only model.
       Climate change denial--this is fostered by the fossil fuel industry
       to the tune of billions of dollars.  Politicians on the take from
       these industries express "doubt" about the science because their
       pocketbooks demand it.
       Gutting labor--this is certainly the work of big money.  Limiting
       the power to organize, creating a part-time workforce without
       security or benefits, stealing the pensions of public workers,
       privatizing formerly public work--from education to prisons to
       maintenance of infrastructure--is a way of replacing solid middle
       class union jobs with low-wage ones.  The goal is for the wealthy
       to squeeze a profit from every corner of our society.
       Limiting voting--this is to insure a GOP victory.
       And--although this wasn't mentioned in today's roundup--balancing
       the budget by cutting back on earned benefits of SS and Medicare
       rather than corporate welfare is strictly a money-driven
       philosophy.
       GOP voters support politicians who espouse these policies because
       these same politicians demonize the black guy in the White House.
       They use racism as their sales pitch.  But the policies themselves
       are tailored to further enrich the big money supporters of the GOP.

   I read an interesting diary here last night that more and more
   Republicans are taking advantage of the "keep your kids on the parent's
   policy until they're 26" part of the ACA.

     But while the conservative commentariat has been issuing dire
     warnings about the so-called "Young Invincibles," their parents have
     quietly added millions of them to their family insurance plans, all
     thanks to Obamacare. And as it turns out, Republican parents are
     signing up in greater numbers than Democrats.

   Perhaps as more and more people start using the parts of the ACA that
   benefit them, their politicians will get more pushback to stop the
   "repeal Obamacare" playacting that's going on.

       they have after hours care at all or most of their centers and at
       least one center in the county with 24/7 urgent care. There is no
       need to go to an emergency room for anything short of major trauma
       or a heart attack level problem. One time I had a high fever caused
       by a kidney infection and went to Kaiser. They took me immediately,
       put me on an IV with antibiotics and wrapped me in cold sheets to
       bring down the fever. They wouldn't let me go home until there was
       someone to take care of me. If I'd gone to an ER I'd probably have
       waited hours because I wasn't actively bleeding.
       My mother had Kaiser as her Medicare. Her last illness involved

       I thought it was a major breakthrough this year when I got a
       plumber to come out on the same day.
       (Tip: Rotorooter does plumbing and they'll send a guy right out if
       you use their website to describe your problem -- pretty cool.)

 Vaccine deniers ([805]0+ / 0-)

   It is the cold hand of Darwin's law of natural selection operating
   here. If nature can't find a way to weed out the human species through
   famine or war, then it will eventually find another way. In this case
   through misinformation and eventually an epidemic. Unfortunately for
   all of us, the deniers put everyone in their orbit at risk, not just
   the children who have been selected by their parents to be at risk.

   You will not be punished for your anger. You will be punished by your
   anger.
