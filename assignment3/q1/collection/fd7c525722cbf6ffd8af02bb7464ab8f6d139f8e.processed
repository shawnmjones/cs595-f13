   A Marine Corp colonel spoke out at a Aug. 12, 2013 Concord, New
   Hampshire, council meeting after the Concord Police Department
   requested armored vehicles. This video needs to be shared far and wide.
   [30]The militarization of our local police departments is something we
   should all be concerned with:

   (EDIT: Updated with better version of the video, thanks to
   [32]freekeene.com. Original video below the fold)

   Based on this speech, the city of Concord has postponed the vote on
   armored vehicles until Sept. 9, 2013 at 6 PM. Vote will take place at
   41 Green Street, Concord, New Hampshire.

   More from the Huffington Post on the [33]militarization of police:

     Today in America, SWAT teams are deployed about 100 to 150 times per
     day, or about 50,000 times per year -- a dramatic increase from the
     3,000 or so annual deployments in the early 1980s, or the few
     hundred in the 1970s. The vast majority of today's deployments are
     to serve search warrants for drug crimes. But the use of SWAT
     tactics to enforce regulatory law also appears to be rising. This
     month, for example, a SWAT team raided the Garden of Eden, a
     sustainable growth farm in Arlington, Texas, supposedly to look for
     marijuana. The police found no pot, however, and the real intent of
     the raid appears to have been for code enforcement, as the officers
     came armed with an inspection notice for nuisance abatement.

     Where these teams were once used only in emergency situations,
     they're used today mostly as an investigative tool against people
     merely suspected of crimes. In many police agencies, paramilitary
     tactics have become the first option, where they once were the last.

     "It's really about a lack of imagination and a lack of creativity,"
     says Norm Stamper, a retired cop who served as police chief of
     Seattle from 1994 to 2000. "When your answer to every problem is
     more force, it shows that you haven't been taught and trained to
     consider other options."

   [34]Drawing Down: How to Roll Back Police Militarization in America is
   worth a read. Thanks to [35]lyvwyr101 for the link to the article.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [56]Tagging tips - [57]Search For Tags - [58]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [59]Civil
   Rights, [60]Community, [61]Congress, [62]Culture, [63]Economy,
   [64]Education, [65]Elections, [66]Energy, [67]Environment, [68]Health
   Care, [69]International, [70]Labor, [71]Law, [72]Media, [73]Meta,
   [74]National Security, [75]Science, [76]Transportation, or [77]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([78]California, [79]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Turning thousands of local police departments into small armies in
       an increasingly polarized country amounts to setting up an eventual

       there is a convention going on right now and drone makers are
       looking to expand into US markets
       the author of Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden, was interviewed.
       Listening to the piece on NPR it sounded like it was intended to
       soften us up to seeing drones in the sky as normal.
       yes they had security concerns people like ACLU saying that one
       should not have to look up to sky before leaving home to see if a
       drone will be following you for the day
       *
       In Jeremy Scahill's book "Dirty Wars" he says that Obama used as
       many drones in his first 10 months in office as W Bush used in 8
       years.
       And the drones are part of the 'killing machine' in the special
       operations groups like JSOC which have been given wide latitude and
       report to the administration
       *
       so tactics learned in war get applied here at home
       including militarization of the police force
       which is obvious these days and one expects to get worse
       divineorder thanks to the link to your diary as well. Further info

       your logic is.
       What you gun controllers wont get, and another reason you insist on
       only debating straw horses, is that fear of the state becoming a
       tyranny is one of the primary reasons 2nd amendment advocates do
       so.

 youre wrong ([1123]0+ / 0-)
       keeping weapons out of the hands of the working classes lest they
       overthrow the elites goes back thousands of years. Those
       broadswords you see in movies? if a serv or slave were found with
       one in medieval england his punishment would have been severe. in
       japan a commoner owning a sword would have ended in execution. in
       china even a long blade or club would have ended in death. in
       america in particular gun control is based Entirely in racism...
       whites sure didnt want those ex slaves armed.
       And even now the truth is gun control is all about keeping guns out
       of the hands of young black and hispanic males and poor whites.
       Noone seemed to have a problem with Diane Feinstein comitting a
       felony by making a straw purchase or owning a handgun. But the gun
       controllers here would lose their minds at the sight of a 22yo
       black male with an one.. even though he was say.. a war veteran.
       it's pure racism, classism and fetishism. Because yes we've noticed
       you people seem obsessed with sexualising firearms.

       I keep hearing from a certain small but significant subset of the
       pro-gun folks that an armed citizenry is our best defense in the
       event our government becomes tyrannical.
       Let me to put this as succinctly and clearly as I can -- and I say
       this as someone who served four years in the United States Army in
       a combat arms role and got a good, close look at the glittering
       array of death-dealing machinery that our tax dollars have bought
       huge piles of: If the people I see on TV talking about the "Tree of
       Liberty being watered with the blood of tyrants" were to (and yes,
       this is deeply silly, but just for fun...) actually succeed in
       beginning the Great Birther and Anti-Kenyan Rebellion of 2013 or
       whatever, and the U.S. military were given free rein to use all
       that previously mentioned hardware to suppress the uprising, the
       result is beyond doubt: The rebels would be absolutely annihilated.
       I mean, seriously. Our duck guns and deer rifles -- heck, even .50
       caliber Barrett sniper rifles and home-made pipe- and truck bombs
       -- would be going up against the 82nd Airborne Division, the U.S.
       Marine Corps, the Air Force, armored divisions, cluster bombs,
       artillery, predator drones, B-52 raids, and so on. It would be a
       short, brutal, and almost unimaginably violent war.
       If the only thing standing between us and tyranny is our guns, we
       are well and truly fucked.
       The best defense against tyranny is not an armed citizenry. It is
       an educated citizenry.
       The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are
       always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of
       doubts. -Bertrand Russell

 And the War of Independence was what? ([1150]0+ / 0-)
       An armed movement against the tyrannical British Monarchy.
       Unfortunately, it took intelligent armed men to wrest control of
       this country from the oppressive, greedy British king of the time
       in order to give us the freedoms we enjoy which have been under
       attack more and more lately esp since 9/11. Alas, this can also
       work the other way in small countries giving the greedy the power
       thru military coups usually due in part to lack of power from the
       commoners.
       Our forefathers set up the ability for the people to defend
       themselves from oppression and/or harm. Ultimately, the the
       Constitution is there to ensure the freedom of pursuit of happiness
       (as long as it doesnt bring harm to another of course). Gun
       control, tends to harm and infringe more  on law abiding citizens
       going out hunting and simply having a fun day at the range.
       Defending yourself is another, as stand your ground isn't needed,
       but if your trapped, or on your property, there is no more retreat.
       You need to be able to defend yourself anyway you can. I do think
       any gun owner should take a self defense class before purchasing a
       weapon, just so it doesnt always seem like the gun is the only
       answer.

 Yes, its was ([1158]0+ / 0-)
       But was it wrong?
       Some argue slavery, some states rights, ultimately, Southerns didnt
       want to be told what to do by Washington, much like the forefathers
       didnt want to be told what to do (and owe) by the king. However,
       yes they lost, Yes, slavery was an infringement upon the rights of
       "colored" folk. So was the Southerner's loss for the better? Yes,
       but that does not diminish the fact that they choose to stand up
       for what they wanted, and armed was going to be the only way.

 If the Founding Fathers ([1162]0+ / 0-)
       looked about 50 years ahead, and foresaw that the UK would ban
       slavery in the 1830's, their rebellion may ALSO have been about
       wanting to remain "free" to hold slaves.  Certainly there must have
       been some philosophical and religious discussion about slavery as
       early as the 1770's (and the Church of England would be expected to
       help enforce a future abolition by its domination of religious life
       and its control by the Crown).  But they took the high road and
       justified it by concepts such as freedom and equality, which,
       fortunately, their descendants were finally forced to acknowledge.
       We need an Amendment to affirm that the Fifth Amendment REALLY
       meant it when it said that private property is not to be taken for
       public purposes without COMPENSATION and in accordance with DUE
       PROCESS; that "public purposes" does NOT mean "so we can deprive
       you of it just for being ACCUSED of a crime, and sell it for our
       profit" and "due process" does NOT mean "just by filing an order
       with a biased court that you will have to pay more than its value
       to a lawyer to contest." The seizure of private property by "civil
       forfeiture" is the FUEL SUPPLY for this travesty of justice, and
       must be stopped.
       By the way, even though slaveholders tried to stop abolition by
       quoting the Fifth above, the Thirteenth Amendment affirmed in law
       what was already theoretically true according to the Declaration of
       Independence, that slaves were actually human beings, with the same
       rights as slaveholders, illegally held captive.  Your house, car
       and bank account are NOT human beings with rights; they are ONLY
       property (of course, a mistreated animal would be another matter).

   Recommended by:
          [1171]jds1978, [1172]lightarty

   ...gun worship about the Revolutionary War.  It's this ridiculous
   mythology about some plucky militia armed only with their courage and
   wits and a rifle and how they were able to overthrow the tyranny of
   the British.  Look, I'm pretty darn grateful for the liberties and
   freedoms I enjoy as an American as the result of the actions of our
   Founding Fathers, but let's not kid ourselves.  The British had an
   immense logistical challenge in resupply across the Atlantic, the
   French, Spanish, and Dutch all supplied weapons, and, later, open
   involvement opposing the British, and lets not forget the standing
   army, the Continental Army.

   Which segues to my next point.  Nearly every time there is a
   revolution, if that revolution does not enjoy the support of some other
   nation state, it's doomed.  I'm sure we could have a long, interesting
   conversation about 20th century revolutions or attempted revolutions
   like Vietnam, the Boer Wars, Libya, the Tamil Tigers, and more, but in
   my mind it all boils down to which foreign power are you going to
   accept aid from to support your little rebellion against your perceived
   tyranny.

   And finally, I simply don't understand how people can go from arguing
   that a gun is simply a tool and then turn around and argue that guns
   magically stop tyranny.  Which is it?  If we're to abide by the
   craptastic sentiment of 'guns don't kill people, people kill people'
   then we must also say 'guns don't win revolutions, people do'.

   If we are truly a representative democracy and we get to the point
   where the only option to defend against tyranny is to take up arms,
   we've already lost and the United States of America is already a
   memory.

       The blimp floating over an NCAA or NFL stadium could have cameras
       capable of zooming in on individual seats and checking on what fans
       are drinking or smoking.  They could also zoom in on surrounding
       property for quite a distance (starting, but not ending, with the
       fans' cars in the parking lot).  Draw a 45 degree cone with the
       blimp at the vertex, and the edge of that cone, where it hits the
       ground, is only about 40 percent farther from the blimp than the
       point directly below it.  And the route from the blimp base to the
       stadium and back ...

   It turned otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals, and made far
   more people subject to attack by the police. It expanded the duties of
   the police to include non-violent people who weren't stealing from
   anyone or harming others in any way.

   That started the mind change, and everything else followed. This is the
   logical conclusion.

   Or maybe, it was, "Dumber than a bag of hammers" for Bush, and "Hope

       Jens Stoltenberg said on July 27, 2011 after the horrible mass
       murders of "liberal" children in his country:

     I have a message to the people who attacked us, and those behind
     them. This is a message from all of Norway:

     You will not destroy us.
     You will not destroy our democracy nor our quest for a better world.
     We are a small nation, but we are a proud nation.
     We must never cease to stand up for our values. We have to show that
     our open society can pass this test, too. And that the answer to
     violence is even more democracy, even more humanity, but never
     navet.
       Can you imagine an American President saying such a thing,
       especially that last sentence?
       No, an American President will always say

     ...that the answer to violence is less freedom for our citizens, and
     more atrocities around the world, and drone attacks, and torture,
     and "kill lists", and spying on our citizens, and more prisons, and
     militarily-equipped police forces, and suppression of political
     dissent.
       That's become the American way, sad to say.

     Norway's prime minister Jens Stoltenberg worked secretly as a taxi

     wondering whether their elected leader had quit the day job. The
     Labour leader, who is campaigning for re-election on 9 September,
     said he chose the unusual tactic so that he would hear what people
     really thought. Stoltenberg confirmed his identity only after his

   in any way. I wholeheartedly agree, armed drones have no business
   operating on domestic soil. Period. And surveillance drones should be
   used sparingly (and with a warrant) at best.

   But rest assured, the only reason the Bush regime didn't use drones on
   the same expansive scale as the Obama administration is is because the
   high level of technology available now simply didn't exist before 2009.

   Technology has at least doubled drone capabilities since the Bush [DEL:
   era :DEL] error.

       the political Left fighting against him. Now? Not so much.  The
       left has chosen not to fight against the same things if it's a
       president with the same policies but a D next to his name.
       You need a Democratic president to carry out things that radical

       opposition from the now silent Left.

       back then because all but the bravest of Democrats were afraid to
       be called soft on terror.
       But this is spot on...

     You need a Democratic president to carry out things that radical
     right-wing presidents want to do but can't do because of too much
     opposition from the now silent Left.
       ... as evidenced by "entitlement reform." Before Obama, no
       Democratic POTUS had even thought about stepping into that
       particular minefield.

       You can damn well expect that if crashed drones that kill people
       are on official business, there will never be any criminal
       penalties, only civil where taxpayer end up screwing themselves.
       You know, just like the police now, who can "accidentally" kill
       with near impunity. Worst thing that happens is the taxpayers get
       stuck paying for the civil fines.

   is an excellent historical book.
   Should be a must read.
   I have listened to half of it, and it is really an eye opener about
   what the US military stands for.
   Or WHO it stands for.
   The US has so much blood on its hands.
   The movie showed in my lil town, but I missed it.
   Hopefully it will come out on DVD soon.
   A diary by Don would be great, but all should read it.
   Over 1000 bases in so many countries protecting not us, but US
   interests.
   And we pay for it, but the corporations get the profits, and pay no
   taxes.
   Counter pounch has a great article about DC being thecwar crimes
   capital.
   I urge folks to go read it.
   Down close to the bottom of the page.

   The Empire has fallen, we're a post-colonial power in the making. The

   Status and rank through conformity, class rankings and stuff like
   houses and cars.
   Uniforms for all. How can you tell he's an outlaw biker if he's out of

   I suggest we look beyond them for a model - back to our great-grand and
   grandparents.  We're already in a neo-Gilt Age, Prohibition ridden,
   socially liberating, revolutionary time.

   The Roaring 20s and Economically ruinous 30s were very similar to now.
    Weed and cocaine were legal, in big cities openly gay couples danced
   and Harlem was the center of intellectual and musical greatness.  Sex,
   drugs and hot jazz. Radio. Telephones and electricity.  Rumble seats
   and hip flasks.  Aeroplanes.

   a remark that I've made too many times in the past decade or so, and

   This country has changed in ways just unimaginable and in just a decade
   or so.

   Who could have ever begun to imagine that we would be engaged in
   America's longest war, and hoping for only another 1 and half years to
   go?

   Those born in 2001 who will soon be teen-agers have never known their

       the trailers for the Judge Dredd movie, although I did not watch

       played the robotic "Judge" who was authorized to inflict capital
       punishment on the spot for the least appearance of "street crime."
        I also remember the Dick Tracy parody character Fearless Fosdick
       who sometimes appeared in Al Capp's Li'l Abner strip.  Every day he
       appeared he left behind a trail of dead civilian bodies because of
       his "careless" aim.  The Lt. Drebin character of Leslie Nielsen in

 Drone fear. What should we worry about. ([1995]0+ / 0-)

   As long as the Domestic Drone program is an "unarmed" program I don't
   see that we have much of an issue. Every Federal and State police
   organization has some form of fixed wing or helicopter capability to
   monitor their air space. They have rules on what they can and cannot do
   in those areas. All they have done so far is take the pilot out of the
   cockpit and put them in a simulator on the ground. This enables them to
   fly longer flights and coordinate better. It's less dangerous to fly a
   drone and takes less fuel to fly it. So there is a cost benefit right
   there and an increase in efficiency with your manpower.

   So far all I am hearing are "what ifs" about future capabilities that
   "could be" implemented that would be illegal. Yes, that is a concern
   and we need to make sure we write legislation to prevent it from being
   possible for our children's sake. But the implementation of drones in
   the skies is similar to when fixed wing aircraft first flew the skies.
   People were frightened about it. Rules had to be made to prevent abuse.
   But we have the technology and it isn't going away just because they
   were used by the military overseas. We are simply adapting a technology
   to improve what we already do domestically with police and federal
   agents in the skies. Taking the people out of the cockpit is actually a
   safer more cost effective change.

   "Walking this back" should actually be mandatory---for the people in

   People are dying because of these out of control military style
   tactics.

   Scaling this down is safer for all of us: and it's safer for
   cops---too.

    So many people in this community and others pushed hard to overturn
   our draconian---insane (if you ask me) drug laws---Stop and Frisk---and
   mandatory sentencing guidelines---and we actually made progress.

   Demilitarizing police depts should be a priority as well.

   And we will make progress there--too.

   For the same reasons we've made progress in other areas---because we
   need to---because we have to.

   Anything that has a bodycount is an area that needs to be addressed.

       scaling down the local and regional police departments because a
       lot of this militarization is happening with federal money from
       Homeland Security and Pentagon surplus. The amount of military
       "surplus" equipment being acquired by local/regional/state law
       enforcement has increased dramatically in the last few years.
       So local tax payers can object to funding this kind of thing in
       their police departments, but if the money is not coming from the
       local taxes, then it would require organizing at the national level
       to stop the things being done with federal funding.
       It's hard to believe that with all the things being cut, we're
       still pouring money into security and surveillance, but we are.  I
       doubt that most people know the numbers. I don't know them off the
       top of my head. And the last time I looked at the numbers on the
       Pentagon surplus was circa 2011 and there had been a drastic
       increase under Obama.

       Passed after the end of Reconstruction, this act prohibits the use
       of federal military personnel to enforce State laws, which,
       generally speaking, means that the U.S. Army, Marines, Navy, etc.
       can't be used for law enforcement on U.S. soil.  What it doesn't
       mean is that domestic security and/or law enforcement entities

       economist Joseph Stiglitz told Greg Palast in his book, The Best
       Democracy Money Can Buy that the dirty secret of the World Bank is
       that for each country they claim they are going to do a customized
       plan for economic recovery, but each time the plan has these same 4
       steps:
       1. Privatize (briberize) the Public Works.  This means sale the
       country on a Bechtel construction big works plan such as a dam or
       something.  If the government first doesn't agree, then bribe them
       until they do.
       2. Eliminate Any Type of Socialism.  This means get rid of public
       schools, public hospitals, etc.
       3. Eliminate all the worker wages.  This means destroy all unions
       and cooperatives.
       4. Prepare for the Revolt.
       What got me active in politics is when I read this book and
       realized HOLY SHIT this is happening HERE.  There is no allegiance
       to this country.
       I believe we're on Step 4 right now.

       GREAT BOOK (and a riveting spy novel read--and would be fun if it
       weren't for the fact that it is all true). It explains how these
       countries fall for these crazy economic schemes vis-a-vis CIA

 Agreed. The HuffPost article ought to be ([2226]0+ / 0-)

   required reading for all citizens.  It's wordy but otherwise excellent,
   providing a great many facts and opinions.  For example, 34 BILLION
   dollars:

     Since Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government has handed out some $34
     billion in grants to police departments across the country, many for
     the purchase of battle-grade vehicles and weapons.

   That's in addition to many programs and grants encouraging activity
   against the smallest of drug infractions.  I found much of it
   surprising.

   The MSM incorrectly reported that the younger brother, who did not have
   a gun, shot the MBTA policeman, who was in actuality shot by friendly
   fire.  [2238]Witnesses suggest friendly fire felled MBTA officer

   If you dare to inform anyone of this fact, they tell you that you are

   People believe the incorrect narrative that was repeated like a broken

       The Plutocracy's Goons are the CIA, they protect the ruling class
       in every way they can and the spreading of propaganda is a hugely
       effective way to do- especially when people have no idea it's being

       If it was this way 50 years ago, a time when most thought the press

   Ever worked in a company department which was somehow given a bigger
   budget than they needed or deserved?  the trick is to find things to
   blow it on.  They embark on a ridiculous spending spree.

   If one police department doesn't steal the taxpayer candy, surely
   another will.  The Department of Homeland Security is a monster that
   will take decades to reel in, meanwhile, the wealth of our generation
   is going to be pissed away on these types of GI Joe action adventure
   toys.

   And rest assured, they WILL be used against the population when shit
   hits the fan.  I can't imagine what the 1968 Dem convention in Chicago,
   MLK assassination riots, Kent State, and all the other incidences of
   civil unrest would be with all these new toys in the mix to play with.

       don't blow all your budget, when the next round of budgeting comes
       around, the programs/offices who were frugal get their budgets cut,
       because they obviously didn't need it all last time.

       there.
       I was up in the choir loft, leaning across the rail to get a shot
       of the pipe array. I momentarily lost my balance, and in the effort
       not to tumble to the stone floor below, I dropped the camera.
       A $25,000 Arriflex 35mm camera.
       Driving back to the Pentagon, I was certain I'd be court martialed,
       or, at the very least, have my paycheck docked through eternity.
       (We didn't earn a whole lot back then.)
       Upon returning to my unit, I made my report to the Captain, who
       ordered me to stand by while he went in and briefed the Colonel.
       After a bit, I heard laughter from behind the closed door. Then the
       Captain came out and told me, "Don't worry about it. It's fine. Get
       another camera and head back to West Point."
       It wasn't until months later, when I was out drinking with the
       First Sarge, that I got the skinny. I had fortuitously destroyed
       that camera just weeks before the end of the fiscal year. Sarge
       said he was surprised I hadn't gotten a medal for my service to our
       agency.
       Let the 28th Amendment be one to amend the amendment process

   Essential spending is being curtailed so that more police dept's can
   steal the taxpayer candy.  Where are Simpson and Bowles when you need
   them?

   One of the many tragedies of this presidency is that many essential
   national debates are not taking place.   How many billions have been
   pissed away in the past 20 years on St. Ronnie's star wars fantasy, and
   how many more will be pissed away in the next 3 years?  In an age of
   austerity, why isn't that Cold War boondoggle being shut down?   How
   much is DHS spending so that local police dept's can do their [2932]Lt.
   Howard Hunter routine?   Why not follow Clint Eastwood's advice (which
   got a big cheer at the 2012 RNC) and pull out of Afghanistan tomorrow?
    There are other essential questions not being asked.

   In closing, I'd also note that seeing a major city on lockdown for an
   entire day while a 20-something thug was shivering under a backyard
   boat tarp was a significant development in this alarming trend.

 This is very interesting. ([3006]0+ / 0-)

   I wonder what would happen if a slew of cities followed Detroit and
   went bankrupt. How many would it have to be before the federal
   government had to step in? "Sure, we'll provide financial help, but the
   cops work for us now." Or even worse, they outsource the job to
   corporations who have been building stockpiles of cash.

   I'm not generally the tin foil hat type, but I have this nagging
   feeling that the feds are preparing us for something. Post-peak oil,
   catastrophic climate change; something that is going to significantly
   disrupt the social fabric. I know that there are some pretty smart
   people working for the government, in spite of its idiotic public
   policy face. I hope I'm wrong, but I suspect that it won't be too long
   before we look back at these times as "the good old days."

       A snip to encourage others to read:

     "If the HPSCI [House permanent select committee on intelligence]
     leadership withheld a document, intended by the administration for
     release to non-committee members - a document that could have led to
     a different outcome when the Patriot Act was reauthorized in 2011 -
     this is tantamount to subversion of the democratic process," said
     Bea Edwards, the executive director of the Government Accountability
     Project.

     "Americans have the right to know exactly who made this decision and
     who carried it out." ....
     Amash told the Guardian on Monday that he had confirmed with the
     House intelligence committee that the committee did not make
     non-committee members aware of the classified overview from 2011 of
     the bulk phone records collection program first revealed by the
     Guardian thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden. The document was
     expressly designed to be shared with legislators who did not serve
     on the panel; it appears that a corresponding document for the
     Senate in 2011 was made available to all senators.
     "Nobody I've spoken to in my legislative class remembers seeing any
     such document," Amash said.
     Amash speculated that the House intelligence committee withheld the
     document in order to ensure the Patriot Act would win congressional
     reauthorization, as it ultimately did.

   That's why they're treating us like enemies when we have treated them
   like our lawful government. In fact, despite many biting and caustic
   comments, the vast majority of Americans have treated their government
   with considerable respect while under incredible stress--respect the
   government has done little, IMO, to earn.

   In response to what I think is a remarkably civic and nonviolent
   response by the American people to the Wall St scandal (and that's what
   it is--an unprosecuted crime of vast scope), the government has decided
   to treat us all like enemies. We give them a profoundly decent
   response; they give us unwarranted abuse. And it's because they are
   literally seething with guilt. They view us as enemies, whether we view
   them as such or not.

   gunner manning a machine gun, which he was rotating around and on
   occasion pointed in our direction, aboard a Coast Guard speed boat
   circling us at high speed.  How dangerous to us was that maneuver?

   Was that really necessary?

   I know the POTUS is on island, but I doubt he was on that ferry.  That
   bouncing speed boat with a machine gun was a danger to all of us.  No
   wonder there are so many "friendly fire" incidents!  Locked and loaded
   against a passenger ferry?  This day tripper just wanted to have a nice
   beach day and didn't deserve to be in the cross hairs of a machine gun,
   for heaven's sake.

   It's nuts.

   I've never seen such a thing.  People were taking photos of it, as did
   I, and when I said that I thought it was outrageously dangerous to all
   of our safety on board, this southerner drawled, "We're on high alert."
    I said, I don't believe anything the government spokespeople say
   anymore.  So much of what they've frightened us with has been debunked
   and when you dig deeper you see that they didn't tell you all that they
   knew and all that they were actually involved with, and they are
   constantly misleading us.  He didn't answer me.  I hope I gave him some
   food for thought.

       to go camping. Backpack filled with dangerous things like weed and
       granola bars.

   Congressperson and Senators and let them know that as a Taxpaying
   Citizen, you did not appreciate your government funds being used to AIM
   a machine gun at civilian passengers on a ferry boat, regardless of
   security.

   Tell them the day and time that the Coast Guard behaved this way.

   I bet you it will filter down.

   My cousin worked as a staffer for a Congressman and he handled things
   like this all the time. It goes something like this:  "Please provide
   the Congressman with an explanation as to why Coast Guard personnel
   were aiming live machine guns at civilians on board the ferry."

   And they'd have to explain. It might be a bit of a deterrent the next
   time around if someone is called on the carpet for his actions.

     "The State of New Hampshire's experience with terrorism slants
     primarily towards the domestic type," the filing reads. "We are
     fortunate that our State has not been victimized from a mass
     casualty event from an international terrorism strike however on the
     domestic front, the threat is real and here. Groups such as the
     Sovereign Citizens, Free Staters and Occupy New Hampshire are active
     and present daily challenges."

     While the sovereign citizens movement has a history of racism and
     violence, Police Chief John Duval now says that he doesn't actually
     believe the Free State Project or Occupy New Hampshire are domestic
     terror threats. "I wish I would have worded things different in
     retrospect," he says. "I understand why their eyebrows are raised
     about that." He chalks up the wording to the limitations of writing
     a detailed proposal in only three pages and says it was meant to
     refer to the "unpredictable nature of unpredictable people who
     attach themselves to otherwise lawful situations."

   the Michigan State Police used to shut down the Hutaree militia group?
   They were using tanks.

   Years ago (pre 9/11), we were asked by Governor Engler to design a
   joint facility housing the State Police headquarters and the National
   Guard headquarters. It was basically a Pentagon at the state level and
   fortunately it was never built.

       I see the case of the Hutaree as one of the few instances where a
       paramilitary police response was actually appropriate and
       understandable. There you had a group that was known to be heavily
       armed and who were building explosive devices. They expressed a
       specific intent to attack police with IEDs similar to those used by
       insurgents in Iraq. I can't say I blame the cops for wanting to go
       into that situation in an armored vehicle rather than some squad
       cars.

   of police forces for many years. This issue seemed to creep up on us so
   slowly that we failed to notice. A police officer used to wear a suit
   jacket, shirt, tie and slacks. Now, the standard police uniform is
   basically combat gear.

   Now here's my beef, and this is just the opinion of an average citizen.
   In no way am I an expert. The psychological impact of dealing with cops
   dressed for combat is profound. The uniform seems to dehumanize the cop
   now whereas back in the day the business like dress of the police gave
   him/her an air of respectable authority while at the same time allowed
   people to still see a real person.

   Well, as I say, that's just my amateurish observation, and I could be
   completely off base, but I can say that I have little to no respect for
   cops today and view them more as heavily armed thugs enforcing the
   rules on behalf of their  elitist masters, the ruling plutocracy.

   spinach raid but the basic fact is you have the War on Drugs to thank
   for your local militarized police.

   relegalization/regulation (whichever term makes you less uncomfortable)
   of marijuana is at the center of repealing some of this nonsense.
   Legalized and regulated marijuana will put a massive dent in this. It
   will cause many police officers and 'certain federal agents" to join
   the ranks of the unemployed because they will not be needed.

   Law Enforcement arrests over 800000 Americans for nothing each and
   every year. Those are 800000 arrests that did not need to occur.

   This alone is a massive waste of money and law enforcement resources,
   not to mention a huge burden on our supposedly over-worked court
   system.

   I will continue to say it: Cops are completely out of control:

     Where these teams were once used only in emergency situations,
     they're used today mostly as an investigative tool against people
     merely suspected of crimes. In many police agencies, paramilitary
     tactics have become the first option, where they once were the last.

   Legal means "good".

   It is revolting and the US is rapidly becoming a militaristic
   nation-state with constitutional guarantees having been thrown out the
   window.  To this disabled Vietnam veteran who served honorably, the
   movement in the US to a militarized police presence throughout the
   country, at all levels of government, is a very, very scary thing.  It
   causes me to fear that the US is changing and will become a far more

       then I would say that the onus is on them not to behave as if they
       were military organizations. Just read this [4259]blog post from
       the New Yorker and tell me that the militarization of the police is
       not a problem.

     Thousands of police departments nationwide have recently acquired
     stun grenades, armored tanks, counterattack vehicles, and other
     paramilitary equipment, much of it purchased with asset-forfeiture
     funds. In addition, as ABC reports, a U.S. Department of Defense
     program, often called the Pentagon Pipeline, has redistributed
     billions of dollars' worth of surplus military gear to local police
     forces, a significant portion of it repurposed from Iraq and
     Afghanistan. (For example, a Humvee was used to patrol a school
     campus.) These acquisitions have no doubt helped to transform
     full-scale, bust-down-the-door raids on homes and businesses from
     red-alert rarities, reserved for life-threatening scenarios, to
     commonplace occurrences.

   don't bother. Seriously. I'm assuming you didn't read the linked piece,
   which gives an example of a heavily armed police raid of an art
   gallery. But I suppose you think that those patrons (who ended up
   having all of their cars confiscated for no reason) were major threats
   to the police, a huge criminal conspiracy?

   I'm not asking that as a serious question, because I am sure, if you

       You've got one instance....shit, maybe dozens...of instances where
       firepower wasn't needed so you say it shouldn't be available?
       Nuts to that. No way would I go raid a marijuana farm, an organized
       crime den, a militia base, or a hundred other places without
       serious body armor and firepower.  You see, not all .50 cal sniper
       rifles are bought for target shooting.  Not all extended mags are
       bought for shooting up movie theaters.  They are bought to kill
       government agents.  The people who own them occasionally say so.
       It's pretty glib, don't you think, to pretend that there are no
       huge criminal conspiracies that are heavily armed.  It's pretty
       shallow to sneer at the dangers law enforcement faces in a country
       where they are, even now, literally outgunned.
       But you can't even admit such dangers exist.  That's your level of

       you'd expect guns to be the main cause of death of police officers.
       But they aren't. Car crashes are the number one cause of death for
       police officers, by a large margin. This drug war has completely
       twisted our society to the point where someone growing pot is
       instantly assumed to be deadly. It's absurd.
       And of course there are large drug cartels that have weapons. But
       can you point out where they've been in a shoot out with the police
       over a relatively small pot crop? You're basically saying that we
       should treat every situation as if there are horribly dangerous
       weapons even though there is an incredibly small chance of that
       actually being a danger. Classic over-reaction due to fear.

       should have had a SWAT team with them? Again, do you have numbers
       for the weapons that you are claiming exists as a problem, not just
       "gunfire" as a general category. And really, compare that to the
       number of people that police have killed this year so far and
       you'll see the problem. At least five times the number of police
       that have been killed.

     But death is a small price for someone else to pay so that you don't
     have to look at scary Humvees and body armor.
       If you really think that having a military grade police force
       intimidating the public isn't an issue then there is no
       conversation. The only thing you care about is protecting the
       reputation of the police. You clearly could care less about the
       actual actions of the police and you're willing to make up threats
       to do so. Th weapons you claim are so prevalent don't kill cops at
       any significant level and never have. And you haven't even bothered
       to support your claim otherwise.
       Those numbers seem too low in that link. 62 cops have been killed
       in the line of duty in the entire country? Are there other sources?

       a great many protests. And I've seen more than one person talk
       about them being used to intimidate protesters. Not to mention the
       times they do shit [4358]like this where they kill innocent people
       because they have the same unjustified fear of weapons that you do.
       Marijuana shouldn't even be illegal and you support killing people
       over it because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
       Because that is what this is about despite your shitty personal
       attacks on people who disagree with you. Luckily the country is
       noticing the increasingly outrageous behavior of the police, which
       is why the people who will defend the police at any cost are
       becoming increasingly shrill and disconnected from reality.

     That's your big worry while you challenge me to find enough dead
     cops that you give a shit.
       No, I challenged you to find one shred of evidence that these swat
       teams are dealing with the sort of situations you are supposedly
       worried about. By your rationale we should be invading Iran already
       because they might have nuclear weapons, even though there's no
       proof at all that it's a problem. You are desperate to paint the
       police as being horribly in danger from some shadowy force of drug
       cartels using legally bought weapons to kill cops and yet you can't
       point out a single shred of evidence that it's actually a problem.
       So show me there's actually a problem or you have nothing except
       outrage at people who supposedly don't care about the police. You
       clearly know too many police officers to think rationally about
       this issue.

       Yes, people have been intimidated by them. I've been intimidated by

       care less about how protesters are treated, as long as the police

     You've got nothing but a belief that the mere possibility of someday

       No, I know people who decided not to go back to protests because

       You can pretend that it doesn't happen all you want, that doesn't
       change reality.
       And you're noticeably silent about the innocent people killed by
       these SWAT teams. And I'm the one that doesn't care about lives.

     I, at least, have the sense to note that guns in the hands of

     You obviously could care less about how protesters are treated,

       wearing body armor and having guns is a "treatment" in and of
       itself.
       I think it's great, I really do, that the closest you come to being
       scared is seeing police officers well armed.  I'm glad nobody is
       shooting at you.   I'm glad that you face police officers rather
       than criminals.  It's the way life is supposed to be.
       I don't know why you feel the need to make it more dangerous for

       Hey, you're the one arguing for more weapons to a group that
       regularly kills people, not me. You completely ignore all the
       innocent people killed by cops. That's what this is about even more

   Yes yes yes! Dangers!

   Seriously: if the police are raiding an organized crime den, or
   something similarly dangerous, then yes, they should be properly
   equipped. This can include body armor and heavier weapons, etc.

   And yes, our nation's refusal and inability to enact strong gun control
   compounds the hazards. Yes. This is true. Point conceded.

   Nevertheless...this does not mean that the police should get to have
   and use whatever weapons and equipment that they want, especially on
   raids where no such danger is reasonably expected to be present. Again,
   I think that the ACLU round-up I linked above gives a lot of
   information as to why this is dangerous. Small town police departments
   are getting grants from DHS to buy armored vehicles!

   Do you honestly think that the Richland County Sheriff's Department
   will [4422]ever need an armored vehicle with a .50 caliber mounted
   weapon? Seriously?

   Do you think that [4423]SWAT teams should be deployed to find people
   who steal goods from Wal-Mart?

   Do you think it was reasonable for residents of a town in Arkansas to
   [4424]push back against their police department's plan to deploy cops
   with AR-15s on routine patrols?

   Are you aware that all of this comes at a time when crime is
   [4425]actually falling in the United States?

   Look, I don't want any police officers harmed in the line of duty, but
   the fact is, police departments around the USA are more and more
   resembling military organizations, and I think this gives civilians
   cause for alarm, as deadly force is so commonly deployed these days for
   the slightest of crimes. You can even get [4426]Tased to death now

   communities will not give them blank checks to do as they will, with no

   communities.

   This is not about putting the safety of the police at risk; this is
   about protecting the safety of civilians.

 Ever hear of meth? ([4430]0+ / 0-)
       I have to say, I stopped reading when you asked what small towns
       would need.   Because now we know that it's not about surpressing
       populations, and I'm thinking that there may be a whole bunch of
       reasons out there.
       And we both know that not having armored vehicles wont' save a
       graffiti artist.   You throw that in to make sure that everyone
       knows that you think the cops, as a class, should suffer a bit
       more.  I don't.

       are increasingly deploying potentially lethal force against unarmed
       suspects. That is just one example. This willingness to deploy such
       force is inextricably tied to the availability of tools used to
       deploy such force. Tasers are one of those tools that are widely
       abused by the police. Seriously, just read [4436]Hullabaloo if you
       want regular examples. Read [4437]Latour if you would like a more
       theoretical discussion of the power of objects to behave as actants
       modifying human actions.
       I have heard of meth; I am intrigued to learn more about how small
       town police departments are deploying these tools to combat meth
       production. I'm all ears and anxiously await your examples of why
       these tools are necessary to combat meth.
       Of course, I am of the mind that the whole War on Drugs as it is
       currently waged has been a disaster. But I would still be
       interested to hear how small towns use armored cars and .50 caliber
       weapons to combat meth. Enlighten us.

       No.

     I'm all ears and anxiously await your examples of why these tools
     are necessary to combat meth.
       See, here's your problem: you demand a showing of "necessity", and
       the safety of officers in performing their sworn duties doesn't
       rise to "necessity".
       So let's recap: For you, the possibility of "militarization" is so
       imminent and harmful that there has to be a showing of "necessity"
       for police before they get big guns that are freely available on
       the internet (in a completely non militarized way, of course).
       I don't think that you've proven a harm from "militarization" that
       requires some high standard.

       No, the problem is that you can't actually show a need for this
       equipment and instead keep claiming that it's important based on
       what is frankly racist drug war rhetoric. I'm not saying you're
       racist, but the rhetoric is. The reason we have this militarism is
       racism. It's the southern strategy writ small. The scary brown and
       black drug dealers with guns are killing the good police officers.
       It's the same racism that got us the unconstitutional Stop and
       Frisk. It's pretending that there is some sort of overwhelming risk
       to police officers when there is not.

       Honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about here. If you
       think that armored cars are "freely available on the Internet",
       then I don't even know what to say. We're talking about all sorts
       of military equipment, not just guns.
       My best read on your comment is that the police shouldn't have to
       prove that military grade weapons and armored vehicles are
       necessary for their work; they should just have them. The police
       say jump, and Inland's response is always "how high?"
       What can I say to that? We have a fundamental difference in
       worldview. I believe that the local police need to be managed like
       an organization that provides a public service and not like an
       occupying army. I think that civilians should not be treated by the
       police as enemies.
       All I can say is that I am glad that your position on this remains
       a minority position. Plenty of communities have pushed back against
       the militarization of their local police. And I'm also glad that
       your position is in the minority at Daily Kos -- just witness the
       discussion about stop and frisk here in recent days (which is
       completely related to this issue). People here do not generally
       support giving the police free rein to do whatever the hell they
       want with us and treat us like enemies. Thanks goodness.

       police have to be before you will graciously allow that they are

   afraid. It is particularly troubling in that the new domestic army's
   primary focus is on attacking drug users and progressives.

   This is due of course to the agencies' predilections to side with the
   right wingers or a least the conservative side of politics.

   There are many reasons for this; one is that folks with those
   predilections are most drawn to these fields. Another is that there is
   "institutional memory" about the commies as the major enemy and that
   progressives and drug users are wrapped up in this. One more of course
   is that the various agencies can line their pockets by confiscating
   assets from drug users.

     "It's really about a lack of imagination and a lack of creativity,"
     says Norm Stamper, a retired cop who served as police chief of
     Seattle from 1994 to 2000. "When your answer to every problem is
     more force, it shows that you haven't been taught and trained to
     consider other options."

   I was in downtown San Jose, CA on Tuesday of this week when a seemingly
   disturbed individual started to march fully clothed through a water
   fountain, screaming unintelligibly about "equal rights for all people".
   A crowd gathered and soon the police arrived in force, at least 8 cars
   and about 15 or so officers.

   That could easily be the paragraph that would be followed by a video
   link to one of the horrible incidents we've become all too familiar
   with. What transpired was an example of well trained officers carrying
   out their work in a professional manner.  They surrounded the fountain
   and kept bystanders at a safe distance. Spoke calmly to the individual
   but didnt approach. One officer even sat down and relaxed on a bench
   next to the fountain in a way that made you want to go sit next to him
   and strike up a conversation. In short, they assessed that there was no
   real threat to the public or to the individual and simply stood down.
   After about 20 minutes most of the officers peeled away. A few others
   lingered while the guy continued his tirade. But as the police
   displayed a lack of interest in him, he quieted down, the crowd drifted
   off with a "nothing to see here" nonchalance, and it pretty much turned
   into just a guy acting nutty in the fountain. I couldnt have admired
   the police more for their restraint and intelligence. It may have
   helped that this was public property and they didnt have a mall owner
   or someone insisting that they dude be hauled away. Basically they did
   everything they could have to keep the public and the "perpetrator"
   safe and ultimately the situation resolved itself.

   for speaking out!  This arming of civilian police departments as
   quasi-military units is bizarre and frightening.  I have hated the very
   concept of a "Homeland Security Department" since Dubya established it.
    Something is terribly wrong that our own government is arming civilian
   police as though they're part of the military.  There is only ONE set
   of people who this can possibly be aimed at and it is US. The words of
   this Marine colonel should not be taken lightly or dismissed.  He has
   seen and "lived" war and has the experience to prove it.  That he spoke
   the words he did is an ominous warning that needs to be heeded across
   this country.  I live in WI and I would really NOT want to see the
   Walker junta having access to the equipment and vehicles of a
   quasi-military police force.  Ever.

   unwise, improper, and leads to abuse.

   However, we have to be aware of an undertone in some of the rhetoric.

   about Chris Hedges, but he suggests that what we are seeing in Egypt
   may very well happen here, and Im beginning to believe in that
   possibility...most of it has to do with a growing population and a
   dwindling supply of global resources as well as climate change effects
   besides the usual political power struggles. Wouldn't it make more
   sense to try and avoid those catastrophes? Instead we will arm
   ourselves to the teeth to assure our own destruction?? If that's not
   something out of a dystopian novel I don't know what is...

     "What is happening in Egypt is a precursor to a wider global war
     between the world's elites and the world's poor, a war caused by
     diminishing resources, chronic unemployment and underemployment,
     declining crop yields caused by climate change, overpopulation and
     rising food prices." - Chris Hedges

 A domestic army has been in place in NYC for years ([4888]3+ / 0-)

   Until very recently, I lived in New York City --  both uptown and
   downtown -- for a total of 30 years. Cameras, police, helicopters,
   plainclothes policemen, small jets, etc.  You can tell how juicy the
   overtime is at any particular protest event by the status and level of
   the police officers standing around. OWS padded out their retirements
   very nicely.

   Sometime after September 11, I watched a total of 45 police cars (I
   counted them) in the middle of the afternoon outside, the Metropolitan
   Opera at Lincoln Center, executing some sort of crazy exercise. When
   the cars finally parked I approached one of them and innocently asked
   an officer sitting in the passenger seat, reading the NY Post, if there
   was a problem and should I be concerned for my safety. He responded
   that no there wasn't a problem and they were just doing these things to
   keep people like me safe. Yes, I felt so much safer watching 45 police
   cars speeding up and down the street in choreographed maneuvers.

   A year ago, I left NYC and I no longer experience the tension from the
   constant surveillance, which is a bigger relief than I imagined. To be
   fair, I sometimes intentionally walked into a scene because my number
   one rule is not to be intimidated or afraid of it this type of
   authority, but to step into it and know it.

   The question is: What are we going to do about it? What can we do about
   it. I watched it evolve for over ten years and it is a very serious
   situation.

 We had an officer shot in Philly two days ago ([4898]0+ / 0-)

   [4899]he's awake and responsive, while the suspect is in custody and
   has not been linked with another murder.  [4900]There have been 14
   officers killed in the line of duty since 2000.

   Diaries like this one (and of course, those who play the "we're turning
   into a police state" game) miss as to why the police seek more and
   better weaponry--there is a culture of violence in many of our cities
   and many officers have developed a siege mentality.  Yes, they
   overreact sometimes and often seem too trigger happy.  But put
   yourselves in their shoes.

   Take an hour when you can and watch this:

   The police are part of the cycle of violence, drugs, guns, poverty,

   get some cash from the feds to give themselves an edge in this cycle,
   of course they'll take it.

       those shootings? Just because officers were shot doesn't mean that
       more weaponry and military gear would have helped. All they're
       doing is further removing themselves from the communities they are
       suppose to be protecting.

     Yes, they overreact sometimes and often seem too trigger happy.
       They do, and the more and more powerful the weaponry they have the
       more the public is harmed when they overreact. Excusing it as
       understandable doesn't mean that they need more weapons. Blaming it
       on a "culture of violence" and not the people who are actually
       doing the damage is absurd. The police and the government has
       cultivated a culture of fear that reaches back to the Southern
       Strategy and this militarization is part of that.

       that into account and I've made arguments in the past to support
       the need for more protection for police officers, but this is way
       over the line. They don't need tanks and armoured vehicles... or
       drones. And whose fault is it anyway that we've allowed for such a
       violent gun culture? Our legislators are afraid to do anything
       about the increased violence lest they not be reelected, and
       citizens think they have some god given right to own weapons and
       stand their ground and shoot people indiscriminately.
       No, I don't think this is just a matter of needing more protection.

 This has been going on ([4958]0+ / 0-)

   ...for years. About 10 years ago, I was living in a small rural town in
   central Arizona. I was getting ready for bed one night, when I heard an
   explosion. I thought the oven had blown up or something. I ran back
   toward the living room - right into a masked man, wearing full body
   armor, and carrying an assault rifle. Next thing I know, I'm face down
   on the floor with this guy's knee in my back, being cuffed up.

   As the shock wore off, I must have counted 30 guys, all armed and
   dressed like the first, tearing up my house and milling around the
   front yard. I ended up doing 2 1/2 years for $40.00 worth of grass.

   As they put me in the squad car, I recognized one of the officers, even
   behind the mask. Years earlier, we had been co-workers. So I asked him,
   "Dude, what the hell? You know me. You know I don't own any weapons.
   Why such a large hammer to swat a fly?"  He looked around, then
   whispered, "Overtime."

   Much later, I found out that the town had just been given a federal
   grant, with which they bought the military gear. They couldn't wait to
   play with their new toys, so I was used as a "training aid".

 Unnecessary in Concord ([4973]0+ / 0-)

   As a resident of Concord, NH, I find the request for "armored vehicles"
   to be a bit questionable. The only time we ever had a major problem
   where this may have been somewhat helpful was back when that "tax
   evader" holed up in his property for months on end. He fired on police
   whenever they approached. But even in that situation, the State Police
   and the Feds had a long time to approach this and could truck in
   whatever they needed from the Federal Government if needed.

   Concord is not a very big city. We need more police presence than we
   need more SWAT gear and armored vehicles. The whole Homeland Security
   effort to set up our towns as armed camps "in case" of a terrorist
   attack is ludicrous. Preventing another attack is more important than
   having police with riot gear and armored vehicles afterwards. Spend
   more time and money on hiring more police, more investigators and more
   training for police on how to use what they already have to detect
   suspicious persons and rely that up to the proper authorities. We don't
   need our local police going Rambo.

   the philosophy regarding nuclear weapons was "use them or lose them."
   Today we have the same same philosophy regarding domestic terrorism.
   Just because there aren't as many nuclear weapons doesn't mean that the
   American people aren't threatened by mass destruction. Except the
   threat comes from our own local law enforcement agencies.

   The use of overwhelming force in total war is a hallmark of military
   strategy and tactics, however, that overwhelming force is now being
   used for what used to be called domestic disturbances. The use of SWAT
   teams and armored vehicles during a domestic violence incident can only
   be termed overkill. Domestic violence is a problem but we should be
   attacking the root cause, joblessness, mental illness, instead we
   attack the symptom, using overwhelming force in a military like
   operation. Also the use of these tactics against non violent drug
   offenses is a travesty.
