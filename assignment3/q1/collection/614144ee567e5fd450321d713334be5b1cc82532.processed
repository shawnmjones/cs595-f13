   Godfatherd

   Those of us who dwell in third-world America are well aware of the
   other, dreamy version our our nation. There's no fence to keep us out,
   usually. The barriers are more subtle. We drive through rich America
   all the time, past the glass-wrapped towering skyscrapers, alongside
   the well-manicured golf courses snaking between million dollar homes.
   We see the dozen or so luxury cars waiting in their reserved premium
   spots next to the front door in the giant office parking lot, in front
   of a rag tag collection of bicycles for those healthy enough and close
   enough to commute by manual labor in the summer heat, all framed by
   rows and rows of 10-year-old compact SUVs and aging economy models
   stewing in the sun.

   The affluent now fully enjoy that rarest of Goldilocks conditions,
   you'd think they might be thankful to us: Our relative poverty keeps a
   lid on inflation holding down interest rates at record lows, our flat
   wages keep the stock market propped up near record highs and pump their
   brokerage accounts and 401-K's full with ever more dough. But they're
   not thankful, in fact there's a whole ideology dedicated to telling
   them they not only want more, but deserve it all.

   Thanks to [29]GJohnsit's diary, here's a quick peek at how the well off
   are doing:

     [30]Sun Sentinel -- Sales of mega yachts are turning the corner in
     the improving economy, according to some South Florida-based yacht
     sellers and builders. So far this year, there's been a notable
     upswing in interest for new custom-built yachts of 80 feet or more
     in length and less price slashing on pre-owned boats of this
     caliber, industry specialists say.

     [31]Bloomberg -- The ultimate golf vacation is available for
     $74,450, though there's a wait on the first tee. The 2014 trip
     departs from Maui, tees off in Fiji and ends 22 days later at
     Valderrama Golf Club in Sotogrande, Spain. Covering five continents,
     it includes 12 rounds and transportation on a customized Boeing 757
     jet. Kalos Golf, a luxury golf cruise specialist, sold out the 78
     slots and has a 21-person waiting list. It's an example of growing
     demand for ultraluxury travel amid rising numbers of wealthy people.

   Then there's millions like me. My subset of the working poor is a newer
   group, or at least a growing one, the middle-aged white-collar college
   educated working poor. Basically the idea is bleed us for every cent
   possible, and when we become expensive and try to cash in on insurance
   or other programs we've been paying into for decades, let us die. We
   don't own anything of value left to sacrifice to Mammon, except for one
   last big score assisted by mother nature, bad luck, and some hit men in
   Congress wearing suits. Below is an illustration of how that might work
   in one case, mine. Nothing personal of course.

   Most of us aren't a good prospect for 80' yachts and dream
   round-the-world golf vacations. But there are ways for us to spend
   money too! [32]Like this:

     When the tires on their Dodge Caravan had worn so thin that the
     steel belts were showing through, Don and Florence Cherry couldn't
     afford to buy a new set. So they decided to rent instead.The Rich
     Square, N.C., couple last September agreed to pay Rent-N-Roll $54.60
     a month for 18 months in exchange for four basic Hankook tires. Over
     the life of the deal, that works out to $982, almost triple what the
     radials would have cost at Wal-Mart.
     "I know you have to pay a lot more this way," said Florence Cherry,
     a 57-year-old nurse who drives the 15-year-old van when her husband,
     a Vietnam veteran, isn't using it to get to his job as a prison
     guard. "But we didn't really have a choice."

   I'm in that group, now, it's not that we want to pay three or four
   times what stuff costs, it's that we have no choice. It gets worse than
   that. A few months ago I suffered a [33]major heart attack, got a
   stent, lost 40 lbs, quit smoking, cut my cholesterol in half--I simply
   do not eat much and when I do it's all damn healthy stuff--and I did
   all that on disability pay based on 60 percent of 12 bucks an hour and
   reader contributions while my medical expenses exploded, leaving me
   near destitute. As luck would have it, I'm not done.

   It seems a PFO has developed--a hole between the two main chambers of
   the heart--and, good news, it's a highly treatable complication. Except
   it means taking more time off from my low-paying job, many weeks as it
   has to crank through the managed care system, and more poverty level
   disability while I get it diagnosed and repaired. That's if the
   disability gets approved. If it doesn't I'll probably be fired for
   missing too much work, leaving me dead broke, bereft of life saving
   meds, and harboring a potentially deadly complication with no way to
   fix it.

   The last time I had weird symptoms it was that heart attack that could
   have easily killed me. This time I was a smart about it, taking time
   off from work--without pay--as soon as the symptoms became noticeable
   and aggressively pushing the cardiologist for an answer. But there's a
   real good chance the insurance company will come back and tell me,
   "Even though you had no way to know what was going on at the time, and
   good reason to be worried, in retrospect that condition isn't always
   immediately life threatening so we're not going to approve any
   disability." At which point I will be fired for missing that time and
   I'll lose my health insurance altogether, then try to afford COBRA
   premiums on Texas grade unemployment payment. Which would leave me with
   the "freedom" to choose between the meds that keep the PFO in check or
   having a roof over my head.

   There's not much light at the end of the tunnel, either.

   people looking for work. Click image for full article at Wonkblog.

   Of course if you ask the fat and happy Austerians or their "small
   government" enablers in the congressional and media axis of evil, those
   pragmatic deficit hawks--almost all of whom are on the high end of the
   government dole or benefit from same, and who enjoyed or are still
   enjoying that sweet socialized medicine courtesy of John Q
   Taxpayer--will smugly say millions like me, in the struggling America,
   need to sacrifice more. Does it matter that we we don't have much left
   to sacrifice? That the margin is so thin for me and I'm sure for many
   in comments below to come, sacrifice at this point would mean giving up
   important things, like a meal a day or life saving meds? That's the
   reality. There's simply no significant luxuries and little in the way
   of optional basic necessities left to cut out of our bare-bone budgets.

   When I point out to my conservative friends that the GOP really and
   truly has no plan to help people like me, that expecting us to be
   willing to die so that David Koch has an extra hundred million is
   unrealistic to put it mildly, they can't seem to process it. Usually
   they try to steer the debate back to some version of the shame tactic,
   i.e., "expecting the government to take care" of you.

   Yes, simply because the middle-aged working poor paid in a couple
   hundred thousand dollars to a system since age 14 with the
   understanding it would be there for us no matter what if and when we
   need it, I'm the mooch. Some of us might even become permanently
   disabled before we reach officially sanctioned retirement age and
   really drag on the system! But in my case that tired cliche doesn't
   apply at all: The critical short-term disability that will barely keep
   me in Ramen and bean soup while I recover is a private policy between
   me and CIGNA, which includes additional short-term disability I signed
   up for and paid extra premiums to get. In other words, Mr. and Mrs.
   RedState, I was financially responsible for myself--not an easy task on
   12 bucks an hour let me tell you!

   This suspected PFO is not the worst thing a heart patient can get, far
   from it! It's easy to fix, as long as you have a spare 20 grand or
   comprehensive medical insurance, recovery is usually complete and
   virtually guaranteed. There are plenty of other things that leave
   workers in that gray area between bedridden and terminal, and treatable
   but unable to consistently work 50 hours a week for awhile. All kinds
   of cardio-pulmonary issues, cancers, orthopedic injuries, complications
   from diabetes, etc., fall under this category. What is the GOP plan for
   those folks?

   We know the real answer, Alan Grayson said it on the House floor in
   2009 and the conservative base applauded wildly when candidates
   repeated it during the GOP clown show last year: It would really be
   easier for the Paul Ryan's and David Koch's of the world if a whole
   bunch of us would just die, quickly, without any protracted final days
   in ICU. Yes, die, as soon as possible--unless we can be forced back to
   work and pump up their precious corporate earnings and highly coveted
   Social Security trust fund even more before finally, conveniently,
   keeling over on the job.

   Ah, but one asset millions of us do still have, we're fully insured on
   Social Security and Medicare, having paid in for decades at a living
   wage when times were better. That adds up to a shitload of money, which
   is why the Austerians with the help of their conservative hitmen are
   hell bent on stealing that from us, too. Having most of it isn't enough
   for the super rich, they want it all, every last fucking cent.

   Nothing personal, Sonny. It's just business.

   commas.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   who own huge yachts are not Republicans. Some are liberal Democrats who
   just happen to be rich. The problem is really with just the subset of
   rich people who prioritize their tax rates over the good of the
   country. A surprising number of rich people do not like what is
   happening and would prefer to pay more in taxes in order to balance the
   scales. They give a lot of money to Obama and other Dems and good
   progressive causes, but they can't control a GOP Congress. Every
   $25,000-a-plate fundraiser that Obama goes to (and he goes to a lot) is
   full of people telling him that they want to pay higher taxes.

   rail against the evils of the wealthy (and for very good reason, I do
   to), because the rich just don't want to pay more taxes to the Govt to
   "pay for" all the things that are necessary for the Govt to do to help
   us make a better society.  But thats the rub, the wealthy have
   perpetuated The Big Lie since Nixon and his commerce secretary Pete
   Peterson (yes, that pete peterson of Fix the Debt fame),  took the USA
   off the gold standard on August 15, 1971.  The Big Lie is that the Govt
   must get tax money or borrow before it can spend money just like our
   personal household or business budgets.  The USA runs a fiat monetary
   system and uses a non-convertible, floating exchange rate national
   currency.  The US dollar comes from the US govt.  If you think that the
   Govt can't "afford" to pay for SS or medicare for all unless it first
   raises the taxes on the wealthy, then you are part of the problem.
   Americans will never ever accept tax collections as high as 30 - 40% of
   GDP to "pay for" a social democracy with a better safety net, and they
   don't have to.  The federal Govt has no need of our money, it does not
   work in any way like a regular budget.  The Govt is the currency issuer
   and we don't need to tie new social spending to higher taxes, that
   argument is a political loser and the reason for The Big Lie in the
   first place.  As long as people believe that the Federal Govt must
   "earn money" instead of simply create more of its own money (like it
   does for every deficit dollar), than the rich right wingers are going
   to keep winning.

   Can you assure that " Democrats who just happen to be rich" pay taxes

   I am reminded that in the discussion of the Mittster's tax obligations
   it was pointed out that there are legal provisions for donating more
   than one's tax obligation to the US.  Of  course I am also conscious of
   the revelation (for me, at least) in the book "Perfectly Legal" that
   Bill Gates made a profit on his massive donation to his foundation,

 Also the lower middle class is now poor ([639]20+ / 0-)

   So yes there are some super rich people that are consuming the major
   amount of resources and through policies causing massive redirection of
   income.  On the other hand, over the past twenty years all the
   affordable housing in my area has been destroyed.  The poor are forced
   to move the segregated areas within the cities, where resources are not
   available, or the suburbs where is it much harder to be poor.  Most of
   the free cultural and educational opportunities  have disappeared, and
   those that are left have become so scarce to be unavailable to most.

   In the city with affordable housing it is not impossible to be lower
   middle class.  We had a car, but it never had to go more than five
   miles to get everywhere we needed to go.  I could walk or ride my bike
   or the bus everywhere, even if meant I sometimes had to walk a few
   miles.  I never needed to have much money in my pocket.  I never needed
   a car until I had a job that support a monthly payment.

   My concern with kids today is that they lack free opportunities to do
   stuff.  They lack safety outside.  On my street SUVs are parked all
   over the road so no one can see, and SUVs drive at great speed down the
   narrow roads with no care of who they are going to hit, polluting the
   air.  Kids are told they need junk food and cell phones and video games
   to be happy.  Where are their opportunities to just go outside and
   experience the world, take a bus downtown, walk to a library.  To me it
   is not so much that the middle class is necessarily shrinking, but it
   that the expectations are increasing so much, and the things that used
   to funded by taxes are now pay for play, that those of us who would one
   be considered lower middle class are now poor.

   Jobs that once had insurance do not.  Jobs that once had paid sick days
   do not.  Free vaccinations are no more.  Even parks are becoming
   private clubs.

   Man, can you believe it?

   I was out jogging in the park, feeling good about myself.
   It was a beautiful day. Sun was up.  People running the other way
   smiled and said "Hello!"

   When I was done with my run, I ambled over to the juice bar to score me
   a smoothie, when, suddenly, somebody leapt up to open the door.

   As I entered the place, 4 employees threw themselves on the floor and
   insisted that I walk to the counter over their prostrate bodies so as
   to avoid indignities to the soles of my shoes.

   Guy at the counter had my smoothie made before I even got there, and
   served it to me with his head bowed, refusing to make eye contact.

   I went back to my car, and, to my surprise, my trusty and rusty old Geo
   Prizm was gone, replaced by a Tungsten Silver Aston Martin DB9.

   Whaddya know?

   Somewhere between mile 2 and the juice bar, I had become filthy
   stinking rich.

   Go figure.

   another one. The contract just completed is for a yuppie doctor. We
   still have to pick up our stuff and I still have to get the second half
   of the contracted price.

   He has gone off on us twice already. Each time afterwards he's quiet
   for a day or two. Last time he just kept going on and on and on.
   Telling us what shit work we do and how there is no pride of
   craftsmanship any more. Just laying it on, real thick. We are widely
   acknowledged to be the best in Boulder at what we do. I don't charge a
   lot for quality, just what we cost and a small profit. I mean we are
   all in poverty or close to it, I don't think we're overcharging.

   He was way ticked off at why we didn't do something a certain way. No
   one does. Never have. I've been doing this specialty type construction
   for 16 years, know most people in the business. Guy just wouldn't shut
   up about something he knew nothing about. ER doctor.

   Me, I dont' get excited, I dont' raise my voice, I don't cuss. I really
   wonder what he's going to pull. The second half is not only the cost of
   all the labor and profit but probably some of the materials. I pay well
   for the industry. Often his type they figure if they can't find some
   stuff for you to change or fix at the end they aren't getting their
   money's worth.

   Just some entitled yuppie doc who is used to being an asshole. Every
   day in the 90s, lotta rocks, jack hammer type digging for 4 days is on
   the menu, happier digging rocks than dealing with the entitled.

   an auto accident and an autoimmune disease making me unemployable in my
   twenties.

   Currently I am using my skills as a "good plain cook", organizer, and
   endless patience with the elderly to take care of my father-in-law part
   of the time. But no one is employable who has to take a two-hour nap
   every afternoon and can't stand for more than ten minutes at a time.

   Oh, and I tripped over his oxygen line and re-sprained the worse of the
   two bad ankles. No, I haven't been to the doctor. Not like they'll do
   anything. What I need done involves an orthopedic surgeon and a lot of
   money.

   When you come to find how essential the comfort of a well-kept home is
   to the bodily strength and good conditions, to a sound mind and spirit,
   and useful days, you will reverence the good housekeeper as I do above

   yes, the government is behaving abominably whenever it can, and in the
   pockets of the 1%, and corrupt, and all that. But mostly they do not
   pay a great deal of attention to acts of defiance, especially ones that
   do not break either windows or heads -- for better or worse. Occupy
   Wall St. got a lot of police attention; Occupy elsewhere varied a lot.
   There is actually quite a bit of space for protests, especially
   nonviolent and creative ones, and the more we use it, the more that
   space will grow. (Overpass Light Brigade, I'm looking at you. . . .)
   And most people are far more likely to get arrested for disturbing the
   peace, and charges then dropped once the demonstration has ended, than
   to be charged under the Patriot Act.

   All of which is to say, do it anyway. Find a group, find some friends,
   figure out a creative place and time and manner, and say what you need
   to say. It's the only hope we have.

   Living-wage jobs have been disappearing from the economy for a long
   time, decades. We've become acclimated, like the froggie in the
   lukewarm water, where the temperature gradually increases to boiling.

   I snicker when I hear people describe this downturn as a "crisis." It's
   an end-point, one the oligarchs have worked to create, no "crisis" to
   them. Glenn Beck, at the height of his career, did a segment to instill
   "the dignity of poverty" (with footage from the Great Depression) in
   viewers. At the end, he credited the Kochs for funding.

   Generally the Pollyanna, I don't see an end in sight to this one,
   unfortunately.

   God help us all.

   The capitalists are digging in for a major fight (e.g., Koch suckers

   But time is against them, both because of the generational change and
   because (as Nouriel Roubini pointed out), the system will rip itself
   apart from its own internal contradictions.

   only mine turned to the question of "why did I wake up from that
   medically induced coma?"  I suffered full cardiac arrest thanks to our
   wonderful medical system and struggle to keep my business going, having
   blown through my life savings, struggle to keep my house of 27 years,
   knowing everything I built is gone while others enjoy a lavish
   lifestyle.

   That I beat the odds and lived they would consider a failing in the
   system.  You are indeed correct, they want it all from us and, as Alan
   Grayson said, they want us to hurry up and die.

     Basically the idea is bleed us for every cent possible, and when we
     become expensive and try to cash in on insurance or other programs
     we've been paying into for decades, let us die.

    Whether through dumping hard work and long hours on weakened people,
   or denial of medical care, or just a general wearing down of our
   spirit, there's an element of deliberation in their actions.

   I am paying $5K out of my own pocket (withdrawn from an account I've
   been contributing to for years now and constituting most of my savings)
   for medical work in a few days.

   Yes, insurance kicked in $1K, but $600 of that $1K went to office
   visits, xrays, etc.

   And we've been furloughed at my job, meaning a substantial cut in my
   paycheck at the same time.

   I'm just thankful I haven't encountered an emergency---but I have

       over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary, if you thought that

       Republican candidate?
       Not to be harsh, but that's where the rubber meets the road. I say
       the risk is worth the chance of a better future, rather than the
       less worse (but still worse) future we're getting.
       And then there's the latent power of FDR-style "I welcome their

       pick up. While they don't, the danger of right-wing populism brews.

   warehouse, and she was taken by her employer to a local clinic.  She
   was not allowed to take off work.  They suddenly increased her hours
   from 28 to 36 per week.  Another employee had the same accident on the
   same carpet, got the same increase in weekly hours.
   Neither employee had requested more hours, and both are long time

       has more to do with avoiding a law suit and the only way to "fix"
       the problem was to get the employees on the insurance roll.  I see
       a future, once on the mend, they end up either back in their old
       slot or, more likely, terminated.  Once the liability is
       discharged, discharge the evidence.
       Call me cynical, but it happened to me once upon a time.  I cost my
       employer  his annual kickback for a no claim year.  The boss said,
       "I was accident prone!" BTW: construction job related and minor, I
       took 2 stitches on the top of my head.  I would have done it myself
       but I couldn't see the laceration.

   I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my
   daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom but I taught her
   never to dishonor her family. She found a "boy friend," not an Italian.
   She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late. I didn't protest.
   Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. They
   made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her.
   She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her. Like an animal.
   When I went to the hospital her nose was broken. Her jaw was shattered,
   held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain. But
   I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life. A beautiful girl.
   Now she will never be beautiful again.

   Sorry...

   I went to the police, like a good American. These two boys were brought
   to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and
   suspended the sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very
   day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those two bastards, they
   smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, "For justice, we must go to Don
   Corleone."

   Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

   What do you want of me? Tell me anything. But do what I beg you to do.

   What is that?

   That I cannot do.

   I will give you anything you ask!

   We have known each other many years, but this is the first time you've
   come to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time you
   invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is
   godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted
   my friendship. And you feared to be in my debt.

   I didn't want to get into trouble.

   I understand. You found paradise in America. You had a good trade, you
   made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of
   law. So you didn't need a friend like me. Now you come and say "Don
   Corleone, give me justice." But you don't ask with respect. You don't
   offer friendship. You don't even think to call me "Godfather." You come
   into my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to
   do murder - for money.

   I ask you for justice.

   That is not justice. Your daughter is alive.

   Let them suffer then as she suffers.

   How much shall I pay you?

   Bonasera, Bonasera, what have I ever done to make you treat me so
   disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, this scum who
   ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by some
   chance an honest man like yourself made enemies they would become my
   enemies. And then, they would fear you.

   Be my friend... Godfather.

   Good.

   Some day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a
   service for me. But until that day, consider this justice a gift on my
   daughter's wedding day.

   Give this job to Clemenza. I want reliable people, people who aren't
   going to be carried away. I mean, we're not murderers, in spite of what
   this undertaker thinks...

   unit for a spell of heartbeat skips that several interns suspected in
   the ER were almost certainly benign, as they proved to be after a
   couple days of tests. We figured my most important symptom was my
   excellent state employee health insurance.

   It's very sobering to be lying there hooked up to a monitor whose alarm
   goes off a couple times a minute when you aren't sure what your
   situation is.

   Congratulations on getting your cholesterol down and I hope you're able
   to get patched up.

   Now my insurance is state worker retiree and we're just marking time
   till they downgrade it to either catastrophic-only, or maybe worse,
   like dental insurance that covers only the routine preventative
   checkups and nothing that really matters.

   Millions of Americans could or should I say, can write the same thing
   you have.

   Another item of real note is the fact that we are talking millions
   here. Not some piddlin' amount. But hey, after a while, "millions" just
   doesn't carry the weight it should when conversing.

   No money left. Everybody wants a piece of my aging carcass these days.
   The anger builds by the month. After being subjected to the attacks, it
   is flight or fight.

   Keep on keeping on. Sooner or later the people will have a belly full
   and decide they are not going to run away any longer. It's overwhelming
   here in the trenches to say the least, and my belief is that the the 1%
   have no clue what we deal with on a daily basis.

       of the tricks going on these days, and it includes higher level

       several centers. But no raise. When they asked they were told to
       think about how this would look great on their resume and help

     A few months ago I suffered a major heart attack, got a stent, lost
     40 lbs, quit smoking, cut my cholesterol in half--

   Cigarettes may be legal, but they are destructive as any illegal
   narcotic. They destroy your health. Smoking is one of the top risk
   factors for heart disease. We've known this for decades now.

   To have high cholesterol, be overweight, and smoke cigarettes? You
   could have just bought a gun and played Russian Roulette.

   I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for saying that, but abstaining from
   self-destructive behavior costs no money.

   Sorry, but I don't buy this -- it's just one more way that the elite
   get us to fight amongst ourselves instead of focusing on the real
   problem, which is them.

   Yes, cigarettes are destructive.  Yes, everyone should know that
   smoking is bad for you.

   But I'd like to find anyone out there who hasn't at some point engaged
   in potentially destructive behavior.  Most of us have, and if we're
   lucky we end up escaping the worst consequences of that behavior.

   In any event, I'll note that a personal attack on the diarist in this
   regard seems unrelated to the point of the diary.

   For American mobsters, that means killing a few score disloyal

   For American austerians, that means killing hundreds of thousands a
   year, primarily via lack of decent affordable health care that every
   other civilized country provides.

   Wingnut governors like Scott Walker and Rick Perry who are proud to be
   cutting Medicaid are kiilling people as sure as if they'd put a bullet
   in their heads.

   But they get away with it, because it's legal to kill poor sick people
   by denying them basic health care.

   And in some states governed by sociopaths, killing poor sick people is
   shamefully popular.

   A public option for health insurance is a national priority.

   I believe that a semi-conscious decision was made to wreck this country
   when it became apparent that the US wasn't going to 1) roll back civil
   rights, 2) put women back in their place, 3) nuke North Vietnam. The
   conservative movement, at the time a right wing fringe, decided in the
   early 80s to take no prisoners right as the Dems were moving towards
   triangulation. Now the far right conservatives set the agenda and the
   centrist Dems have no spine for a fight. At all. (yeah that means Obama
   and Clinton and Reid. Pelosi seems (seemed) ready to fight)

   Until what's left of the old liberal coalition starts using the
   rhetoric of total war it's basically a race to the bottom. Deng knew he
   could destroy the US labor market and Reagan / Bush / Clinton sold us
   out for corporate contributions. (I'm sure Clinton didn't / doesn't see
   it that way but the history is stark)

   We need a national leader to say "enough!" and start the fight for
   2014. Not sure who besides Warren and I don't think she wants that job
   right now.

       From 2006 through 2008, this blog battled our own party leadership

       Pelosi/Reid continuously capitulating to Bush over the timelines
       for withdrawal, the surge, taking impeachment off the table,
       retroactive telecom immunity, the Military Commissions Act of 2006,
       torture, extraordinary rendition, Abu Ghraib, renewal of the
       Patriot Act, the Protect America Act, the John Warner 2007 National

   That's what you're describing, and I don't think it's some random
   byproduct of the global economy --  I think it's a conscious part of
   their collective plan, and that at least in the star chambers of the
   elite of the elite they talk about it in glowing tones: reduce the
   quality of living for the masses, cut the number of jobs as a whole,
   cut the availability of health care

   and wait for the poor to die.

   It's much less messy, in our wired world, than trying to use Uncle
   Adolph's crude but effective 20th century methods, but it must be

   about all of this greed and avarice is that most of us don't even want
   or expect that much; a decent place to live, food on the table, a car
   that runs and time to watch the kids play baseball, luxuries that 2/3
   of the planet currently can't access because of a cancerous "free
   market" capitalist system subsidized by our tax dollars, a system of
   belief summed up by Sitting Bull, 1877, Powder River Cpnference:

   "Yet hear me, my people, we have now to deal with another race - small
   and feeble when our fathers first met them, but now great and
   overbearing. Strangely enough they have a mind to till the soil and the
   love of possessions is a disease with them . . . They claim this mother
   of ours, the earth, for their own, and fence their neighbours away;
   they deface her with their buildings and their refuse. They threaten to
   take [the land] away from us. My brothers, shall we submit, or shall we
   say to them: "First kill me before you take possession of my
   Fatherland."

       I'm not looking for a corporate jet and a ten million dollar
       retirement account. A tiny piece of property with a one room mobile
       home, reliable healthcare, and an efficient reliable car would do
       fine for me as long as I'm single. Those sound like unreachable
       luxuries at this point.
       I could do that for 50K and the only reasons I want to own the
       property is so I won't get kicked out into the street when I'm too
       old or too sick to work. Plus a payment on that would be about half
       what I'm paying in rent for a studio cracker box now.
       My experience has been you will not qualify for a 50K loan no
       matter what your history when you're middle-aged making 12 bucks an
       hour, not without a well off cosigner or collateral worth way more
       than 50K.

   Rising numbers? Really? More than likely, the 1%'s progeny are just
   getting started spending their inheritances. Because not many middle
   class folks are making it into the one per cent; rather, most are
   backsliding into the lower class. It is also quite likely that the rich
   are simply becoming more bold about spending their wealth
   ostentatiously, having by now secured the Congress and Supreme Court to
   do their bidding. As for the White House, well, given time, that too
   will be theirs.

   Record all your phone calls with your disability and health insurers.
   Having a particular conversation on tape can come in pretty handy when
   they try to jerk you around.

   You can get an inexpensive connecting gizmo at any Radio Shack.
   Depending on your state, you may have to inform them you are taping the
   call.

   I'm pretty sure the reason a lot of folks work for insurance companies
   is because the mafia thought they weren't nice enough.

       there was a court case a while back that said that if they say

   Suffering from colitis severe enough to be terminal, I found out the
   hard way that Ohio State, the place where I was a graduate student, had
   simply deemed me too expensive to live.  That was hammered home most
   efficiently when I tried to negotiate a bigger drug benefit (for more
   premium) with an insurance rep, only to get told quite directly that
   chronically ill students had been "tossed out the lifeboat" in order
   that the undergrads could have a cheap policy.

   The benefit was $1500 worth of drugs a year, after which you paid 100%.

   What saved me was two things: finding out that the Cleveland Clinic,
   one of the premiere digestive disease centers in the world, was in my
   network, and a well-off (but far from wealthy) friend giving me a $3500
   gift so I'd survive the wallet biopsy the Clinic did before they would
   schedule a surgery.

   One full colectomy and J-pouch later, I STILL need a drug that costs
   about $1500 a month to survive, but at least now my disease is in
   remission.  Thanks to one well-off friend.

   How many out there don't have well-off friends, who face such
   abandonment by "the system?"  Too fucking many.  I survived being
   labeled surplus population.  Many do not.  And I'm glad you, too, have
   made it so far, DarkSyde.

 Shifting the Cost to the Taxpayer ([1972]11+ / 0-)

   First, I want to wish you well. I don't know what I could possibly say
   that would make this better for you in any way.

   But second, this is exactly what I mean when I say that the idea of
   cutting government costs is just a way to shift the costs to the
   taxpayers. There's nothing about the Republican plan that actually
   solves the problem. And if you don't solve the problem, then you aren't
   cutting the costs. You're just shifting them to people who can't afford
   to pay them.

   And, third, this is because we have a national policy of keeping wages
   down and exporting wealth-producing jobs. Workers have seen their wages
   go down when they should have gone up. The economy expands and workers
   produce more (productivity is up over 80% since 1980), but that isn't
   reflected in their compensation. And that is why we have a federal
   deficit and a mounting national debt. It's simply because we are
   driving our working population to the poor house.

   We need to turn this around. We need a coherent plan to put progressive
   in office. That starts with the Democratic primaries. If you know a
   progressive who can stand for election next year, this is an ideal time
   to draft them.

   But specifically, when you hear people talk about cutting government
   spending you need to tell them that the problem is wages and
   unemployment. Declining wages and expanding unemployment are
   responsible for the deficit. If they're serious about fixing the
   deficit, they need to get on their lawmakers about those issues.

   Think, liberally.

   My story mirrors the diary a lot , I got sick , was fully invested in

   Any assets you have are all taken for medical and living expense's ,
   then you are treated like crap by medicaid doctors , and there is no
   rental assistance so far , thanks to welfare reform , I only get food
   stamps , now I am partially disabled and have not found a sit down job
   yet

   I basically became a scumbag moocher because I got sick

    I was a sucker at one time , I thought America and Americans were
   pretty great , I had no idea this was going on around me , and I am a
   pretty well informed compassionate liberal

   Can you imagine if we had done H/C reform 20 years ago? How many people
   would be a live still ? A hand full of people screwed over 100's of

   Seems clear enough to me that Republicans don't mind the state of

   (something about natural law or some such nonsense).  But, there are
   many (read it please as not all and no one being blamed in particular)
   Democrats who support neo-liberal policies that are equally
   destructive.
   The bad ideas just keep rolling in from the D side.  Okay I'll be
   specific.  Take Governor Cuomo idea of a "tax free" zone.  Sounds nice
   on the surface but it's the same old re-processed right wing junk.  We
   all know what happens when taxes are not collected - schools close,
   public services are cut, public workers are laid off.  So why do
   Democrats recycle bad Republican ideas?  Both parties have contributed
   to the lop sided nature of our economy.
