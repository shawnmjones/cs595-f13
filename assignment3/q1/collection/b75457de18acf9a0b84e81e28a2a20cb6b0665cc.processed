   Arya Stark, my favorite little sociopath
   Once every season, George R. R. Martin takes up his pen to script an
   episode of the series based on his books. Martin's an extremely
   talented, and very experienced, screenwriter having helmed Beauty and
   the Beast (the good one, not the new one) as well as turning in
   multiple scripts for the revivals of the Twilight Zone and Outer
   Limits. His episodes of A Game of Thrones have always been among the
   meatiest. In the first season, he delivered The Pointy End in which the
   betrayal of Eddard is revealed and Robb starts along the road to war.
   Last year he penned the absolutely marvelous Blackwater, which provided
   the action climax of the season and gave us moments that still act as
   pivot-points for the series. Not only did these scripts move the plot
   miles down field, they also provided some of the best moments for the
   characters and a decided lack of sex and gore for sex and gore's sake.

   This year, Martin's contribution is The Bear and the Maiden Fair. Does
   it live up to the previous offerings?  Uhhh ... nope. In fact, far from
   providing the most action/plot/character building episode of the year,
   what this episode does is kind of paddle in place.

   Come on in, let's hash it out anyway.

   Not so far up north as before they scaled the wall, Jon Snow and the
   wildlings are walking among actual trees.  Ygritte charmingly mistakes
   a windmill for a castle and Jon teases her about the wonders of
   Winterfell. He'd probably be boasting a bit less if he'd been home
   lately. It's Ygritte's turn to laugh when Jon has to explain to her the
   delicate sensibilities of some women, though I'm not sure we seen many
   examples of swoon-ish women in Game of Thrones. Maybe Sansa (poor
   Sansa). Hawk whisperer Orell declares his loves to Ygritte and his hate
   to Jon. Then goes on to plant seeds of doubt in Ygritte's mind about
   Jon Snow's ability to ever really be anything but the straightest of
   straight arrows.

   Next up, Robb Stark takes a rain delay. Literally. Robb and Talisa roll
   around their well-appointed traveling bed while half the Stark company
   complains of the rain and the other half repeat eleventeen variations
   on "Walder Frey is already mad as hell, and he's not going to like us
   being late." Nice as it is to see that Robb and Talisa genuinely care
   for each other, most of the scene accomplishes little but to keep
   Talisa's bare backside maximally exposed for a lengthy period before
   revealing that Robb's new wife has a wolf pup in the oven (ick, sorry
   for the badly mixed metaphor). The scene does remind you that Robb is
   perhaps the nicest guy left on the playing field, but honestly this
   late in the season a lengthy "let's pause here because the roads are
   wet" scene just feels like deliberate stalling.

   And down to King's Landing to see Sansa. Poor future Lady Lannister.
   Sansa sighs over her childhood dreams (from just two seasons ago) in
   which she couldn't wait to see all the beautiful knights and ladies of
   the capital. Surprise! Margaery does a good job of offering a
   comforting shoulder. In fact, Margaery's praise of Tyrion is so
   fullsome it makes you wonder if the queen-to-be wouldn't rather wed a
   different Lannister. And Margaery is right. Tyrion is by far the most
   attractive of the golden horde, mostly because he comes with actual
   motivations beyond "what's in it for me" and combines a sharp mind and
   a tender heart. Though I'm not too sure of Margaery's declaration that
   in marrying Tyrion, Sansa will become the lady of Casterly Rock. Papa
   Tywin has already indicated that Tyrion's chances of getting the
   ancestral home are slim and none. In any case, marry him, Sansa, go off
   to someplace away from the fighting and talk to the man. Loras' curly
   hair isn't everything.

   Meanwhile, husband to be Tyrion is feeling more than a little
   embarrassed, not to say squeamish, about bedding a child (book Sansa is
   still short of her 15th birthday, though TV Sansa is... taller).
   Besides, Tyrion is genuinely in love with the spicy Shae. Convincing
   Shae to stick around while Tyrion marries the little auburn-haired
   beauty isn't going to be easy. And probably shouldn't be. Still, Tyrion
   is putting a big effort into keeping Shae content, even if that does
   mean he puts his foot in his mouth more than once.

   Completing our King's Landing tour, we see Joffery summoning Granpa
   Tywin into the throne room. Having recently given a smack-down to his
   mother (and aunt) Cersei, Joffery is feeling his oats as he demands
   more involvement in running the realm. But, as we've seen several
   times, Tywin suffers no fools. Not gladly. Not at all. Within thirty
   seconds, you can see the boy king wondering just why he ever asked to
   see his Hand. Tywin eventually tells Joffery that he will tell him
   everything that Tywin thinks he needs to know and solicit his advice on
   everything that doesn't matter. In other words, nothing changes. Tywin
   runs the kingdom, Joffery gets to sit on his uncomfortable chair. And
   kill the occasional ex-prostitute.

   We leave King's Landing without every seeing Cersei, which may be a
   first, and without ever getting to see what kind of dialog Martin could
   provide to Dame Diana Hepburn Eleanor Queen of Thorns Rigg, which is a
   shame.

   Cross the ocean, Daenerys pulls up at the next slave city, Yunkai, and
   gives the slave owners of this rather large city the kind of ultimatum
   that's designed to generate a good deal of friction. The Yunkai try to
   buy the mother of dragons off. It doesn't work. So more war is
   a'coming. For those who are waiting for Dany to charge on over to
   Westeros and put Joffery's head on a (dragon-roasted) spit, this
   episode is more than a bit disappointing. Having freed the Unsullied,
   Dany has apparently decided that on her way to the Iron Throne she
   might as well save a city, or two, or... One thing about this scene:
   the dragons look fabulous. I mean, gorgeous in both movement and
   detail. All those little frills and spines. I loves me some beasties.
   It's no wonder everyone wants one. Still, I agree with Jorah -- taking
   this place won't get us any closer to Westeros. Move, girl, move!

   In a brief shipboard interlude, Melisandre informs Gendry of his
   royal-bastardhood as they sail past King's Landing. I suppose we had to
   make this point clear (and for book readers this confirms that Gendry
   has taken on the role formerly held by Sir Not Appearing In This
   Series, Edric Storm), but how did we end up sailing down the
   Blackwater? Weren't we in the Riverlands last week? Is this really the
   fastest route back to Dragonstone? And don't the Lannisters keep at
   least a nominal watch over the river that, not so long ago, an
   attacking navy swarmed down to attack the city? Hmmm.

   Meanwhile, Arya is pissed. Good for Arya. I love Arya. Did you know
   that Arya is trending as one of the most popular names for girls? Just
   wait till those kids are in grade school. Anyway, the Brotherhood
   blames their jerkwad treatment of Gendry on the Red God. Asked who she
   worships, Arya answers simply "death." Did I mention I love Arya? No
   sixth grader on the planet can deliver this line with such patent
   menace. When Arya makes a break for it, she's snatched out of the woods
   by the guy at the top of her hate list, The Hound. See you next week,
   Arya.

   One thing I really did not expect from Martin was a Theon torture
   interval. In the book, all the torture is off screen. But here it is
   again. On screen.  And just as pointless as every other Theon torture
   scene. Moving on.

   Up north again when Bran get's his dreams explained by fellow
   dream-afflicted Jojen. Osha takes this opportunity to tell a scary
   story (actually it is pretty scary) about the wight encounter that got
   her moving south. Which explains a good deal of Osha's concerns about
   how they keep moving north.

   And finally I've saved the back and forth of Jaime and Brienne scenes
   for one end-of-the-recap lump. Having been marched out of the castle
   without his big protector, one-handed Jaime insists that they march
   back by threatening to lie about how he lost his hand. He then
   threatens to lie some more. Which, if I was guarding Jaime, would make
   me think there's a good chance he's going to lie no matter what. But
   they do march back and find Brienne fending off a very (very) big bear
   with a wooden sword. A BIG bear. Jaime rushes to her aid and both
   escape the bear pit just ahead of large slavering jaws. Even so, the
   scene comes off as much shorter and less tense than it did in the book.
   As the centerpiece of the episode, it falls a little flat. However,
   this isn't a CGI bear, and I suppose there are only so many times you
   can wave pointy sticks its way and put tasty actors in its beary grip
   before it gets that "screw the bear chow, I'm having Danish" idea.

   So there you have it. A lot happened, but not many story lines really
   advanced. What's your take?

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [46]Civil
   Rights, [47]Community, [48]Congress, [49]Culture, [50]Economy,
   [51]Education, [52]Elections, [53]Energy, [54]Environment, [55]Health
   Care, [56]International, [57]Labor, [58]Law, [59]Media, [60]Meta,
   [61]National Security, [62]Science, [63]Transportation, or [64]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([65]California, [66]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       of explaining the poverty of Daenery's childhood.  Emotionally
       impoverished.  No mother, only her sadistic brother/tormentor.
       Financially inpoverished, at the mercy of people who would use her
       and abuse her for their own reasons.  Sold herself by those
       supposedly caring for her.  Totally powerless until she discovered
       her power and owned it.  I think Dany is one of the casting
       successes with the series.

       embraces her husband -- she's thirteen at the time -- and his whole

       allows her brother/tormentor to be destroyed.

       But I come from an old New Orleans family that actually still had a
       wad of Confederate money stashed away when I was a kid.  And, sure
       enough, some of the ten-spots (all sorts of banks were issuing
       money, so every denomination came in multiple versions from
       multiple banks) had that "Dix" instead of, or in addition to,
       "Ten", that we get Dixie from.  The Old Confederacy was actually
       part-way bilingual, at least as far as banking was concerned, at
       least until it lost all those francophone bankers when Farragut
       took New Orleans in 1862.
       That would be one clear difference between that Confederacy and the
       neo-Confederacy we might end up seeing rise again.  No way will the
       neo-Confederacy be bilingual.

       However, the second I saw three prostitutes in the torture room, I

       and The Tickler really nails this subject in the books.  The role
       of superior overwhelming technology in war.  The plight of
       displaced people during conflicts and how it changes good
       people.... how it changes everyone.  The use of starvation and rape
       as tools for subjugating a population.  The clash of different

       up war for control of resources and power.  Disaster

       she needs time for the Dragons to grow bigger and stronger, and
       furthermore, she needs those 200,000 slaves.... to swell her army
       to overwhelming proportions ..... Daenerys Stormborn is a pure
       strategist.
       Having said all that, my larger point is, I have to completely
       disagree with this diarists take on this episode. I loved it.
       To the diarist:
       If you knew that George R. R. Martin's first love is writing
       dramatic historical fiction, you would realize that his choice
       genre is born of striving for a painstakingly meticulous realism,
       and realism requires detail and slow paced pieces of a delicate
       long term storm. A storm that builds into a storm. The revealing
       "Melisandre informs Gendry of his royal-bastardhood" was huge to
       that persona and his character development. And the finale, of
       Jamie jumping into a bit of almost sure death to save Brie, that
       too was huge in term of revealing the dramatic change in Jamie's
       character, which is paramount to his characters transformation into
       a character that we admire.... and rewind a few minutes, to where
       he reveals that he saved 1/2 a million people of Kings Landing. He
       is an unsung hero, who was branded as "King Slayer" unjustly...
       though an accurate label, because he did "slay the mad king" ...
       but don't leave out the "mad" or what "mad" meant. Oh yeah, I know
       he is a Lannister, so everyone hates him, and he's been spoiled,
       but has he? Has he really? Yeah, he was bopping his sis... and
       yeah, he pushed our dear Bran, and so that makes him a despicable
       bastard, so he does need redemption, and the climax of this episode
       gives him that. And forgive me but, I love that naked backside so I
       can't say I minded it one bit.
       All in all, I loved this episode, but then, I love this genre, and
       I don't need a Dragon burning a man to a crisp to feel the full
       wrath of their dramatic role.  Daenerys Stormborn stood up to
       "male" authority.... and to a powerful slave owner, no less, and
       she has, again, proved her metal. That was a powerful scene, and
       forebodes of even more powerful scenes to come in the coming
       journey. Anyone who expects a rash attempt by her to go to westeros
       have not really contemplated the full numbers of opposition against
       her in westeros ... and again, those dragons need to grow much
       larger, and if you couldn't figure that out for yourself, Martin
       uses Granpa Tywin to school both his grandson AND YOU on the
       importance of letting those dragons grow to be really big with
       skulls the size of a carriage, or as they are now, which is little
       more than the size of a large apple. No, I am sorry, but anyone who
       (hasn't read the books and) thinks that she is gonna be attempting
       any attempts to retake the Iron Throne any time soon is not paying
       attention. Impatience is not a virtue in this realm. And, if you
       really immerse yourself in this realm, then you had better learn
       patience and paying attention to detail, and if you do, then you
       will be rewarded with true dramatic story telling that invokes the
       power of the subtle. That is your reward. That is real life... more
       real life than movieland LOTR flash and burn, not that I did not
       love LOTR, but this is a different genre than LOTR, it is a
       dramatic historical fiction type of storytelling genre, which is
       probably why Martin is taking so long to write his books, because
       he really takes painfully detailed patience in the writing, and I
       know how frustrating the wait for each book is, but the payoff is
       sublime. Just sayin'...

       that he is trying to track about seven would-be dynasties at once,
       not to mention their scions running off in different
       directions...part of the reason for glacial pacing is that he's
       writing about events in distant and disparate cities.
       Had he focused on ONE dynasty or ONE character, the pacing would be
       more like what we're used to.
       But the series would be far less ambitious, and far less
       interesting.

 Some Criticism Warranted ([536]3+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:

       As an aspiring writer, I have nothing but admiration for what GRRM
       has accomplished. The Game of Thrones is light years better than
       the other well known fantasy series, The Wheel of Time and The
       Sword of Truth, both in terms of writing and plotting.
       However, having said that, he does seem to be suffering from the
       same malady that the authors of those other series did -- i.e.
       bloat.
       Unfortunately, it's not that uncommon for authors of long series of
       books to lose their focus somewhat after the first few
       installments. In some cases, I get the sense that there is a shift
       in power away from the editor and toward the author when a series
       like this hits the big time, and it gets harder for the editor to
       tell the author that things are getting a little out of control.
       Whatever it is, there is no doubt that the pacing of the later
       volumes of GoT slows considerably, and it's really not got much to
       do with the problem of juggling all those dynastic storylines. I
       won't spoil anything, but suffice to say that it was often a chore
       to get through all the unnecessary detail and passages of
       introspection in the last volume. But I'm hopeful that much of that
       won't translate to the screen anyway, so it's fairly likely that
       pacing won't be as much of an issue in the TV series.
       That said, anyone hoping for the fates of many of the main
       characters in the series to be resolved soon are likely to be
       disappointed.

       There were whole (very) long passages in ADWD that could easily
       have been cut without taking away anything from the story. The
       story also seems to be spiralling out of control, with too many new
       POV characters dropping in and then disappearing. I do appreciate
       what he's creating and what he's doing (and I do love many of the
       characters!), but when it starts to feel like I need a flow chart
       to keep track of what's going on, I think things are a little out
       of control, lol.

   ..kind of business arrangement do liberal websites have with Games of
   Thrones?

   I visit Crooks & Liars, Salon.com, etc. & I see nothing but a thumbs up
   Siskel & Ebert treatment of the Games of Thrones.

   The show goes off in a thousand difference directions, has so many
   names & places to remember you need a spreadsheet to even begin to
   surmise the plot.

   The whole project is saved by the great acting of Peter Dinklage (the
   princely dwarf, Tyrion Lannister).

   Of course, the Lannister clan hates Tyrion, which leads to conflict
   with this clan over there who hates that clan over here who claims a
   princess with pet dragons.

   Take away the Dinklage character & this whole show is a bad (or good,
   depending on how you look at it) Monty Python sketch.

   because its been extended for another 'season', or 10 episodes, and it
   sure as hell feels like it, especially when you have to wait a week to
   watch another drawn out, slow episode.  Eventually, it will get there,
   but its such a let down after getting all pumped up with the Season 2
   finale, the white walkers on the march...  Oh, well.  Just show some
   more Emilia Clarke and I can slog through it with a smile.

       I've read, it adheres very closely to the novels.
       Go: read them. Martin put in a TON of work, and a lot of thought,
       and they are wonderful. I've read them twice or three times so far.
       Complex. Slow-moving. Lots of your favorite characters die.
       But they are ALL ABOUT POLITICS.
       So if politics interests you...you will enjoy the books.

       This is the world. People do these things to each other.
       We may do less of the physical torture and death in OUR society,
       but they're happening not too far away. A man our government
       sponsored and whose forces we trained was just convicted of
       genocide in Guatemala. And you can bet there's stuff very like this
       going on right now in Syria.
       In our society today we're much nicer, of course. We mostly
       restrict the torture to the emotional kind - but that can be quite
       effective, especially on people who don't have the knowledge and
       training to know how they're being manipulated and abused.
       And I sure wouldn't want to be a female Hispanic prisoner in
       Sheriff Arpaio's jail.
       People do these things to each other. The best way to PREVENT that
       is to make sure that NICE people are aware of it, and do something
       about it. Not pretend it doesn't exist.

     Though I'm not too sure of Margaery's declaration that in marrying
     Tyrion, Sansa will become the lady of Casterly Rock.

   Ah, but she didn't. The line was, "Your son--if I'm not mistaken--your
   son might be the lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday."

     One thing I really did not expect from Martin was a Theon torture
     interval. In the book, all the torture is off screen. But here it is
     again. On screen.  And just as pointless as every other Theon
     torture scene. Moving on.

   I think the purpose might have been that Martin wanted to ensure that
   no other writer took the scene too far. It's been left a bit ambiguous
   whether or not Theon got the full Varys treatment, or was mutilated in
   some other unpleasant way that might still allow him to create Issue.

   Other than those, though, I think you're spot-on: really not the best
   use of Martin's talents, especially with a couple of weddings coming
   up. In fact, I wouldn't be shocked if he had at least partial
   authorship credit on that one, too.

       I thought this episode was developmental and I liked it with the
       exception of the bare assed mama wolf making out with daddy wolf.
       It didn't have the oomph of the other scenes.
       I will say though, he is right that the bear scene didn't come off
       as well on screen as it did in the book.

       I believe he is forced to sexually perform with a female

       the pleasure of his torturer but in somewhat limited ways.  And
       he's also very ashamed for people to see the extent of his
       mutilations so there's room for speculation.  Haven't heard use of
       the name Reek in the series... his enforced filth was part of his

       but I think Martin's series is brilliant. Slow, but brilliant: and
       how can it not be slow when he's trying to pull off something this
       ambitious?
       I mean, tracking all these different characters, all these
       different would-be dynasts, and trying to keep it all together?
       OMG. Only a great writer could pull it off. Say what you will about
       George R.R. Martin, but I can't think of anyone who has tried
       anything this ambitious since Tolstoy wrote War and Peace.

   I didn't even know that Martin wrote this episode, and I thought it
   absolutely brought the goods. You are dealing with a lot of different
   characters in different places, and this also isn't the final episode
   of this season; but this was my favorite this season. The only close
   episode was 2 weeks earlier, when the Khaleesi had her first vengeance
   on the slavers. And that was my favorite scene from all of the books,
   pretty hard to top that buildup no matter who's writing the teleplay.

   a critic who gets this series. The previous two seasons were trashed by
   people with absolutely no interest in nor tolerance for fantasy.

   I remember reading the second season's review incredulously, going, but
   that's how it happened in the book! as the TV critic savaged it.

   Well. This year, the critic was all in favor, but did point out that "a
   lot of it is exposition" which, after all, is only fair. A ton of
   what's in the novels is exposition too.

   Personally, I think the whole series (TV or books, take your pick) is
   Martin's take on politics...and the body politic loses.

   Todd VanDerWerf at the AV Club had this to say, which I didn't realize
   at the time, but is spot-on:

     Finally, we have Dany, who's doing her level best to free all the
     slaves, becoming a sort of Abraham Lincoln with dragons. (Hey,
     Spielberg: Free movie idea!) Emilia Clarke is really showing the
     steel that made her one of my favorites in season one, after a
     disappointing season two that seemed to mire her in pointless
     bullshit. (This was all by design, but it didn't make it any more
     entertaining to see it happen.) What I love about how Dany is
     playing this is that her negotiations are aimed as much at the
     slaves attending the slavers as they are at the slavers themselves.
     She's the one who's figured out how to work the system to her
     advantage, and the slavers don't seem to have any clue what kind of
     game she's playing. It's in this scene that MacLaren does her best
     work, always making sure that one of those bowing slaves is in the
     shot (or even the focus of the shot) as Dany and the Yunkai rich
     dude talk. She's talking to him, but she's also talking to everybody
     in the room; conditioned not to even see everybody in the room, he
     simply can't realize what game she's truly playing.

       Since I think of the show as taking place in a Medieval world,  I
       find it jarring that most of the women are made to look so
       contemporary. I wish they'd let some of them reflect a truly
       medieval standard of beauty, maybe something more like [1255]this.

       It may seem slow at times, but when the end credits start rolling
       I'm thinking "That sure went by fast...I wish there was more. Can't
       wait till the next episode."
       My own feelings at this point in time (having not read the books):
       Arya, Tyrion, and Dany have the most interest to me. Jaime I
       wouldn't trust one second, even though he did save Brienne (who's
       another good character) from the Bear. Jon Snow and Rob Stark don't
       seem quite up to the job for me, at least at this point. And all
       the Lannisters (save Tyrion) are oh so despicable (but oh so
       watchable) that you just keep hoping for their comeuppance (though
       given the twists that GRRM has supplied so far I guessing they'll
       be around quite a while--got to have a good villain, or set of
       villains, and they sure are that.) And if you must have torture, do
       a good share of it offscreen where a closing door followed by
       screaming (or a cut-away) can be just as effective (maybe even more
       so, think Hitchcock and the "Psycho" shower scene where we never
       actually see the knife penetrate but is still scary as hell.) It's
       getting to be just plain gratuitous now and does nothing more to
       further advance the story, plot, or character...we get it already.

       Rhapsody in Blue happens to be my favorite classical work. And it
       is intricate (I once tried to play the piano version...could barely
       read the sheet music for it) so that's why it works for me: when I
       am hearing Rhapsody in Blue, whether in life or in my head, there
       is no room for any other melody, no matter how good the hooks.

   This may have been pointed out in earlier diaries but one of the strong
   points of the series (and books) is Martin's ability to expose the the
   fact that simple, rigid honor as personified by the Starks is at least
   as destructive as the greed of the Lannisters. There would be no war if
   Ned had seized Joffrey with no intent to harm and assumed the regency,
   as other, more politic allies urged him to do after Robert's death.
   Winterfell wouldn't be a smoking ruin if Rob Stark's honor didn't send
   Theon Greyjoy back to the eel pit that is Pyle instead of a more
   experienced and less compromised ambassador. The Starks wear their
   honor as if it were armor when in reality it is a blinder as opaque as
   the covetousness of  Lannisters.

   Excellent series and excellent books. (Although the torture of Theon in
   the series has become the most obscene thing I've ever seen on
   television. Enough.)

 Martin needs to man up and write some BOOKS ([1369]0+ / 0-)

   about the only thing I want to hear or read about Mr. G. R.R.
   "IwannabeTolkien" Martin is that he has finished Books 6 and 7. I fell
   for his crap at the end of 3 that he couldn't wrap it up in only one
   book and thus 4 evolved into both 4 and book 5. as 5 got to the halfway
   point, I realized, too late, that there was way too much slave-saving
   going on (not that there's anything wrong with that) and way too little
   getting the Unsullied and Dragons on some boats to Westeros. I don't
   think he WANTS to wrap it up. and at this point, I doubt seriously that
   the next butt on the Iron Throne will be some character we have even
   met in books 1 through 5.

   I have the same feeling that the Tarnsmen of Gor gave me around Book 8
   in 1974. This thing will never be over. So I went to college and forgot
   about John Norman and Tarl Cabot completely.

 POSSIBLE SPOILER ([1402]0+ / 0-)

   *

   MAYBE a spoiler alert

   *

   OK, just finished reading all 5 books.

   I AGREE with whoever used the word "bloat" to describe the books.

   After 5 books, the story has not progressed very far.  For example, and
   here is the spoiler:

   Daenerys is still wandering around freeing slaves instead of heading
   back to Westeros!!!!

   Some prominent characters are dead.  I'm assuming some of them will
   actually die this season on HBO.  There are two really good death
   events in book three that would make for spectacular season-enders.

   Other people are teased to be dead, and then show up 20 chapters later,
   (or a whole book later ) not dead.  I have figured out that when GRRM
   writes a cliffhanger chapter where a character "dies", unless you hear
   their head hit the ground with a loud THUMP, it's just a tease and the
   person will show up later, maybe worse for the wear, but still alive
   and plotting/kicking/searching/wandering/whatever.  Oh, and that
   chapter heading will use some OTHER name for that character, so you
   don't figure it out right away.

   I'm not sure I care how this monstrosity ends anymore.  If I were a
   masochist, I would go back, summarize each chapter with the one REAL
   thing that happens in that chapter, include notes about when the
   hypothetical dead person resurfaces, and what their new alias is, and
   post it all on a weblog.

   Wait, maybe someone already did that?  And here I wasted WEEKS reading
   the damn things.
