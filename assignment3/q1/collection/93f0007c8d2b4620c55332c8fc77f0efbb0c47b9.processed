[22]Battle Los Angeles: What's at stake in Tuesday's election

   LAUSD Board Member Steve Zimmer: under a million-dollar assault from
   the privatization movement
   Politicos in Los Angeles don't get a break after presidential
   elections, and not simply because it's never too early to gear up for
   the next cycle. Rather, the city of Los Angeles has a peculiar election
   schedule: Our municipal elections, as well as those of many other
   cities and districts in Los Angeles County, happen to occur on the
   first Tuesday in March of odd-numbered years. That means that as soon
   as the big November elections are over, those of us who care about what
   happens in our own city have to turn out focus immediately to the next
   big election a mere four months away. Most of the time, it's not so
   bad. We haven't had a contentious mayoral election since 2005, and the
   downballot races, such as city council and school board, are usually
   more local concerns without anything of major interest to national
   observers. The 2013 election, however, is one of the most contentious
   and high-profile municipal cycles in recent memory. Mayor Antonio
   Villaraigosa is termed out and will be leaving office on June 30 of
   this year, and the battle to replace him has become very expensive, and
   very negative.

   Unless a miracle occurs, that race will not be decided in March; if no
   candidate gets a majority--and, given the number of well-funded
   candidates, this is the strong likelihood--the top two candidates will
   proceed to a runoff on May 21. Two candidates are widely expected to
   make it into that runoff: former City Council President Eric Garcetti,
   and City Controller Wendy Greuel, both of whom had raised close to $5
   million as of the last reporting period. Garcetti, who endorsed Barack
   Obama as far back as 2007, was a California co-chair for both the 2008
   and 2012 campaigns, and is the [29]chair emeritus of the organization
   of Democratic Municipal Officials. Greuel got her start with Mayor Tom
   Bradley before joining President Clinton's administration working under
   Secretary Cisneros in the the Department of Housing and Urban
   Development. While Garcetti and Greuel have led in both public polls
   and fundraising and are poised to do battle until May, two other
   candidates have an outside shot: a third Democrat, Councilmember Jan
   Perry, who represents downtown and parts of South Los Angeles; and
   Republican attorney and radio host Kevin James, whose candidacy is
   [30]primarily bankrolled by a Super PAC created by fellow GOP
   strategist Fred Davis. (Full disclosure: I have endorsed Eric
   Garcetti.)

   Follow me below the fold to find out what's at stake in this election.

   Also up for election--and also likely to head to a runoff, given the
   number of candidates involved--are the other citywide races on the
   ballot: city attorney and city controller. In the former race, former
   Assemblyman Mike Feuer, who is endorsed by the Democratic Party, is
   challenging incumbent City Attorney Carmen Trutanich, whose old law
   firm [31]still represents the National Rifle Association and the rest
   of the gun rights lobby. In the city controller race, Democrat Ron
   Galperin, who has the party's endorsement, is running against a
   somewhat crowded field to replace the aforementioned Wendy Greuel, who
   has foregone the possibility of a second term in the controller's
   office to run for mayor.

   Those are the races that are getting the most attention, but in all
   three cases, it is likely that we will have another eleven weeks to
   sort them out. There is one race, however, that will be decided this
   Tuesday, and has attracted national attention that would seem to far
   outweigh the scale of the race: the race for Los Angeles Unified School
   Board, District Four. The Fourth District [32]includes most of West Los
   Angeles and Venice, and is currently represented by Boardmember Steve
   Zimmer, who is running for reelection. Zimmer has the support of United
   Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA), which represents classroom teachers in the
   city, as well as the Democratic Party. However, as Laura Clawson
   [33]wrote last week, he is under severe attack.

   Zimmer is being challenged by Kate Anderson, a community activist in
   Venice who, whether she wanted to or not, has become the vessel for the
   billionaires who want to privatize our schools. The independent
   expenditure spending in this race [34]dwarfs the amount the candidates
   themselves are spending on the race, and the numbers tell the tale: It
   is an all-out war, with the teachers on one side supporting Steve
   Zimmer, and charter school groups and the so-called "Coalition for
   School Reform" going all in to kick Steve Zimmer out of office. As of
   the last reporting period, each side has spent roughly $1 million in
   support of their respective candidates.

   And who is funding this Coalition for School Reform? The usual
   privatizers and billionaires. Michelle Rhee's [35]StudentsFirst, which
   has given a quarter million to the group. As Clawson wrote, Mayor
   Bloomberg has given a full million, and several other members of the
   one percent have given their fair share of six-figure contributions.
   Unlike the other March races that are consuming more of the political
   oxygen, this race will be decided on Tuesday: There are only two
   candidates, which means that one of them will get a majority. Most
   other things on the March ballot in Los Angeles will be decided in May,
   but what will get decided on Tuesday is this: Will a group of outsider
   privatizers and billionaires who want to dismantle our public education
   system be able to use their unlimited personal wealth to buy a seat on
   my local school board, and unseat someone just because he stood with
   teachers?

   The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second-largest in the
   country, which means that the stakes here are potentially bigger than
   anywhere else in the country. If the billionaires get their way in Los
   Angeles, it will set a very dangerous precedent.

   (Many other municipalities and districts in Los Angeles County are
   holding elections this Tuesday. The Los Angeles County Democratic Party
   hosts a thorough endorsement process in every single race on the
   ballot. You can see those endorsements [36]here.)

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health

   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Wendy Greuel has been a favorite of many (myself included) for a long
   time and Garcetti also has solid support. Seems like either way we get
   a Mayor we can be proud of.

   And I second what MoeizW asks above...

 I think LAs the largest district with elections. ([105]8+ / 0-)

   NYC, Chicago and 8 other major cities have school boards appointed by
   the mayor and other pols.

   LA should look into that.

   Some good government types disagree, but it puts the responsibility for
   the schools in the mayor's lap and generally avoids the most egregious
   examples of for-profits buying up seats on the school board (though
   they still have too much influence).

   BTW:

   Chicago's school board president recently shut down two charters and
   put 6 on a warning list for poor performance. Happy days!

 As both Democratic leaders for mayor ([155]0+ / 0-)

   are pretty much the same (I voted for Garcetti.  I know him, he
   probably would have had more power as president of the city council,
   but term limits again are forcing good people out of jobs they can do
   competently.  Also, Eric was a Howard Dean supporter and was endorsed
   by Dean.)

   BUT THE big race is for City Attorney, and Mike Feuer is running
   against a self promoting thug named Carmen Trutanich who has been pain
   in the ass since he got elected four years ago.  Mike is supported by
   both the LA Times and has the majority of endorsements.

   I would like to see Mike win in the primary.

 party endorsements ([158]0+ / 0-)

   Local races like this, where a little unscrupulous outside money goes a
   long way, show the value of local parties making endorsements. What if
   Robin Kelly hadn't run a great campaign in IL-02? A party endorsement
   might have knocked off the NRA fart-catchers even before Bloomberg's
   money.

 Thanks, Dante! ([161]0+ / 0-)

   As someone who has been mostly focused on helping Garcetti win, and the
   local West Hollywood race (as much as a foregone conclusion that might
   be), the School Board race had run completely under my radar (but not
   my mailbox!).

   I had met Steve years ago at a WH Dems meeting, and can vouch for his
   principles of a good, high-quality, PUBLIC education for our children.

   Local elections are often high rewarding because you get to have a
   greater role in the political process and the entire process is far
   more intimate.

   What separates us, divides us, and diminishes the human spirit.

   by [162]equern on [163]Mon Mar 04, 2013 at 12:33:56 PM PST



 Looks different to me - Measure A is the most ([164]0+ / 0-)

   item on the ballot. The next Mayor will be a Democrat. Garcetti is
   glamorous and he was a Dean supporter, but he, and even more so the two
   ladies Wendy Greuel and Jan Perry are fiscally irresponsible developer
   enablers, just like Antonio el Corupto. Measure A is a sales tax
   increase. Right now, about 53% of likely voters say that they will vote
   for it, but polls are less valid than 30 years ago because of bias by
   pollsters and the fact that so few people will speak to pollsters on
   the phone- you get a slanted population.
   If the sales tax increase passes, the next mayor will continue his or
   her flawed policies, assuming that money will keep them going. If it
   fails, even Greuel with her talk of cutting the fat and hiring more
   policemen (think Schwarzenegger), will probably become more cautious.
   Is enough being spent to maintain city infrastructure? As one who
   drives the 110 freeway through the city three days a week, I don't
   think so. As a public sector physician, I know that County facilities
   and especially mental health facilities are crumbling.

   I live in Pasadena. We have problems but Glendale and Pasadena are
   doing very well financially. I'm hoping that Pasadena will pull
   together with places like Arcadia and other San Gabriel Valley centers
   and grow away from LA, and its corrupt city council, doing more to
   improve K-12 and higher education and facing up to our serious
   inequality problem.
