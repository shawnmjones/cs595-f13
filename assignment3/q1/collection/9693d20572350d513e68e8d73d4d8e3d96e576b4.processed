     I have never heard of of a situation where [union employees] sued
     their supervisor and you for blocking them from following the law.
     They weren't complaining about pay, working conditions or benefits.
     [...] - [30]Jefferson Beauregard Sessions



   In an amazing display of "concern" for working union folk, Republican
   Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is very concerned about the
   public sector union, led by one Chris Crane, that represents some ICE
   agents. Of course this is not a typical management-labor dispute over
   "pay, working conditions, or benefits." For if it was, we know what
   Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, or any Republican,  would be saying.
   [31]something like this:

     Democrats in Congress are pushing to extend union protection to
     43,000 federal airport security workers, reviving a debate that
     stalled the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and
     could now derail broad antiterrorism legislation. The proposal has
     provoked opposition from Senate Republicans and the Bush
     administration. It is the latest in a series of labor-related fights
     in Washington as Democrats try to use their new majority to push
     long-delayed proposals that benefit rank-and-file workers, like
     increasing the minimum wage. [...]

     "Existing authority permits T.S.A. the flexibility to manage and
     deploy their work force," Scott Stanzel, the White House deputy
     press secretary, said. "We do think that it is important that T.S.A.
     maintain that flexibility for personnel performing key homeland
     security roles."

   So "flexibility to manage and deploy their workforce" is important when
   issues like "pay, working conditions or benefits" is at issue--no
   mooching unions then. But, as Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, makes
   clear, this is not about that. What is it about? It is about
   [32]getting rid of the brown people:

     Disgruntled Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are suing
     their bosses over changes made to deportation policy by President
     Barack Obama. A lawsuit filed Thursday on behalf of 10 ICE agents
     against the head of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet
     Napolitano, and ICE Director John Morton asks the courts to overturn
     the June 15 directive by Obama to suspend deportation proceedings
     and offer work authorization to some immigrants brought here
     illegally as children. [...]

     "The Directive commands ICE officers to violate federal law," the
     lawsuit says. Chris Crane, the president of ICE agents' union who is
     suing Napolitano and Morton, accused the Obama administration of
     ignoring the demands of ICE agents when formulating the new policy.
     "We've repeatedly tried to work with the administration and they've
     just excluded us from everything since day one," Crane said on a
     conference call with reporters announcing the lawsuit.

   It appears that Chris Crane and these "disgruntled" ICE agents want to
   dictate immigration policy. As of yet, none has announced that they are
   running for President of the United States.  Last I looked, it was the
   president and his designees who set the policy for enforcement of
   immigration laws, among many, many others. Hell, even generals have to
   follow the directives of the president. What makes Chris Crane so
   special? Nothing. But, when it comes to brown people, Republicans will
   embrace any means necessary, including the embrace of public sector
   service unions, to accomplish their stated goals, getting rid of brown
   people.

   More on the multipronged attack on brown people by Republicans in all
   branches of government on the flip.

   So Joe Arpaio wannabe Chris Crane wants to form his own posses to root
   out the brown people. Say this for Arapaio, at least he runs for
   office. Chris Crane works for the President. He is certainly entitled
   to his opinions and to state them, but what is his job? Janet
   Napolitano explained how she sees it:

     Here's what I expect as a former federal prosecutor and attorney
     general: and that is law enforcement agents will enforce the law in
     accord with the guidance they are given from their superiors and
     that is what we ask of ICE, that's what we ask of border patrols and
     what we ask throughout the department and I believe that is
     consistent with all law enforcement

     Agents don't set enforcement priorities, those are set by their
     superiors and they are asked  to obey that guidance in accord with
     the law.

   I'm not sure who would disagree with that, except of course,
   Republicans when it comes to their goal of getting rid of brown people
   by any means necessary. If it serves that goal, then Republican love
   public sector unions who parrot their nonsense, they love employee
   challenges to directives set by their superiors, and they love
   lawsuits.

   For Chris Crane did not stop with his press conferences and shilling
   for the GOP war on Latinos, he decided to file a suit instead. A
   lawsuit filed by [33]Kris Kobach, the mastermind behind such brown
   people hating laws like [34]Arizona's struck down SB 1070.

   And remarkably, a federal judge in Dallas, [35]Reed O'Connor, a George
   W. Bush appointee to be sure, [36]decided Chris Crane and his fellow
   "disgruntled" ICE  agents had standing to challenge the directives of
   their superiors regarding immigration enforcement priorities. How in
   gawd's name did he manage to do that? By making it up of course:

     [T]he ICE Agent Plaintiffs assert that they have suffered an
     injury-in-fact by virtue of being compelled to violate a federal
     statute upon pain of adverse employment action. Pls.' Resp. Mot.
     Dismiss 2-7, ECF No. 30. Plaintiffs allege that the Directive and
     the Morton Memorandum require them to choose between (1) complying
     with the Directive and the Morton Memorandum and consequently
     violating their statutory duties under federal law and (2) violating
     the Directive and the Morton Memorandum and being disciplined as a
     result. Id. Defendants' response to this basis of standing is
     essentially the same as their response to the issue of
     violation-of-oath standing: Defendants contend that the ICE Agent
     Plaintiffs have not alleged a sufficient injury-in-fact because they
     have not alleged that they will "personally suffer any adverse
     consequence as a result of implementing the challenged memoranda."
     Defs.' Reply Mot. Dismiss 1, ECF No. 33. For the reasons set forth
     below, the Court finds that the ICE Agent Plaintiffs have alleged a
     sufficient injury in-fact to satisfy the constitutional requirements
     of standing.

     The ICE Agent Plaintiffs allege that compliance with the Directive
     and Morton Memorandum would require them to violate their statutory
     obligations under the Immigration and Nationality Act ("INA"). Pls.'
     Am. Compl. ¶¶ 37-40, ECF No. 15; see generally 8 U.S.C. §§
     1101-1537. The INA provides that "[a]n alien present in the United
     States who has not been admitted . . . shall be deemed for purposes
     of this chapter an applicant for admission." 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a)(1).
     All applicants for
     admission "shall be inspected by immigration officers." Id. §
     1225(a)(3). "[I]f the examining immigration officer determines that
     an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt
     entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a
     proceeding under section 1229a [of the INA]." Id. § 1225(b)(2)(A).
     The ICE Agent Plaintiffs assert that these statutory provisions
     require them to arrest or issue an NTA to illegal aliens whenever
     those aliens "are not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be
     admitted" to the United States. Pls.' Am. Compl. ¶¶ 37-40, ECF No.
     15; Pls.' Resp. Mot. Dismiss 2-3, ECF No. 30. Because
     Directive-eligible aliens may not be "clearly and beyond a doubt
     entitled to be admitted," Plaintiffs allege that federal law
     requires them to arrest
     those aliens or issue an NTA. Pls.' Am. Compl. ¶¶ 37-40, ECF No. 15;
     Pls.' Resp. Mot. Dismiss 2-3, ECF No. 30. The Directive and the
     Morton Memorandum, in contrast, require the ICE Agent Plaintiffs to
     defer action against Directive-eligible aliens. Pls.' Resp. Mot.
     Dismiss 3, ECF No. 30. The ICE Agent Plaintiffs "fear, based upon
     official communications to them, . . . that if they follow the
     requirements of federal law, contrary to the Directive, and arrest
     an alien or issue an alien a notice to Appear (NTA) in removal
     proceedings, they will be disciplined or suffer other adverse
     employment consequences." Pls.' Am. Compl. ¶ 49, ECF No. 15.

     Here, the Directive and the Morton Memorandum require Plaintiffs to
     defer action against illegal aliens who satisfy the criteria set out
     in the Directive. Pls.' Am. Compl. Ex. 1 (Directive), at 2, ECF No.
     15-1. Plaintiffs have made it clear that they do not intend to
     comply with the Directive and the Morton Memorandum by deferring
     action for Directive-eligible aliens. Pls.' Am. Compl. ¶¶ 50-58, ECF
     No. 15. Rather, Plaintiffs intend to comply with what they believe
     to be their statutory obligations by arresting or issuing an NTA to
     any illegal aliens who are not "clearly and beyond a doubt entitled
     to be admitted" to the United States, which may include some
     Directive eligible aliens. See 8. U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A). Plaintiffs
     face the threat of disciplinary action if they engage in this
     intended course of conduct and violate the commands of the Directive
     by arresting or issuing an NTA to a Directive-eligible alien. See
     Pls.' Am. Compl. ¶ 49, ECF No. 15. There is "no question" that the
     ICE Agent Plaintiffs have sufficient standing as plaintiffs under
     these circumstances: the Directive and the Morton Memorandum are
     specifically directed at the ICE Agent Plaintiffs; the Directive and
     the Morton Memorandum require them to make significant changes in
     the way they carry out their duties; and if they fail to comply with
     the Directive and the Morton Memorandum they will be exposed to
     adverse employment consequences. See Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387
     U.S. 136, 154 (1967). An adverse employment action, or the threat
     thereof, constitutes an injury-in-fact. See United States v. City of
     Miami, Fla., 664 F.2d 435, 446 (Former 5th Cir. Dec.
     1981) (en banc) (per curiam) (finding that plaintiffs suffered the
     requisite injury-in-fact to satisfy the requirements of Article III
     where decree allowed plaintiffs who passed a civil service test to
     be passed over for promotions); see also Shanahan v. City of Chi.,
     82 F.3d 776, 780 (7th Cir. 1996) (finding that plaintiff suffered an
     adequate injury-in-fact when he was demoted to his former position).
     The Court finds that the potential disciplinary action that results
     from failing to comply with the Directive and the Morton Memorandum
     constitutes a sufficient injury-in-fact to satisfy the
     constitutional requirements of standing.5 Accordingly, the Court
     finds that the ICE Agent Plaintiffs have alleged a sufficient
     injury-in fact to satisfy the constitutional requirements of
     standing. Furthermore, the alleged injury is directly traceable to
     the Defendants' conduct in issuing and enforcing the Directive and
     Morton Memorandum, and a favorable decision by this Court would
     likely redress the injury. Accordingly, the Court finds that the ICE
     Agent Plaintiffs have met their burden of establishing the
     constitutional requirements of standing to challenge the portions of
     the Directive and the Morton Memorandum related to the exercise of
     prosecutorial discretion.



   It would not be surprising if your head is spinning after reading this
   utter nonsense. The ICE agents complaint boils down to they do not want
   to follow the directives of their superiors because they do not agree
   with their superior's (1) interpretation of the law and (2) policy
   priorities, and they intend to disobey their superiors. Voila!
   Standing!

   Would that this "federal employee standing doctrine" had existed when
   Bush was President. Can you imagine all the SEC, EPA, DOJ and other
   agency employees going to court to challenge all the stupidities and
   illegalities that Administration perpetrated? But of course there is no
   such standing doctrine and nor should their be. Heck, this rogue judge
   points to why in the same opinion:

     Defendants assert that Finch and Donelon establish that, in the
     Fifth Circuit, if an alleged violation of one's oath "is the only
     consequence that flows from upholding a challenged law, a plaintiff
     cannot establish standing by suggesting that a refusal to uphold the
     law will result in injury." Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 14, ECF No. 23. The
     Court agrees. Here, the ICE Agent Plaintiffs are suing to ensure
     that the Directive and Morton Memorandum comply with their opinion
     of what federal law requires. See Donelon, 522 F.3d at 568; see also
     Finch, 585 F.2d at 774. The ICE Agent Plaintiffs have alleged that
     they will be disciplined if they refuse to comply with the Directive
     and the Morton Memorandum. However, they have not alleged that they
     will be disciplined if they comply with the Directive and Morton
     Memorandum. They allege, instead, that complying with the Directive
     and Morton Memorandum will cause them to violate their oaths to
     uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States. Because the
     ICE Agent Plaintiffs have not alleged that any negative consequence
     apart from the violation of their oath will flow from complying with
     the challenged Directive and Morton Memorandum, they have failed to
     allege a sufficient injury-in-fact under the Fifth Circuit's
     interpretation of violation-of-oath standing. See Donelon, 522 F.3d
     at 568; Finch, 585 F.2d at 774.4.

   How this rogue judge can square that with his finding of standing, only
   he can explain.  To an honest rational person, they are irreconcilable.
   The irony drips, of course, because a key Republican judicial project
   for decades has been [37]to block people from vindicating their rights
   in court:

     The Supreme Court's Article III standing doctrine has plagued
     liberal
     groups for nearly forty years. Recently, however, the doctrine has
     blocked a number of conservative lawsuits opposing gay marriage, the
     2010 health care law, and the expansion of federal funding for
     stem-cell research. What can we learn from these cases? Because
     contemporary criticisms of standing doctrine have usually come from
     the left and defenses from the right, it is commonplace to associate
     arguments for broad standing with left wing political agendas. But,
     as some scholars have shown, older versions of standing doctrine
     served liberal purposes in the New Deal and its immediate
     aftermath. The current strict standing doctrine, now keeping
     conservative activists out of federal court, may have returned to
     its roots.

   For a judge who wants to decide a case, any contortion is acceptable.
   And yes, this judge wanted to decide the case, and decide it he did, he
   found [38]the directives illegal, which should surprise precisely no
   one.

   After all, like most Republicans, this rogue judge believes in getting
   rid of brown people by any means necessary.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       about the Pendleton Act but there is a statute that provides an
       exclusive procedure for federal employee grievances that should
       have been followed.

       so, Judge O'Connor wasn't sufficiently briefed on an already
       existing statute that outlines a procedure for fed employees to
       follow (and they obviously decided not to follow, which raises more

   They aren't doing what their jobs require - that is do what their
   supervisors tell them to do.

   If they disagree with those rules and supervisors - they can quit. No
   one is forcing them to keep their jobs and I am sure there are plenty
   of people who would be willing to get that good Federal pay and
   benefits and follow the rules they are given.

   in 1950.  I went to a segregated Catholic school.  I remember when
   there were candies called n**er babies and brazil nuts were called
   n**er toes.  I also remember my mother throwing my uncle out of the
   house for using the "N" word.  I also know that most of my extended
   family except my mother and my now dead father and me (hopefully) are
   in your face racists.

   That being said, I know my Mom has problems with "illegals" except for
   her "illegals."  Meaning folks she loves in her church and her former
   brilliant gardener.  She's in CA and listens to the crap from the RW
   which involves most of her age group.

   Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is a being (caricature) from my youth.  A
   flat out racist and still harboring a grudge for being denied a federal

 Isn't it somewhat ironic that the administration ([469]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [470]Odysseus

   which has deported more Latinos than any other is now being sued for
   not deporting fast enough?

   Is that what happens when a federal agency is so full of itself and its
   lofty goals that they lose sense of who they work for?

   Is it any surprise that Republicans are leading their rebranding by
   complaining about [471]volumes which beat the pants off Bush's record?

     As of July [2012], Obama deported 1.4 million illegal immigrants
     since the beginning of his administration -- that's 1.5 times more
     immigrants on average than Bush deported every month, according to
     official numbers from the Department of Homeland Security

   For a president who promised immigration reform in the first year of
   his presidency, but then failed to offer any program until 4 years
   later this whole thing is really... well, humorous is wrong, because
   people's lives are being torn apart, families destroyed, children left
   without parents.  So, "ironic" will have to do for now.

   Obama set the pace for massive deportations. [472]His administration
   made deportation quotas part of the immigration agents' performance
   reviews.

   And now when he'd like to cut back (why now and not 3-4 years ago?),
   he's being challenged by exactly those same agents who were ordered and
   harangued to get their numbers up.

   Is it any wonder, really, that people question the sudden shift? Why
   was it important to Obama to push deportations to such high levels over
   the last 4 years?  Does anyone think he really cares?

 Just to be clear on the numbers: ([475]0+ / 0-)
       Bush deported approx 2 million over 8 years of his presidency.
       Obama has deported 1.4 million in his first term - 4 years.
       On a per month basis, Obama is deporting 1.5 times as many human
       beings.
       Quotas (link in comment above):

     Since November, ICE field offices in Northern California, Dallas and
     Chicago have issued new evaluation standards and work plans for
     enforcement agents who remove illegal immigrants from jails and
     prisons. In some cases, for example, the field offices are requiring
     that agents process an average of 40 to 60 cases a month to earn
     "excellent" ratings.

     Such standards present a problem, said one San Francisco area agent
     who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal. Instead
     of taking a day to prepare a case against a legal resident with
     multiple convictions for serious crimes, agents may choose to
     process a drunk driver or nonviolent offender who agrees to leave
     the country voluntarily, because it will take only hours.
       Bush had quotas too:

     Under the Bush administration, ICE officials in 2006 increased an
     annual quota from 125 to 1,000 arrests for each fugitive operations
     team. At the same time, the agency dropped its policy that agents
     focus on criminals and deportation violators.

 Obama put HCR before Immigration reform. ([479]0+ / 0-)
       Of course he technically failed to put forth an immigration plan in
       his first term, but suggesting that he did simply because he wanted
       to deport more aliens than Bush is disingenuous.
       I think his strategy has been vindicated by his re-election. He's
       put forth a strategy now because he doesn't have to face any
       electoral consequences for being the Muslim President who wants to
       give amnesty illegals. I'd say that his hand is a lot stronger
       after he was re-elected by a large, multi-racial coalition than
       before.

     What you don't realize is that White people have not consented to
     having their borders opened to non-White immigration...period. This
     is something that has been FORCED down the throats of White people
     and ONLY White people. We have been systematically targeted for a
     particular form of genocide, in this case a force-assimilation.
     White people have not consented to being assimilated out of
     existence, that's what makes this a genocide.
     Anti-racist is a codeword¿ for ANTI-WHITE.

 It's really all about this: ([497]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [498]bmcphail

     Because Congress has the power to legislate in the area of
     immigration law and has expressed its intent to require the
     initiation of removal proceedings against aliens when the
     requirements of Section 1225(b)(2)(A) are satisfied, the Court finds
     that DHS does not have discretion to refuse to initiate removal
     proceedings when the requirements of Section 1225(b)(2)(A) are
     satisfied.

   Racism by a Republican judge as the impetus for this, which could be
   implied from your diary title, is more than a stretch.  Besides, not
   all detainees are brown, Armando.

   I can see why someone would question following what they consider to be
   an unlawful order without an OK from the Court.  Apparently, their
   concerns were warranted.

   Making policy is one thing, refusing to enforce the law, as written, is
   another thing.  Even the President's actions are constrained by the
   law.   Suppose the President decided, as a matter of policy, to not to
   prosecute insider trading.   Oh, wait a minute.   Never mind.
