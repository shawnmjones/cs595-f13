[24]Sarah Palin blasts Rubio, rallies the troops against immigration reform

   Sarah Palin pointing her finger
   Nope, still not going away.
   Well great, now Marco Rubio has drawn Sarah Palin's ire for his
   involvement with immigration reform. Sarah Palin, the high priestess of
   the [30]conservative base!

     "Just like they did with Obamacare, some in Congress intend to
     `Pelosi' the amnesty bill," Palin posted on Facebook on Monday,
     referring to the liberal Democratic House leader, Nancy Pelosi.
     "They'll pass it in order to find out what's in it. And just like
     the unpopular, unaffordable Obamacare disaster, this pandering,
     rewarding-the-rule-breakers, still-no-border-security,
     special-interests-ridden, 24-pound disaster of a bill is not
     supported by informed Americans.

   All right, I'm not sure I follow much of that, but I have it the good
   authority of several tea party-to-English translators that she doesn't
   like immigration reform because of reasons. She went on to attack Rubio
   by name as an "amnesty supporter" and made a prediction:

     "As the Senate moves to pass amnesty, the only bright spot in this
     travesty is the rallying revolution we can look forward to," Palin
     wrote on Monday. "For just as opposition to Obamacare became a
     rallying cry for the 2010 midterm elections, opposition to this
     fundamentally transforming amnesty bill will galvanize the grass
     roots in next year's elections. And 2014 is just around the corner."

   Sounds like that's a threat aimed more at Republicans than Democrats, a
   suggestion that anyone not toeing the line on this issue is going to
   find themselves booted. This is where I still find things sketchy--yes,
   it's in the Republican Party's long-term interest to support
   immigration reform, but expecting the current rabid base to view
   anything in the "long term" is, well, insane. For people like Sarah
   Palin, "long term" is the span of an entire governor's tenure or Fox
   News contract period, and you can't expect them to pay attention that
   long.

   So how do you get a very small, very loud, conspicuously racially
   motivated base to support a push towards a more inclusive
   party--especially when the base's heroes are so very cranky about it?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [49]Tagging tips - [50]Search For Tags - [51]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       I hope they do get the crazies and anti-immigrants and anti-women
       portions of their party to come out and dominate the primaries and
       conventions.  And then I want the country to come out and refudiate
       the Republican party en masse.  Probably won't change much in terms
       of policy, but it will be so good to have Speaker Pelosi back and
       not have to hear about the problems in the House anymore.  Now, if
       we could get another dozen seats in the Senate, we might actually
       get some things accomplished...

       Sarah Palin shot it from an helicopter, fleeced it, skinned it,
       butchered it, detailed it and fed the leftovers and the entrails to
       a Mama Grizzly which happened to be around.
       Or something like that.

   You helped John McCain lose the 2008 election---even my rabidly
   republican mama could not stomach voting for a ticket w/you on it---and
   I have confidence that w/your anti-immigration reform rants you could
   be successful in helping the republicans lose the mid terms, and
   certainly lose the next presidential election.

   Such talent. And people say you don't matter?! What are they thinking?
   Of course you matter. You keep the same old crazies all jazzed up, and
   the media loves your glasses, your hairdos and your spunky gal schtick!
   You make it harder for the moderate wing of your party to "re-brand"
   itself so your party will look more irrelevant, more sexist, more
   racist, whiter, older, grumpier and greedier by the day.

   I don't care what they say. You are making significant contributions.

   Since Hunter's diaries are so good, we wouldn't want to leave anyone
   out.

   So here is the translation into Tea Party:

     The Tea Party sucks

 So, if she's pissed at Rubio ([678]0+ / 0-)

   How does she feel about Miss Lindsey supporting the bill as well?

   Also, I object to the use of the term "high priestess" in the same
   sentence with Caribou Barbie.  High Priestess should be a term of
   respect, not a throwaway term to be used on the likes of her, the head
   honcho of the misinformed and ignorant.

   harsh crackling report of Half Term's voice. It appears that the sly
   FOX, and coxswain manning Murdoch's man-of-war, Adventure Galley, has a
   soft spot in his heart for the 'ol picaroon. She'll be given a second
   crack at being a full term scallywag, and to give no quarter to the
   bilge rats listing to the left. LOAD THE SIX POUNDERS, SHE'S COMING
   ABOUT! Arr!

 Three possible reasons to quote her ([688]0+ / 0-)

   1. Because she's still relevant.
   2. Because of a desire to help her stay relevant by giving her
   publicity.
   3. Because her analysis and insights are valuable and need to be
   brought to people's attention.

   Any of those is a sufficiently odd belief that anyone quoting her has
   the obligation to identify the particular reason and defend it.

   Freedom isn't free. Patriots pay taxes.

 Sarah Palin has half a mind to attack... ([691]0+ / 0-)

   Sen. McCain for his support of the immigration bill, but Sen. Rubio has
   been designated as the "dirty bastard" in this fight. Watch out for
   when Sarah learns how to use her other half.

   Despite all the bullshit from the right about death panels and
   socialism and the end of the world, Obama care did pass, and was also
   upheld by the Supreme Court.  A year from now all the major components
   will be enacted and citizens will begin to feel the benefits.  Ten
   years from now people will be wondering what all the fuss was about and
   what people did without access to health insurance.  And you will be
   even more irrelevant than you are now.

   For a woman that emigrated to this country from Canada.  Of Course
   history doesn't matter and facts don't matter to her, she just runs her
