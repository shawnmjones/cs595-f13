Mississippi story takes a turn

   The news about [3]Mississippi failing until this year to ratify the
   13th Amendment, banning slavery, just got more interesting.

   Commenter @Sylvain writes about having worked as a journalist covering
   then Mississippi Secretary of State Dick Molpus, who [4]took the heat
   for failing to send in the paperwork after the legislature voted for
   ratification in 1995. Nationally, Molpus looked like the white,
   Southern Secretary of State who messed up the anti-slavery amendement.
   But at home in Mississippi, Molpus is known for having taken a stand
   for equality and justice in a way that [5]cost him
   politically. @Sylvain notes his record on that, and [6]writes:

     As for this registration issue, yes, in the end, the buck stops with
     him. But if you get the chance to visit a secretary of state's
     office, you will see that it's more than one guy and maybe a
     secretary or two. It's a huge operation charged with such tasks as
     certifying corporations and securing business filings. Go one day
     and get an education.

   @Sylvain's point -- that a Secretary of State's office is not just one
   person -- turns out to be quite salient. Reporter Jerry Mitchell of the
   Jackson Clarion-Ledger circled back yesterday for an interview with the
   Assistant Secretary of State who says she mailed in the paperwork, and
   if you want to blame anyone, blame her. Constance Slaughter-Harvey was
   herself a veteran of the Civil Rights movement. [7]From Mitchell's
   post:

     She distinctly remembers sending in the final paperwork in 1995 to
     have the 13th Amendment ratified, she said. "That was taken care of.
     That was important to me."

   Below, video of Slaughter-Henry talking about integrating the law
   school at Ole Miss. You can see why she's a local legend, and why she
   didn't come this far not to mail in that paperwork. What went wrong is
   still a mystery, for now, but I suspect we're getting closer.

   Obviously, someone messep up somewhere in Mississippi. But what about
   someone or some people higher up in Congress? After the 1995
   ratification, should Congress then have been insisting that Mississippi
   help complete the certification? And what about the press and the U.S.
   population? Stange indeed that this one slipped between the cracks for
   so long... twice!

   @Nelson, that's an interesting way to look at it. I have to go back
   through the history more and see what, if any, response the news of
   Mississippi's 1995 got in Washington, D.C.

   So tell me, are they now going to enforce the law and free all those
   slaves working the night shift in the casino?

   This kind of story is a good relativistic anecdote to the greater
   story, or question, of why racism truly exist, which no one, especially
   in mainstream media, is willing to answer.

   "Black folks don't have a problem. White folks got a problem!....Black
   folks problem is that white folks got a problem"! That problem is white
   supremacy. -- Opening line from "Hidden Colors II"

   Racism,religious differences,and all the other crap that causes jock
   itch is derived from a need to feel superior i.e. making God in our
   image, Calling Muslims heathens, laying claim to knowledge that we
   stole from other civilizations and going to war over straight versus
   gay(I know its not a versus situation but do they?)

   To expect low flying birds to overcome the peaks is asking a lot. So we
   pardon them their ignorance as we admire our own intellect and
   compassion.

   People still hiding their crimes and get things their own way,
   regardless of the advancements made toward equality.

   Racial equality is still debated, but it should not take so long. We
   know people still feel privilege and superior, but the law is not
   behind them.

   They try to keep things unbalanced in their favor, but laws are
   supposed to be equal for all. Race is the most glaring. Authoritarians
   trying to keep it.

   We should not have had any of these road blocks. We still have the
   issues and people trying to deny and protect their privilege.

   There are still people trying to block this kind of progress. I applaud
   the progress, but it took how long to get this far? People are still
   trying to get up that mountain.

   Wait a second. Does this mean that the paperwork for the State of
   Mississippi to ratify the 13th Amendment of the United States was lost
   in the mail?!?!?

   Next time, hire a courier!
