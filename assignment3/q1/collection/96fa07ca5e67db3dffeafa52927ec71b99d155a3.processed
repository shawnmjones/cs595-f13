   Each Saturday, this feature links and excerpts commentary and reporting
   from a dozen progressive state blogs in the past seven days around the
    nation. The idea is not only to spotlight specific issues but to give
    readers who may not know their state has a progressive blog or two a
     place to become regularly informed about doings in their back yard.
   Just as states with progressive lawmakers and activists have themselves
   initiated innovative programs over a wide range of issues, state-based
      progressive blogs have helped provide us with a point of view and
   inside information we don't get from the traditional media. Those blogs
    deserve a larger audience. Let me know via comments or Kosmail if you
     have a favorite you think I should know about. Standard disclaimer:
     Inclusion of a diary does not necessarily indicate my agreement or
                        endorsement of its contents.

   At [29]Texas Kaos, Libby Shaw takes a dig at [30]The Texas Taliban:
   Hard at work in Washington D.C. and Austin:

     The Republican Texas Taliban are hard at work doing what they do
     best.  They continue to ignore the interests and needs of their
     constituents while they

     kowtow to the 1% of billionaires, millionaires, lobbyists and their
     crony donors.  In the case of Ted Cruz, he sucks up to the NRA and
     the gun lobby but he is also is driven by his anti-government right
     wing extremism.

     The junior Senator from the once great of Texas, Ted Cruz is
     apparently at war with his own Party.  He called his colleagues
     squishes for having the nerve stand by their constituents' desires
     for more gun control in this country.

     You didn't win Mr. Cruz. The NRA and the gun lobby did because of
     sock puppets like you.

   At [31]West Virginia Blue, PubliusWV writes [32]AG Morrisey: This Out
   of Stater Using West Virginians for Personal Gain Getting Old Fast:

     West Virginia's current Attorney General is not one of us.  He came
     to our state with a load of out of state cash and got himself
     elected.  His ambition obviously takes him back out of the state,
     probably a run for Congress.  That is all sour enough but the fact
     that Morrisey is so willing to disabuse the people of West Virginia
     on his personal path to fame and glory is too much to stomach.

     His entire time in office so far has been spent doing pretty much
     everything but representing the state of WV as our Attorney General.
      He will gut the office of consumer protection before it is over and
     bring in his out of state cronies at six figures so he can keep from
     having to deal with people from WV as much as possible.

     An example of Morrisey's lack of care for the people of WV, speaking
     of today's Medicaid expansion decision in West Virginia, Morrisey
     would have had us believe that West Virginia should have left
     166,000 of our own without health care coverage.  He would have had
     us believe that we should have turned down the thousands and
     thousands of WV jobs generated by all the additional funding.  He
     would have had us believe that given his superior birth, coming from
     outside of our poor state, he knows best.

   At [33]KnoxViews of Tennessee, R Neal shouts [34]Hey all you dumbasses
   on the Interstate:

     Reduced visibility in a rainstorm + longer stopping distance on wet
     pavement = you need to drive slower and more carefully, not faster
     and more stupid. Did you not attend your high school physics
     classes? Mass, velocity, friction, etc. Ring any bells? Driver's ed?
     Anybody?

     Plus, would it kill you to turn on your lights in the rain? It's the
     law in the states we drove through today. Maybe you like being
     invisible but it doesn't make you invulnerable. Especially at 80 MPH
     on my left or at 40MPH in front of me in pouring rain.

   At [35]Raging Chicken Press of Pennsylvania, Sean Kitchen writes
   [36]Facts be Damned, Governor Corbett's Apologists Come to Defend the
   Governor's "Drug Epidemic" Statement:

     After Governor Corbett's drug use statement that scapegoats the
     unemployed in our Commonwealth, the governor's henchmen are coming
     out in full force to back up this misinformed claim.  As you already
     know, Governor Corbett went on the PAMatters.com radio program
     earlier this week and said:

     The other area is, there are many employers that say we're looking
     for people but we can't find anybody that has passed a drug test, a
     lot of them. And that's a concern for me because we're having a
     serious problem with that.

     And now, Corbett's [DEL: campaign donors :DEL] apologists are coming
     out of the woodwork to support these factually incorrect claims.
     First up on the list is an editorial, "Guilty of Honesty"  from
     PhillyBurbs.com who agrees with Governor Corbett.

   At [37]My Left Nutmeg of Connecticut, ctblogger writes [38]Are Top
   State Education Officials trying to circumvent CT FOI law by using
   personal email accounts?

     Yet another source has confirmed that certain high-ranking officials
     in the State Department of Education are using their personal
     computers, personal email accounts or texting on their personal
     phones to conduct state business.

     Unfortunately from time to time, government officials have tried to
     side-step Connecticut's Freedom of Information laws by using their
     personal computers or personal email accounts to conduct the
     public's businesses. Others have used their personal phones to text
     information that deals with public issues.

     In all those situations, when the necessary evidence has been
     provided, the Freedom of Information Commission has been absolutely
     clear. Public records are public, even if officials use their
     private computers or phones.

     The problem is that most Freedom of Information requests only seek
     copies of emails that have been sent via state accounts. Without
     evidence, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for the Freedom
     of Information Commission to know when public officials are using
     their private accounts to conduct public business.

   At [39]Green Mountain Daily of Vermont, jvwalt opines [40]The
   Republicans' Best Friend:

     If Lenore Broughton had actually hired a smart political operative
     to run her Big Bucks Bonfire, Vermonters First, the op's first move
     would be to start sending camera crews to Governor Shumlin's news
     conferences.

     Because the Governor is making the conservative anti-tax argument as
     well as, or better than, any Vermont Republican in sight. Can't you
     just see the 2014 Vermonters First attack ads, with Shumlin railing
     against Legislative Democrats for trying to "raise every single
     broad-based tax in Vermont," aiming to "stall our economic
     recovery," and "asking Vermonters to pay more taxes than they need
     to pay"? (Quotes are all from last Thursday's presser.)

     Great stuff. It oughta be far more effective than the warmed-over
     Tea party crapola that wasted a million bucks of Broughton's
     inheritance in 2012.

   At [41]BlueOregon, Chuck Sheketoff writes about [42]The Misguided
   "Small Business Tax Cut":

     The desire to help small business owners is understandable, as they
     are an important component of our economy and communities. However,
     the granting of preferential tax treatment for people reporting
     "business income," as some lawmakers are considering under a banner
     of "helping small business," is a terribly misguided idea.

     Neither of the two arguments for cutting taxes on income derived
     from owning a business -- spurring job creation and improving
     affordability of capital -- stands up to scrutiny.

     Lowering tax rates for income derived from business will not create
     jobs. Why? For one, the tax savings are far too little to pay for a
     new employee.

   At [43]NorthDecoder, Chet asks [44]How Awful Is It To Work For Kevin
   Cramer?:

     Lesson Number One for political public relations professionals is
     that if you have bad news, release it on Friday afternoon, after
     it's too late for the press to do anything with it.  By monday, the
     morons in the media will have either missed it in the Friday
     afternoon bad-news dump, or they will not have recognized the
     significance.  Here's one that's been missed by North Dakota's crack
     squad of investigative local news losers: North Dakota Congressman
     Kevin Cramer is losing staff left and right. He issued a
     positive-sounding press release late on Friday of last week. His
     announcement was that he had lost key Washington D.C. staff. But he
     didn't put it that way. [...]

     If you were a skilled journalist in Bismarck or in Washington, when
     you got that press release last Friday, wouldn't you have been a
     little curious as to why Cramer is losing his staff so quickly?
     Shouldn't someone be asking questions?

   At [45]SquareState of Colorado, Jason Salzman reveals that a
   [46]Columnist can't cite evidence to support assertion that
   election-day registration favors Dems:

     In The Denver Post over the weekend, former State Senate President
     John Andrews wrote that if Colorado has election-day voter
     registration, as proposed in the election-modernization bill winding
     its way through the State Legislature, Democrats would "presto" have
     "tilted the electoral playing field permanently their way.
     Republican chances for regaining power and repealing any of this
     stuff will fade."

     Presto? As in presto-change-o? [...]

     How is same-day registration going to change elections in favor of
     Democrats? Experts who've studied the topic, even a guy like Curtis
     Gans who's been associated with right-leaning institutions, agree
     that same-day registration doesn't favor one party over the other.
     And they say fraud is not a problem in a place like Colorado.

   At [47]Calitics of California, Brian Leubitz writes [48]Sen. Boxer
   Pushes to Label GMOs:

     California's food labeling measure, Prop 37, was defeated by less
     than two points (51.4-48.6) last year, and that's with a mountain of
     industry cash against a small group of determined activists.
     California would have been a launching ground for the labeling of
     genetically modified food, But with an issue like food, maybe it is
     better to bring at the national level.

     And that's just what Senator Boxer is doing with the Genetically
     Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act. Along with a strong bipartisan
     coalition, including such interesting inclusions as Sens. Lisa
     Murkowski(R-AK), Jon Tester (D-MT), Rep. Don Young (R-AK), and a
     slew of progressive Congress members.

     According to surveys, more than 90 percent of Americans support the
     labeling of genetically engineered foods. That is until a campaign
     comes along, dumps a bunch of cash into confusion, and suddenly
     things change. That being said, many consumers are surprised to
     learn that GE foods are not already labeled.

   At [49]Blue Virginia, lowkell writes [50]Will Cuccinelli Emerge from
   Bunker to Appear in Court Tomorrow?

     Aside from his "no cameras or recorders" Friday afternoon media
     availability last week, at which the candidate admitted to thousands
     of dollars in unreported Star Scientific gifts, the Cuccinelli
     campaign has gone to great lengths to keep their candidate from
     explaining his ethical lapses to Virginians.

     That hide and seek approach raises the question of whether
     Cuccinelli will step into public tomorrow at 2:00pm to argue his
     motion to recuse himself from the embezzlement trial of former
     Governor's mansion chef Todd Schneider in Richmond Circuit Court.

     Ken Cuccinelli won't resign because he says he made a promise to be
     Attorney General for 4 years. Will he be bothered to be the Attorney
     General tomorrow in court when the time comes to explain why he
     can't be the Attorney General in Todd Schneider's embezzlement case?

   At [51]Appalachian Voices, Davis Wax reported that a [52]Rushed
   Anti-Renewable Energy Bill Stalls In Committee:

     A bill in the N.C. House that would repeal the state's Renewable
     Energy Portfolio Standard (REPS) failed today in the House Committee
     on Public Utilities and Energy by a vote of 18-13. [...]

     The bill was expected to fail in the committee. In the two months
     since its introduction, it has become apparent to lawmakers and the
     public that the legislation was grounded in the flawed findings of
     think tanks including the John Locke Foundation that the renewable
     portfolio standards are costing North Carolinians by raising the
     cost of electricity.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [69]Civil
   Rights, [70]Community, [71]Congress, [72]Culture, [73]Economy,
   [74]Education, [75]Elections, [76]Energy, [77]Environment, [78]Health
   Care, [79]International, [80]Labor, [81]Law, [82]Media, [83]Meta,
   [84]National Security, [85]Science, [86]Transportation, or [87]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([88]California, [89]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   on driving in the rain on the Interstate, how many schools still have
   physics and Driver's Ed classes?

   When I was in school in the '70s, my very good public schools offered
   those classes, but physics was an elective for those who planned on
   majoring in science in college, and who had already passed earth
   science, biology, and chemistry, and trigonometry and other higher math
   classes. Driver's Ed was only offered to those who paid extra for it.

   My kids graduated in the 2000's and didn't have either even offered.
   Too much time spent on standardized testing for that. Driver's Ed has
   become an out-of-school activity now, with private instructors teaching
   those classes off campus.

       Although road experience is not part of the class you can get on
       road instruction through the school system at some fee.  ALthough
       when I went to school in the 70's my cchool did not have driver's
       Ed.  We have chosen to do our own kids' on road experiential
       training.  IN PA, they are required to have 60 hours - I made my
       son and now make my daughter log in every hour.  My daughter knows
       that I won't sign off on the license unless she shows me the log
       accounting for all the hours.  It is what I did with my son.  He
       was helped out by a couple of long road trips for college visits.

   I can understand why nobody would want to pay attention to the train
   wreck happening here, but in the spirit of communications, here's some
   of our news.

   1.  [201]I'm running for governor.

   2.  [202]Nipples will soon be illegal within our borders.

   3.  Not satisfied with being a joke here, Deputy Assistant Governor
   McCrory[203]takes his comedy routine to the national stage.

   You also might want to check of BlueNC TV, [204]where some of our
   videos have been seen more than 7000 times!

   And finally, no matter how bad it gets in your state, just remember:

 From Colorado Jason Salzman takes it easy on.. ([224]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [225]dadoodaman

   .. former State Senate President John Andrews

   And I'm wondering if this focus actually helps the republicans with
   their con job in some ways.

   [226]Columnist can't cite evidence to support assertion that
   election-day registration favors Dems:

     So, I asked Andrews, your view is based on your experience here in
     Colorado?

     Yes, he said, along with his trust in Secretary of State Scott
     Gessler and former State Sen. Mark Hillman, who share Andrews'
     "alarm."

     If you talk to Andrews repeatedly, as I have over the years, you
     know that he usually takes a conversation about a slice of public
     policy, like election-day registration, and broadens it to
     discussion about human motivations or political philosophy. It's
     fun, but sometimes it scares you.

     In this case, Andrews said he doesn't think Colorado should go to
     "great lengths to turn everybody out to vote."

     "People who demonstrate what economists call 'rational ignorance,' I
     don't want those people voting," he said.

     "I'm a believer that voting should be more deliberative."

     Democrats, he said, are more inclined to be "emotional" about a
     political campaign or "snowed by an ad campaign," while Republicans,
     he says are more "fact-based."

     Thus he believes election-day registration favors Democrats, and my
     point that there no evidence to support his position didn't seem to
     bother Andrews at all.

   Because it's been well documented that [227]Scott Gessler doesn't
   believe that everyone has the right to vote - [228]not really.

   So refuting whether early voting helps Dems is actually kind of giving
   a pass to the voter supressors Scott Gesslers/Andrews.
    It allows the story to be about early voting and whether it favors
   Dems over republicans.

   It's not about favoring it's about hurting imo.

   The larger story is that cutting out early voting is just one of many
   tactics to disenfranchise certain voters - Dems - and more often than
   not that means minorities.

   Otoh: Jason Salzman is responding to an absurd unproven assertion [lie]
   by Andrews and may have covered voter suppression already in other
   stories, and I'm only seeing one small piece of his work today.

   I've been learning bit-by-bit to recognize trends in the way things are
   framed that overlook and even aid the conservative agenda, even when
   that is NOT the intent.

   Nice weekly round-up MB
