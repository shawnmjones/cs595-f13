   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [59]Tagging tips - [60]Search For Tags - [61]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [62]Civil
   Rights, [63]Community, [64]Congress, [65]Culture, [66]Economy,
   [67]Education, [68]Elections, [69]Energy, [70]Environment, [71]Health
   Care, [72]International, [73]Labor, [74]Law, [75]Media, [76]Meta,
   [77]National Security, [78]Science, [79]Transportation, or [80]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([81]California, [82]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       You have a greater chance of being killed by your neighbor than you
       do a terrorist.

       an MIT police officer, and all the others whose lives have been
       shattered by these pieces of garbage.

   Once something like that happens, so much better to apprehend the

   it's appropriate to rejoice over this ending without further deaths or
   injuries.

   Contrary to what some people believe the human heart can do more than
   one thing at a time. It can feel joy and sadness and relief all at the
   same time.  That's why we even have a word for it: bittersweet.

   The end of WW2 was bittersweet for the families who had lost sons.  The
   end of this phase of the aftermath of the Marathon Bombing is
   bittersweet, which does not in any way discount importance of the dead,
   the maimed and the injured.

   We did not want any of this to happen, but given that it did happen,
   this day finished exactly as we hoped it would: with the suspect in
   custody and the city at peace.  So let us rejoice WHILE we remember
   what has been lost.

   "a" gunshot wound and loss of blood. Not sure of the ultimate severity.

   If it's only one wound, it is almost surely from the overnight fight --
   unless the blood trail he left was his brother's blood for some reason.

   (Brother had a major trunk wound which led to blood loss which led to
   his cardiac arrest and death -- so it's possible he detonated his IED
   vest and it was so poorly designed he only succeeded in damaging
   himself.)

 OK, but the original purpose of Homeland Security ([1025]0+ / 0-)

   was to provide an umbrella authority that provided some organizational
   framework to facilitate coordination between the various law
   enforcement agencies.  I wouldn't be so quick to proclaim that it's
   done zero good over the years.  I recall many news stories about plots
   that have been thwarted.  Maybe they wouldn't have been thwarted if not
   for coordination between the agencies, coordination that did not exist
   before Homeland Security.

       of organizations did a fine job today, from all appearances.
       That doesn't mean that suddenly all types of abuses we see from a
       minority of police should go away - people can cheer the better
       actions and jeer the worse ones.
       This is a cheering moment.

   while you praise the good eggs.  Unless you think they're all bad
   apples. I just don't happen to share that opinion.

   It was a commendable effort. For all those who like to point out the
   incompetentcy of government, this should at least be an exception to
   your usual rants.  They communicated, they coordinated, they did their
   best to stomp out the misleading stories, they did what they thought
   was best to protect their citizens and they eventually accomplished the
   desired end.

   No, it won't be the last time we experience terrorism. But all you can
   do is fight back when it happens, and do it as smartly and tenaciously
   as possible.

       It's not like "lawyering up" is going to do him any good, many in

   I think this guy is almost certainly guilty of terrorist offenses.  I
   expect that he'll face the death penalty, and it will be a very
   interesting trial.  The outcome will depend on the role his elder
   brother played in his life.

   But that's why we have a judiciary.  No two cases are the same, and the

   that's what the right to not self-incriminate means.  And, yes, that's

       It's a process (as in due process), not a result. If the government
       can't present enough actual evidence that 1) a crime was committed
       and 2) the accused is the one who committed it, then demands for
       "Justice" are just the ranting of a mob. A fair trial still

   From the profile of Ali Soufan, FBI investigator who did a a lot of
   work on the USS Cole bombings and 9/11 attacks:

   "[Soufan] was tasked with the "intensive interrogation" of Abu Jandal
   over the course of five days in Yemen, during which time Jandal gave up
   the names of a number of members of al-Qaeda.[7]
   It was his questioning of Mohammed al Qahtani, that led to the
   terrorism charges against Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri in Chicago, whom al
   Qahtani had mentioned being a relative.[5]"

       The great thing about using techniques other than torture is that
       not only are they right, they work better.
       Soufan's book ([2650]http://www.amazon.com/...) is hilarious in
       places as he describes the mind games they would use on
       interrogation subjects, basically using what the investigators
       already knew to appear omniscient. Or convince the subject that the
       guys he's protecting aren't worth it (exploiting a rift between one
       guy and bin Laden that the FBI was aware of, for instance). After a

   Mass doesn't have he death penalty,,,,the federal gov does, right?

   He is 19 years old...  What horror he caused for many people,  did he
   really know what he was doing?   And he has lived a life of horror ever
   since...and will never escape from his stupid action on marathon day.

   May everyone involved eventually find some kind of peace.

 SuperMax ([4454]0+ / 0-)
       [4455]SuperMax.
       One of my cousins decided to plead guilty to espionage several
       years ago (they caught him giving radio calls to the Soviet Union
       if that tells you how long ago this happened), and they dropped him
       in SuperMax for several years. In the last few years, he was
       transferred to Leavenworth.  To say he is estranged from the family
       is something of an understatement.
       Whether or not this young man would have contact with other inmates
       would depend largely on the other inmates at his security level.
       They are allowed contact with one another, but most of those
       incarcerated in the tightest levels, such as Zacarias Moussaoui and
       Theodore Kaczynski, despise one another and refuse to converse.
       In 2009, we spent the night in Florence, CO.  It's an interesting
       community.  The motel we stayed in was the closest one to the
       prison, and you could stand in the parking lot and watch guard
       changes & yard time.  The rooms had doors, but there were no
       closets, and the bathrooms didn't have doors.

       tighter and tolerance for misbehaviour is lower. I'm not talking

       I assume that solitary confinement is legal in the US, because we
       have had it for years, and I assume that the SCOTUS has not ruled
       that solitary confinement constitutes "cruel and unusual
       punishment", and so doesn't violate the 5th amendment or the US
       Constitution in general.
       But progressive civil libertarians maintain that solitary
       confinement is torture, and so does violate international law and
       moral sensibilities.  So I would think that the progressive civil
       libertarian position would be that everyone, including the likes of
       bin laden and the unibomber, be placed in the general population
       when serving time in prison.
       Or is it in keeping with progressive civil libertarian thought to
       make exceptions?  I don't think one can proclaim solitary to be
       torture on one hand, then make exceptions on the other (unless one
       concedes that it's OK to torture some people (via solitary) but not
       others).
       Personally, I really don't care whether this guy gets solitary or
       not, and I do recognize that life would be easier for him in
       solitary than in the general population (though I admit that making
       life easier for him isn't exactly at the top of my list of
       priorities).  But I would think that whether to put him in solitary
       or not might present a moral dilemma for staunch progressive civil
       libertarians.

     Or is it in keeping with progressive civil libertarian thought to
     make exceptions?
       That's roughly my position. I don't think that many people would,
       or should, qualify. 400 or so (again out of > 2M) sounds about
       right to me. For the rest of them, it shouldn't be much of an
       issue.
       A different hypothetical....imagine Adolf Hitler himself, in jail.
       How can you allow him any chance at all to influence the other
       inmates? And how can you just let him be vulnerable to physical
       attack? So, in my mind, the availability of social interaction
       isn't the only important consideration. The social needs of the
       inmate need to be balanced with both of those other concerns.

   It's weird for me.

   I grew up in the midwest and everyone here in New England tells me that
   I have an accent.

   Yet I don't really hear their accent any more. Unless it's deliberately
   exaggerated. That's wicked weahd.

   But I can speak New Hampshire like a native!

   When they first moved in to surround the boat, the commanding officer
   called out to verify position of a TAC team and while the guy was
   answering something like "confirmed, we have eyes on the suspect from
   the fence side" or something...

   ... you overheard another officer behind him say, in complete deadpan,

   Out of interest in just how bad CNN has become, I switched back and
   forth between CNN and MSNBC. CNN still had the suspect in a "structure"
   a good 5 minutes after MSNBC not only had him in a boat, but had
   pictures of the boat. The capture was announced on MSNBC a few minutes
   ahead of the "great" CNN as well. It used to be such a good network -
   but that was more than a decade ago.

   page correctly that the FBI looked into Tsarnaev at the request of
   another country and closed the file? Did that really happen? If so,
   this needs to be looked into.

   Congrats to the FBI, state and local authorities and Governor Patrick
   for getting this done so quickly. I am relieved for the people of

   ... but that's all these two brothers ever were: common criminals.

   Ditto the 9/11 hijackers and murderers.  Had they survived their
   suicide/homicide actions, they'd have been charged with almost three
   thousand murders, hijacking four planes, property damage for blowing up
   buildings and planes.

   The 9/11 hijackers used low-tech weapons to create maximum damage which
   is what these particular kind of common criminals do.

   Calling them "terrorists" is giving them too much credit unless you buy
   into the fear of the criminal minority they are trying to create.

   They speak for no one but themselves, have no authority to speak on
   behalf of any country or any country's military.

   STOP giving these common criminals more power and more credit than they

       I get so damned tired of hearing the word "terrorist" and "terror"
       and "terrorized" I could scream.
       I was never afraid after 9/11, still am not afraid.
       Disgusted, contemptuous of the criminals who committed such heinous
       acts for no discernible reason, but I don't feel the least bit
       "terrorized."  Heck, I'm more afraid of the texters and people who
       drive down the road talking on phones and drunk drivers than I am
       of criminals!
       Perspective.  It's all about putting criminals into perspective in
       the grand scheme of things.
       There are more good people than criminals.  Why are our government
       officials and Moronic Media trying to brainwash us into feeling
       "terrified"?????????
       What's in it for our political wannabe dictators - other than being
       able to con us into letting them refuse to give us back our rights
       that should never have been taken away from us in the first place
       with the Patriot Act, MCA '06, FISA fiasco '08, and MCA '09...?
       We STILL do not have our rights back, including habeas corpus,
       BTW....
       I'm sick of attempts to steer this nation from principles evolved
       in The Age of Reason to hallucinations derived from illiterate
       herdsmen. ~ Crashing Vor

       if a habitat is flooded, the improvement for target fishes

   instead of sending in the Army when we want to catch terrorists. Cops
   have the training and the experience in manhunts. Troops are trained to
   fight, not to catch people on the run.

   Act now, please?

       I was trained to kill people, not investigate and apprehend them.
       I don't know the first fucking thing about that.  Soldiers are
       warriors.  Policemen should be, and used to be, public servants
       dedicated to keeping the peace.  The blurring of that division is
       dangerous in my opinion.
