   Daily Kos Radio's Kagro in the Morning show podcasts are now available
   through iTunes.

   We're limping through the tech problems, but we're getting there. The
   Netroots Radio staff effected an emergency evacuation from their old
   servers in order to get us back on the air ASAP, and at least the
   direct download link for the stream (below) will get you the live show.
   So, I understand, will the Stitcher player. Less clear is how long it
   will take other live streams like iTunes, Tune In and others, to catch
   up with our new URL.

   But you can always find us at NetrootsRadio.com. That's for sure.

   We've got a truckload of new stories. And oh yeah, all the ones I
   forgot to get to yesterday. Like Cory Booker, the jerk at AOL, Noam
   Chomsky, and Google.

   We'll see what comes up in the course of the early morning to distract
   me from those things again.

   We're LIVE at 9 a.m. ET with Kagro in the Morning, thanks to
   NetrootsRadio.com.

     Listen LIVE here:The Daily Kos Radio Player

     [EMBED]

     [29]Can't see the Flash player? Click here to download the stream
     directly.

   Or if you prefer, why not [30]download the Stitcher app on your
   favorite mobile device, and search for the Netroots Radio live stream?
   And hey, when you do, be sure to sign up with the promo code DAILYKOS,
   and earn Daily Kos Radio $1 in the Stitcher affiliate program!

   Please do remember to "favorite" us while you're at Stitcher. We're
   bouncing up and down in the rankings these days, and the more of you
   who help us, the more listeners out there who'll find us on the
   Stitcher network.

   Miss the last show? You can catch it here:

   width/540/theme/legacy/direction/no/autoplay/no/autonext/no/thumbnail/y
   es/preload/no/no_addthis/no/

   Need more info on how to listen? Find it below the fold.

   We've been having some chronic problems with the phone-in system, and
   it's rightly pointed out that if we can't deliver on the promise, we
   shouldn't hold out the offer.

   I'll see what we can do to get the tech straightened out so that we can
   open the doors again, soon!

   Ways to Listen to Kagro in the Morning:

   Your options to listen LIVE:
     * Click on the embedded Flash player above
     * Go to netrootsradio.com and click on the embedded player or direct
       link there
     * Click on [32]this direct link if you need a non-Flash player, say,
       for iPad or iPhone
     * iPad and iPhone users can download the SHOUTCast Radio app for your
       mobile device & search for "Netroots Radio"
     * Download the [33]Stitcher app and search for "Netroots Radio" to
       find the live stream there. (Don't forget to use the DAILYKOS promo
       code when you sign up!)
     * On iTunes, find Netroots Radio under Radio>News/Talk Radio
     * For Android: try either the "StreamFurious"  or "TuneIn" apps
     * BlackBerry users, see [34]this guide by idbecrazyif

   And here's a new tip: If the player hiccups or drops the audio between
   the shows, just go ahead and stop and restart it, and things should go
   smoothly after that.

   If you miss the show, or just can't listen live, you can:
     * find podcasts on the [35]Daily Kos Radio group page
     * find individual podcasts, or subscribe to the feed (free!) via
       iTunes
     * download them [36]via RSS
     * find them on demand at [37]Stitcher.com

   Things you can do to help us grow:
     * [38]download the Stitcher app on your phone, search for the show,
       "favorite" it and help us rise in their rankings and take over the
       world
     * [39]like us on Facebook
     * follow [40]@DailyKosRadio on Twitter
     * Feel free to download the show, edit and post your favorite clips
       for sharing via social media

   Thanks for all your support, and enjoy the show!

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [53]Tagging tips - [54]Search For Tags - [55]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

 David, Jeff Zucker gets a duel benefit by ([117]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [118]justiceputnam

   investing in Waywire.  He can make a donation to Cory Booker in a way
   that avoids many, if not all, campaign finance regulations.  In
   addition, he gets his 15 year old son a part time job.  I'm sure his
   son gets paid something for his advisory role.

   I'm sure he gets paid more than he'd make mowing lawns or God forbid
   working at McDonald's.

   As a bonus he gets to hang out with Oprah a couple times a year at a
   board meeting.

 You said just about the same thing. I was just ([125]0+ / 0-)
       emphasizing the part time job for his teenage son aspect of it all.
        In these days when the average McDonald's worker is 28 and trying
       to make it working full time for a minimum wage that isn't even
       enough to make it out of poverty, this fifteen year old is probably
       better paid for what amounts to a part time job at a company his
       Daddy invested in for political reasons.
       Also, I'm sure the only reason Zucker felt the need to address the
       issue at all is because it feeds into the Republican narrative that
       NBC and CNN are biased toward Hilary Clinton and other Democrats.
       Zucker has worked at both CNN and NBC.  It should be noted however
       that Zucker spent most of his time at NBC working for Jack Welch,
       who is no fan of Democrats and took great delight in co-opting so
       called "liberal journalists" like Tim Russert and Chris Matthews by
       offering them fat TV contracts.
