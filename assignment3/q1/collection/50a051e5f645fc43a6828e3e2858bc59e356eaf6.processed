[24]Rubio still backtracking on abortion

   U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL). REUTERS/Jason Reed
   Marco Rubio, confused
   A week ago, the Weekly Standard [30]announced that Sen. Marco Rubio
   would be introducing an anti-abortion bill after the Fourth of July
   holiday. Conservatives rejoiced, because nothing gets them as excited
   as fighting a doomed battle with zero chance of success.

   And then a funny thing happened. The holiday came and went and
   conservatives eager to see Rubio groveling for their forgiveness (after
   that whole unpleasant "immigration" thing) are still waiting.
   [31]Yesterday, Rubio's people were like "abortion what? Huh?"

   And [32]today, they're still trying to figure out how to drag
   themselves out of that mess.

     Sen. Marco Rubio is "very supportive" of the effort to introduce a
     bill banning abortion after 20 weeks, and is working with other
     senators on the bill, he told POLITICO.

     The Florida Republican wouldn't say whether he will be a lead
     sponsor of the proposed legislation.

   So we've gone from "Rubio will propose ban" to "he kinda supports it,
   but can't say whether he'll sponsor it." Hmmm, maybe he's starting to
   realize that abortion politics no longer help Republicans and that
   quite to the contrary, it merely reinforces their "war on women"
   proclivities? For someone with presidential ambitions, this does put
   him in a serious bind.

   But don't worry, crazies, because he's still got this!

     Rubio noted his co-sponsorship of a bill to ban abortions after 20
     weeks in the District of Columbia written by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah)
     as evidence that it's an effort he is very much behind.

   ... because, you know, nothing says "Republicans are all about states
   rights" than Republicans fighting to impose their regressive morality
   on places that don't want it.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [50]Tagging tips - [51]Search For Tags - [52]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Rubio is such a coward, he's all in favor of banning abortion after 20
   weeks in DC where he doesn't have to run for re-election.

   Have some guts, Marco. Make an all out push in favor of a nationwide

 You have feet of clay, Sen. Rubio, with no steel ([250]0+ / 0-)

   ... anywhere near your backbone as of now.

   The Republican Party desperately needs a leader, a young voice with a
   manners and a good stage presence, with proven electability.

   Oh Yes, and reasonable positions. If you don't broaden your appeal to
   voters, those other things about you won't count. Mitt Romney tried to
   have it both ways - far out and toadying to the Extreme right during
   primary season and moderate in the debates. It. Did. Not. Work.

   And it won't work for you. Your choice.
