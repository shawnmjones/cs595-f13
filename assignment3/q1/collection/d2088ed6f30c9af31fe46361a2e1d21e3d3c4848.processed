[24]David Gregory almost got it right

   U.S. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) speaks during a news conference
   on Capitol Hill in Washington, November 28, 2012. Boehner voiced
   optimism that Republicans could broker a deal with the White House to
   avoid year-end austerity measures, saying on Wedn
   "Sometimes, even I believe my lies."
   During Speaker of the House John Boehner's Sunday appearance on Meet
   the Press, host David Gregory did a fairly good job of holding
   Boehner's feet to the fire and challenging some of his more obvious
   misstatements ... but Gregory did miss the boat on [30]this one:

     SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER: Now listen, we've known about this for 16
     months. And yet even today, there's no plan from Senate Democrats or
     the White House to replace the sequester. And over the last 10
     months, House Republicans have acted twice to replace the sequester.
     There are smarter ways to cut spending than these automatic across
     the board...

     DAVID GREGORY: But Mr. Speaker that's just not true. They've made it
     very clearly, as the president just did, that he has a plan that
     he's put forward that involves entitlement cuts, that involves
     spending cuts, that you've made a choice as have Republicans to
     leave tax loopholes in place. And you'd rather have those and live
     with all these arbitrary cuts...
     (OVERTALK)

     SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER: Well, David that's just nonsense. If he had a
     plan, why wouldn't Senate Democrats go ahead and pass it?

   Gregory pivoted to tax revenues at that point, missing the very obvious
   response: Senate Democrats did vote for a plan. But Senate Republicans
   [31]filibustered it. Just as they've filibustered every major piece of
   legislation that's come down the pike over the past four years.

   So close, Mr. Gregory, so close.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   And it's why I believe that Boner is incompetent.
   And the worst part is that he's one of the smarter, better skilled
   Republicans in the House, it's downhill from him.
   They don't know that it's their job and if they did, they don't know
   how to do their job.
   They put Paul Ryan in charge of writing the budget!
   And the document he came up with isn't even funny. The first time, it
   was a "budget" without numbers! The second time, it had a few numbers
   but they didn't add up and when the CBO tried to score it, it was worse
   than useless. These guys are the underwear gnomes.

   This is all theater.  Obama and Reid want to cut entitlements but want
   to try and blame the GOP for it.

   Boehner is right - Senate Dems didn't pass any bill.  They could have
   if they reformed the filibuster but the Senate Dems and Senate Dems
   alone didn't want that responsibility so kept the filibuster to allow
   the GOP to block them, so "we have no choice but to compromise with the
   evil GOP".

       I see this said from time to time but what I don't see is why?
       What would possibly be the motivation for Barack Obama and
       Congressional Dems to keep the status quo and have some devious
       plan in place to "cut entitlements".  I see no real benefit
       whatsoever to 1. Their personal finances or 2. To their future
       power.  If this corporatist conspiracy you infer existed, why even
       pretend?  The theft could have easily occurred without all the
       drama the day he roared into office.  They could have just let the
       country fall into depression, no push for health care reform, no
       auto bailout, no jobs bill push, no liberal Supreme Court
       nominations, no draw down of troops, and the pieces would have been
       in place to rob all the entitlement funds, turn the country into a
       jobless wasteland, and those in power could have just sunk away
       into a comfortable lifestyle buoyed by the payoffs from their
       corporate masters.
       You know when you look at it that way, what you propose is the
       ultimate CT, a more complex plan or sleight of hand than would have
       been required for a faked moonshot.

 GOP gambling it won't be held accountable... ([229]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [230]Nadnerb in NC, [231]wintergreen8694

   by the general electorate in 2014 House and Senate races for being the
   primary factor responsible for deliberately blocking solution to
   federal budgetary problems and public service interruptions.  Thanks in
   substantial part to congressional district gerrymandering they were
   positioned to do by the 2010 elections, they got by just-enough in the
   2012 elections to insulate themselves from accountability so far, with
   an assist from the bumbling both-sides-do-it slant to media coverage.

   It remains to be seen whether the public will be prodded not merelyh
   into sufficient annoyance and attention, but for enough to make correct
   conclusions to make 2014 enough of a "wave" election for the dems to
   retake control of the house and retain control of the Senate, contrary
   to long-term trends in 6th year elections of two-term presidents.  I
   certainly hope so, but for this to happen, there's lots of political
   and media inertia that has to be overcome.  Unfortunately, so far (2010
   especially) the GOP's gamble on non-accountability for their strategy
   of total sabotage of government has paid off well enough for it to
   work.

       [259]Amid Deadlock, Obama Pins Hopes on Helping Democrats Win Back
       the House in 2014

     President Obama has long frustrated members of his own party by
     being reluctant to get involved in much of the ground game of
     Democratic political campaigns. Now things have changed and Obama is
     less concerned about the perceived independence of his political
     brand than with being able to move along legislation during his last
     years in office. Soon after his reelection victory, Obama began
     implementing plans to help Democrats win back the House in 2014,
     reports the [260]Washington Post.

     Obama will be raising money, recruiting candidates, and using his
     new nonprofit to help contenders, all in the hopes of gaining the 17
     House seats Democrats need to win back the majority they lost in
     2010. Case in point, the president has already committed to eight
     fundraisers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee this
     year, compared with two in 2009.

       expand to a 50 000 precinct strategy. Not just every state, not
       just every Congressional district, hit them on the Statehouse
       level, hit them on the City government level. There should never be
       an unopposed Republican race anywhere for any office.

 For much of my teaching career ([421]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [422]AllanTBG, [423]MrJersey, [424]WSComn

   way back when (I am retired), I used to tell my young students (middle
   school age) that "an independent press" was a key component that kept
   democracy working.  As long as our media (tv and print back then)
   remained unconnected to government/corporations we, the people, could
   find sources for speaking truth to power.

   How sad that now I feel I would, if I could, go back and warn my
   students, "do not trust the media....beware that they can be and will
   be bought and paid for by huge corporations and they will be willing to
   sell out the people to line their own pockets."

   Maybe I was naive but at one time in my young life, (during things like
   Watergate, during the protests against the draft, the fights for civil
   rights, women's rights) I believed that we, the people, had survived
   the McCarthyism of my parents' era, the Nixonian craziness and had
   moved forward in people power.  Coming of age in the 1960s, I
   protested, I was an active citizen, and I taught that way, not telling
   students what to believe but rather that being an active, informed
   participant in democracy was crucial.
   I never imagined we would go back to McCarthyism...on steroids no less.

   I cried the day Reagan was elected.  To me, that was the turning point.
    I had a sense of foreboding that something really wrong would be the
   result and for thirty years I have watched (still staying active
   myself) as the right grew in power, aided by extreme right wingers, and
   weak spineless democrats.  I fear for us all now.  I am not sure we can
   undo what started in 1980 -think Scalia.  I want to believe we can use
   social media and the web to get our the truth but the power of
   corporate media is frightening.   So many of my peers (agewise) don't
   bother challenging the media on television believing it has not changed
   that much.  And even my more centrist left leaning peers, don't quite
   want to admit that electing Reagan was a bad thing.   I cannot believe
   how many of them have bought into the Reagan mythology.  Maybe it is
   their own guilt.
    They see Brokaw and give him the same credence given to
   Cronkite...they think MTP and Face the Nation and This Week are the
   same shows they were before corporations bought out the networks. Half
   of them don't even know that the networks are now small pieces of huge
   international corporations who basically never want "the people" to
   have their democracy.

   Scary and sad....for me anyway.  Sometimes I really wonder if we can
   change this destructive path at all.  I voted for Obama and frankly, I
   don't see him as much different than Clinton.  I knew when I voted for
   Clinton he was a centrist.......but it was at least a move to the left
   a little coming off the Reagan/Bush years.   Then we the SCOTUS stole
   the 2000 election and people just accepted it,  I was stunned.   I saw
   Hillary and Barack as pretty much the same. I know, I know, Hillary was
   for Iraq but other than that they were no different and in fact, I
   think Hillary was left of Barack on some things.  But I am OK with that
   because I think we have to nudge and nudge to the left before we can
   actually elect a Bernie Sanders or an Alan Grayson.   Now, I really
   don't know.  With the help of the media, the corporate powers that give
   any and every  crazy on the right credence,  the spineless concessions
   of the left, the inability of the president or the democratic side of
   Congress to call out the craziness, to really play hardball with these
   a**hates, I wonder if we have any chance at all.

   undertax the rich, overspend on corporate welfare and defense (which

   services for the poor and middle class, and reversing this, we're
   having a fake debate--by design--between those who want to destroy the
   New Deal and those who merely want to trim it. This is all political
   theater, Kabuki, intended to push the goalposts rightward so that we
   end up with a "compromise" that isn't quite as bad as what the Repubs
   want, but still far worse than it could and should be, and we can all
   breath a sigh of relief that the republic is saved. Except it's not.

     And over the last 10 months, House Republicans have acted twice to

   Those House bills were all passed last year by the previous Congress

       is to not call Republicans on obvious lies.  If he did that, it
       would upset the big sponsors, who love it when Republicans get to
       perpetuate lies.  Plus, Boner and McTurtle might not come on his
       little show anymore, and then what would he do?  He might not even

 The Bush Tax cuts Boehner originally voted for ([557]0+ / 0-)

   also had the sunset clause.  Meaning that in 2001 Boehner and 210 other
   House Republicans, in essence, pre-approved the January 2013 "tax

   Of course, this is a purely cynical political calculation by the GOP.
   If this were 2014, they wouldn't be doing this, because of the risk of
   getting their asses handed to them in the election.  They are counting
   on the voting public to have short memories, and will inflict as much
   damage as they can right now.

   After all, as that sage of NPR, Cokie Roberts, said this morning, if

 The Senate didn't pass a bill... ([569]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [570]AllanTBG

   because Harry Reid and other Senate Democrats refused to push through
   meaningful filibuster reform.

   Because of this Bohner an can away with claiming the Senate did not
   pass a bill and not look any more of an idiot than he already is.

   By putting the onus on the Senate to come up with something he new
   exactly what he was doing; he knew very well it would never get 60
   votes.

   But let's put the ultimate responsibility for this where it belongs --
   on Reid and other Senate Dems who didn't have the sense to see this (or
   plenty of future filibusters) coming, or dedcided that this shit was
   fine with them.

   The dynamic of the sequester would have changed significantly had the
   Senate actually passed a bill. But Boehner knew that would never
   happen, so he was more than happy to keep saying "the Senate must act."

   And he can continue this little game for lots of stuff into the future
   (his bluff did get called with VAVA; notice the  dyamic there.  The
   Senate bill actually got a vote and passed in the House because a) it
   did pass the Senate filibuster nonwithstanding and b) the optics were
   so bad)

 US media, especially Cable News Channels ([591]0+ / 0-)

   almost never follow up carefully with questions/answers in an
   interview.  I watch and it is infuriating.  They let  obviously
   ridiculous and inane answers go without clarifying or confronting.
   Gregory does it all the time.  All the newsreaders and spokesmodels on
   the cable news channels do it - because - I think they are too dumb to
   understand things the way a thoughtful and informed viewer who loves
   politics understands.  Many are undereducated and have no sense of
   history or context and it is obvious they don't have a clue as to the
   subject matter they are attempting to cover.  There is one at MSNBC who
   is beyond the pae - Alec Witt (Weekends).  She is always in way over
   her head and  is simpy silly.  There are silly males also, believe me -
   Fox & Friends is a farce - with two male clowns.  Fox News Channel is a
   total disaster - a hatefest against the president and all things
   Progressive/Liberal.  I cannot watch it.

   Finally, I have noticed there are many young so-called "analysts" and
   "strategists" appearing regularly on cable news who are do not have
   adequate diction and do not speak in a sure and clear way so as to be
   understood.  Public Speaking was a universally chosen course when I
   went to college - as it truly helped everyone to present and think in a
   mindful and clear way.  Certain cable news persons slur their words and
   speak so quickly and without diction that they are unintelligible.

 I am going to say something that may not go ([594]0+ / 0-)

   over well...

   But Boehner kind of has a point. He is factually wrong, but the point
   he is making is Senate Dems haven't brought the President's plan to the
   floor for cloture (THANK GOODNESS).

   But he is right the Senate Dems know the President's plan is toxic to
   Dems and Republicans.  Toxic.

   So maybe the President should offer the Senate Dems plan, and stop
   putting entitlements on the table.

   And be careful...if you say that will make him look like the he is not
   compromising, tell me how that differs from what is being said about
   him now?

   This is the stuff or modern American politics.

   The news media, for the most part, is as much a part of the problem as
   any other institution. They rarely, if ever, elucidate, preferring to
   reduce news and information to happy-talk gossip.

   The US press is useless. All it does is parrot government information,
   with little analysis. If Gregory were asking tough questions, no one
   would come on the show. He knows that. The pols know the power they
   hold, and they all go to the same parties, have good health insurance,
   6 or 7 figure incomes, vacation in the same places and are all part of
   the ruling glass. No one is concerned in any real way with protecting
   the public by providing the needed information in a timely fashion and
   in a useful manner.

   The pols are interested in power, impact and effecting permanent change
   on this country. The press are mere acolytes. If they have any impact,
   it's purely happenstance. Speaking of Bob Woodward, see Watergate.
