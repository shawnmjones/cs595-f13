The economy and the amnesiacs

   Carly Fiorina, a Romney campaign surrogate and failed U.S. Senate
   candidate, argued a couple of weeks ago that the economic conditions
   President Obama inherited weren't that bad. By January 2009, she
   [3]said, "the recession, we now know from the data, was over."

   Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) made a [4]similar case yesterday, arguing
   that the economy was not in "free fall" when Obama took office. On the
   contrary, the far-right senator said, "President Obama's policies took
   effect ... and as a result the economy totally stalled."

   Now, admittedly, I don't expect much from [5]Johnson, but the public
   shouldn't forget what actually happened. Let's revisit [6]a post from
   June, and look at the nation's GDP before and after "President Obama's
   policies." Note, once the stimulus kicked in, the economy immediately
   started growing.

   And in this chart we see private-sector job growth before and after the
   stimulus. Note, once Obama's Recovery Act kicked in, job growth
   immediately improved. Also note how severe the job losses were when the
   president took office.

   And here's a chart showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average before and
   after the stimulus. See that low point in March 2009? That's just
   before the stimulus kicked in.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I understand the tactic Johnson and Fiorina are using. If the public
   forgets just how awful conditions were when Obama took office, voters
   will also forget how much the economy has improved on the president's
   watch. It's in the interests of assorted hacks, cranks, and amnesiacs
   to argue that Obama wasn't really dealt that bad a hand, so there's no
   reason to give him credit for getting the nation on a stronger, more
   stable track. It's why Fiorina, with a degree of shamelessness that's
   slightly unnerving, claims the recession was "over" by the time Obama
   was inaugurated.

   But for those who care at all about reality, the facts should matter.
   The crisis that began in late 2008 was the worst since the Great
   Depression. Nothing else comes close. The global economy stood on the
   brink of catastrophic collapse; then Obama took office; then his
   policies took effect; and the economy started to improve. Technically,
   the recession ended six months after Obama became president, which
   wasn't a coincidence.

   Political players can and should argue about whether those policies
   were sufficient and what the effects would have been to alternate
   approaches, but the fact that the president took the lead in rescuing
   the economy during a once-in-a-lifetime crisis is not in dispute.

   Well I don't see that I lumped all republicans into one, but
   moderate republicans are becoming scarcer and scarcer. I live in an
   area that is 70% republican and I have one in my immediate family and
   I see how they go ever farther and farther right. When Nixon now seems
   like a middle of the road president you know the GOP has shifted way
   out to the right. My mom's childhood friend in Utah, Bob Bennett, who
   always seemed like, to us, a pretty conservative guy (but not far
   right and indeed pretty moderate for a Mormon--and no half my family
   is Mormon I'm not insulting them just that most Mormons I know are
   pretty conservative) was replaced by a Tea-party extremist...the
   examples abound.

   Some of the effects can be seen in the analogous situations in Greece,
   Ireland and Spain, where instead of stimulus their governments opted
   for severe austerity measures. There are of course many differences,
   like the potential for their economies to rebound vs. the US, but for
   the sake of a "what if?" arguement, it's worth looking at.

   Watch the next-to-last scene in "The Blues Brothers", the one where the
   Illinois Nazis have driven their orange station wagon off the
   unfinished bridge and are plummeting toward the ground hundreds of feet
   below.

   THAT'S what the economy was like in January, 2009. The only question
   was how hard the crash would be when we hit bottom.

   The causes were different, but the consequences of the last time the US
   banking system was that sick FDR closed all banks for almost two weeks,
   some never re-opened, he banned private ownership of gold coin or
   bullion. We got the FDIC, Glass-Steagal, the SEC, etc. It took eight to
   ten years and World War II for the economy to recover. The Republican
   policies from October 1929 until March 1933 exported the US downturn to
   Europe, leading to the rise of Hitler and Mussolini. Nowhere anyone who
   doesn't want religious jihad and / or armegeddon wants to go to today.
   And yeah, Romney & Ryan 's economic and tax platform looks a lot like
   Hoover's.

   The short answer is yes, there are models out there of how the economy
   would have progressed (or regressed) without the stimulus. Better yet,
   there is history. Congress didn't act upon the Great Depression until
   almost 3 years after the onset (after Roosevelt's administration was
   inaugurated). It took until we entered WW II to recover.

   The problem that we, the American people, hobble our politicians with
   is that there isn't great enthusiasm for either increased taxes or
   spending cuts. So we mostly get a side show and unrealistic and

   The Stimulus package, according to Keynesian economics, was a way to
   head out of recession. However, now, since we have "recovered" it is
   imperative that we become more selective of where our government
   dollars go to see more and faster growth. A lot is being put into many
   social programs, some of which can be privately funded. We need to
   follow the lead of our Northern neighbors and cut spending on some
   social programs as hard as that may be. Only then can we return to the
   days of great prosperity.

   Wow, that's some weapons-grade bull@!$%# there. Your characterization
   of Keynesian economics is entirely incorrect -- stimulus isn't "a way
   to head out of recession," it's a way to stimulate demand when the
   economy is below capacity, in the situation when businesses aren't
   hiring because there isn't enough demand, and consumers aren't spending
   to create demand because they're worried about jobs. Sound familiar?

   The recession technically ended in June 2009 and the recovery started.
   If you think that equates to "we have recovered," then I presume you
   won't object if I take your meal away when you start eating because
   "you have eaten."

   Money is being put into social programs because the economy hasn't
   recovered and people are still unemployed or underemployed. Declaring
   that making those "privately funded" will produce more growth is either
   delusional or a cover to pretend you're not suggesting making ordinary
   people suffer more so people for whom it is not "hard" at all can keep
   their record-low tax rates. If it were actually possible to shift from
   having social programs funded by private sources at the same level
   instead of by the government, it would have no economic effect at all,
   so either you're calling for cutting social programs and cruelly making
   the poor suffer even more from the long-term effects a financial panic
   caused by rich financiers and speculators, or you're speaking economic
   nonsense.

   The article you cite says that "for the first time in recent history"
   the average Canadian is richer than the average American. If you take
   that one time as a call to do what the Canadians are doing, you're
   cherry-picking, I suspect because it tells you something you already
   like. The more sensible response to that fact is to look at the many
   other times when we were richer than Canadians as a clue to what we
   should be doing.

   That's a harmful way to recovery when it is more fair and easier just
   to bring in more revenue by getting the ultra wealthy to pay their fair
   share. Keep in mind we spent our way out of the debt incurred after
   WWII and already Obama has decreased the deficit by $300 billion since
   taking office...$200 billion in the last year alone. No other president
   in modern history has reduced the deficit and debt this fast except
   Clinton. Obama has reduced the debt by a fourth.

   Of course we should eliminate fraud and abuse wherever we find it but
   the social programs are necessary and doing fine. Cutting the war
   profiteers profits, you know...the arms dealers with their 19 bedroom
   mansions in Virginia...cutting the bloated defense budget (which far
   exceeds the total of social programs) and letting the Bush tax cuts on
   the wealthy expire is all that is needed to get rid of the debt in 10
   yrs. Leave the social programs alone except to enhance them. When the
   right refers to shrinking government they really mean getting rid of
   regulations so corporations can pollute and banks can con.

   Trillions of dollars for Tax Cut that don't result in jobs are a waste.

   A trillion dollars for a war base on fabricated lies is a waste.

   Another trillion for Med. Part D was a waste.

   Social programs did not bring America to its knees, its was the

   greed of capitolism. The biggest difference between tax cuts

   and those social programs, not much as far as who ends up paying for
   them

   we invest each week into SS and Medicare, we also pay for the fail tax
   cuts

   the top 2% save and invest off shore. Go to Canada, leave America.

   If your base is fiercely proud of its ignorance and has an open
   hostility towards learning, the scientific process and accurate
   information in general then they are extremely susceptible to any
   interpretation which satisfies their preconceived notions and
   prejudices. The Republican party has always been extremely adept at
   exploiting this to its fullest potential. Inventing some pleasant

   Steve -- You do a fine job of drawing attention to the coterie of
   citizens who choose to misrepresent reality for political gain.

   But there is another kind of amnesia going on: most Very Serious People
   in the Village are complaining that the President has no Plan. Many
   also claim that he did nothing during his first term and is trying to
   obscure that fact.

   The Minority Leader of the Senate said overtly that it was of prime
   importance not that his party assist the President in governing the
   country, but that they should do all they could to make sure that he
   was a one-term president. The dinner bash that Frank Luntz held in D.C.
   the day of the inauguration in 2009 set in place the tactics of
   "scorched-earth" intransigence that the Minority Leader would later
   overtly embrace.

   The President entered office with major plans; as it became clear no
   negotiations were possible, despite his willingness to compromise, his
   plans shrank down to those he felt he could execute. Why is Rmoney
   promising all sorts of things HE will do -- as if the country were run
   by executive fiat -- while blaming the President for what he failed to
   do? Because we indulge his willful amnesia and misrepresentation of the
   facts. The President takes responsibility for his leadership, but note
   he is not blaming the Other Side who promised they would take the
   country down before they'd give him -- and the rest of us -- a taste of
   victory. No one likes to win ugly. No one enjoys watching sausage being
   made. Making legislation has turned out to be even more noxious, so far
   too many blame the most prominent person involved for the entire mess.

   The President is not responsible for gas prices. He is not in control
   of the worldwide market for oil, or the decisions of the Chinese
   government. It is not, nor should it ever be the policy of any
   government department to see that the price of oil is low enough to
   satisfy all consumers. It is the job of government to ameliorate what
   it can, to temper negative extremes where it has the power to do so, to
   weigh the overall concerns of the nation rather than the pocketbooks of
   just those with enough money to pay for a voice in Congress. We will
   not agree with all his choices and emphases, but it is now up to us to
   judge whether he has acted in overall good faith. That is the judgment
   I have made in deciding whom I will support.

   Government is a group effort. One part of government can balance the
   others in good faith or, as we've been seeing, in self-immolating bad
   faith. The former is what the Framers envisioned; the latter is what
   Washington warned about ("factions").

   We must not forget that. We must show our own good faith and good
   sense, and make our decisions based on the preponderence of the
   evidence.

   The accepted definition of a recession, for decades, has been two
   consecutive quarters of negative GDP. According to that, the recession
   began in the fourth quarter (officially December) of 2007 and ended in
   the second quarter of 2009, the first full quarter of the Obama
   presidency. I worked at a bank during those years that marketed its own
   credit card, and we saw a lot of warning signs during the entire summer
   of 2007.

   Previous recessions that began under both Democrats and Republicans
   used the same definition.

   By comparing it to other charts (particularly Krugman's chart which

   believe that "0" on your chart happens to correspond to January '09. If
   so, the arrow, which is at April '09, would be right about at the peak

   Romney's "plan" is based on the idea that just by having The Man Who
   Knows How to Make the Economy Work in office, the Job Creators will
   instantly revive their Animal Spirits and launch a massive economic
   revival.

   It follows that, necessarily, the ecoisnomy was already back on its
   feet thanks to the dying efforts of the (Republican) Bush
   Administration, but that the inauguration of Obama the heart went out
   of the Men Who Count and we immediately went into an uncontrollable
   dive again, not to recover for half a year. And there we have
   languished for more than three years.

   This supports the "Obama has cost the country millions of jobs" theme,
   the "all you need is [DEL: Rove :DEL] Mitt" theme, and of course the
   "he made it worse" theme.

   This is why Romney don't need no steenking "plan:" Romney is the plan.
   His Republican Private-sector awesomeness is all we really need.

   First of all consumers are the "job creators". To suggest that Romney
   IS the plan is laughable.

   The Romney/Ryan economic recovery plan seems to be based essentially on
   tax cuts, with defense spending stimulus, to back them up. Reagan used
   basically the same plan in the eighties, but the global circumstances
   (and ours) were much different, and even then, he ended up almost
   tripling the national debt.

   Bush did essentially the same thing, using the housing bubble as a
   stimulus "backstop" to his earlier tax cuts.

   Today, after the post-Reagan personal computer revolution and the
   post-Reagan end of communism, we no longer have the "closed" domestic
   economy we had in the eighties. Instead of additional disposable income
   stimulating job growth, it is more likely to go for developing new
   consumer markets abroad or capital equipment domestically, to reduce
   labor costs, insterad of creating jobs. [Note: the Bush housing
   stimulus was unique in that if did create a lot of blue collar skilled
   and unskilled labor jobs in construction.]

   That makes it more likely that a Romney Presidency would turn toward
   more defense spending, faster, as the tax cuts themselves fail to
   create jobs.

   A question for Governor Romney on Monday should be: How do you ensure
   that the size of the increase in defense spending you are proposing
   does not engender a new global arms race?

   Agree with all but the arms race. To have a race you need an opponent.
   At the moment no country would be foolish enough to join that race. A
   Romney-led US would find itself needing to start another war somewhere
   in order to justify the spending and then plunge further into debt
   sustaining the war effort...

   No nation state wants to kick sand in Miss Liberty's face, but the
   reason the Russians have given for backing off Nuclear disarmament is
   that they believe that Islamic extremists pose a credible threat. We
   didn't take that seriously thru 9/10/2001, and we seem to think that
   killing Bin-Laden accomplished something meaningful. Of course the NY
   Times Sunday Magazine, in August 2001 ran a story on Bush's initiative
   to focus Star Wars outward to protect us from Klingons. I can't give
   you the link, but I only wish I was making this up. Besides a boots on
   the ground invasion lets us re-start the draft, and that may be R&R's
   secret plan on unemployment; ship the 47% overseas. England did that
   for centuries.

   Thursday's Child - Hmmm...JFK was largely elected on the basis of the
   "Missile Gap" (along with a little help from Mayor Daly, in Chicago).
   Later, it turned out, there was no Missile Gap.

   Reagan turned toward defense spending to outspend the USSR and drive
   them into bankruptcy. At least that was the story AFTER they fell. Few
   would have predicted that, and it turned out that again the CIA
   over-estimated the sterength of the USSR (not complaining...I'd rather
   have them over-estimating, than under-estimating).

   I am confident that the neo-cons have a long list of enemies or
   potential enemies. Romney has, I believe, called Putin "a threat." He
   and Ryan have objected to a total pull out of all U.S. forces from
   Iraq. Romney has made threats of imposing tariffs on the Chinese...and
   there are many economists who will tell you that the return to a tariff
   regime with Smoot-Hawley in 1930 turned a recession into a global
   depression.

   Cbeck his website...I could be wrong, but I believe he's on record to
   increase defense spending by some $200 billion per year, over ten
   years. And, I suspect he would restore the Polish and Czech missile
   site program, as well as boost Star Wars spending.

   Doesn't have to be an actual war. Reagan didn't have an actual war. He
   avoided deeper Middle East involvement by pulling Marines out of
   Lebanon following the suicide bombing of their barracks outside of
   Beruit. And, he clandestinely armed the Afghans to fight the Russians,
   plus the deals with the Iranians over hostages and the Contras, in
   Latin America.

   What increases in defense spending do is "up the ante" and force
   "rivals" to turn away from their own economic plans to boost their
   defense spending. A lot of excuses...the Chinese recently launched
   their first aircraft carrier.

   And, defense spending combined with a neo-con preemptive war strategy?
   Yeah, I think that would get a lot of Russian and Chinese attention.
   Anbd, right or wrong, a lot of the world, including some prior allies,
   thought we went into Iraq against international law.

   bacon331 - interesting. I would have thought the reason for the Russian
   action on SALT would have been the Polish and Czech anti-missile
   sites...and that we're negotiating around that.

   Let's not forget that this is the land of the quick fix and limited
   attention span. We like our food to be fast (even if it kills us), we
   like our tv shows to be short (and shallow), we like our politicians to
   speak in soundbites (even if there is no follow-through), we like to
   make money quick (through high yield investments regardless of the high
   risk and potential to fail). So is it at all surprising that the GOP is
   succeeding in its pitch that if Obama hasn't fixed it yet he never
   will? It is a load of nonsense, but appealing for those who don't want
   to spend too much time working things out or remembering past last
   Thursday (like my uncle who watches Fox).

   It's quite the reverse here in Britain. We were also hit by the global
   recession in 2008 and our Labour (sort-of Democrats) government
   increased public spending to get us out of it. By 2010, signs of growth
   were beginning, but along came an election and the idiots in this
   country voted in a Conservative (the dreaded GOP equivalent) government
   who instigated punitve 'austerity' cuts and sent us crashing back into
   recession.

   Of course, the UK Conservatives have used the national deficit as an
   excuse to implement their ideology of dismantling the welfare state and
   privatising our National Heatlth Service to make a quick profit for
   their rich buddies... The Sheeple in this country have the same
   selective amnesia and nod in agreement as our Prime Minister takes even
   more money from their pockets to give tax cuts to millionaires. Jobs
   are being lost in the thousands and businesses are going bust left and
   right. Take the UK as a warning of what will happen if Rmoney (sic)
   becomes your President

   I am sure many voters can testify based on personal experience that the
   stimulus has made them a home owner, they love that gas prices have
   doubled, the recovery of the Dow Jones Index made them rich, their
   business goes better than ever, it's hard to find retail space, they
   just got a new Mercedes and they are very happy that non of the
   promises made 4 years ago have been kept. Pity, that I don't know a
   single person that would say that. Maybe, the stats don't reflect what
   the average person experiences. maybe the average person's statistics
   are quite different. And maybe the average person is sick and tiered of
   "the lesser of two evils", which is still evil. Maybe the people have
   initiated real change by siding with a presidential candidate that
   stands for the peoples interest and values. that candidate is Gary
   Johnson. Find out for your self if your a betting on the right horse

   I heard recently that US corporations are sitting on something like 5
   trillion dollars in cash. If true, why aren't these "job creators"
   creating jobs with that money? The owners of these companies are, I am
   sure, the same class of person as Romney - rich and wanting to get
   richer. I am afraid that they will continue to have this recalcitrant
   attitude toward job creation after the President is re-elected. They
   should all be tried for treason.

   I think it is closer to 3 trillion, but who's counting? During the
   recession, I saw with my own two eyes how employers downsized in order
   to survive, but when the recovery started they decided that the
   recession had given them a new business model. That is something like
   "hey, we survived with half the employees, and now profits are through
   the roof. Why not make this permanent".

   The bank I worked for remained profitable throughout and after, in
   spite of cutting half their employees, cuts in benefits, no 401k match,
   no bonuses. Recruiters I spoke with during those times said they were
   hearing a lot of that.

   Think about it. If all employers adopted that policy, it would become
   very difficult for an employee who is being run into the ground to
   move, because nobody would be hiring. Instead, those owners and
   executives were piling up money on their books, a lot of which ended up
   in their own deep pockets.

   I think that a big problem is with managers depending on computer
   modeling to predict the near future. The mortgage bubble popped because
   it had not happened and was hence not considered possible. In 2005, I
   was working for a unit of a large Multinational; we were running two
   shifts until the second shift supervisor was fired as a scapegoat. The
   job was advertised in company, no interest, re advertised outside, a
   qualified applicant was hired, he gave his old employer thirty days
   notice, relocated and showed up for work on Monday only to be told that
   the job was eliminated on Friday. Multi million dollar, new warehouse,
   with state of the art automation, now closed because the computer
   program chose to eliminate half of the work week over a thirty thousand
   a year job. At eighty plus hours a week we made money, at forty hours a
   week we didn't pay for the utilities and rent, and so the jobs were
   outsourced to China. The business plans that survived the Bush
   recession were okay but they have no tools for growth and recovery.
