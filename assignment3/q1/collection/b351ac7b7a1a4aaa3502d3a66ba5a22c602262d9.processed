Lost your phone charger? Grab a bike

   By Nick Scott, CNN
   updated 10:29 AM EDT, Wed September 11, 2013 | Filed under:
   [42]Innovations
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Siva Cycle is based in San Francisco
     * Through a Kickstarter campaign, Siva Cycle raised $126,000 -- much
       more than their goal

   Producer's note: Everyone's had their smartphone run out of juice right
   at the most inopportune moment.
   But now, [43]through Kickstarter, a company called [44]Siva Cycle has
   created a new device to make sure this never happens to you again. It's
   cheap. It's practical. And it's remarkably low-tech. We spoke to them
   via Skype, and they showed us how it all works.
