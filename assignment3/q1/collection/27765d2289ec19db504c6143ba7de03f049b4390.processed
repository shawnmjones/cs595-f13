   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Feds: Threats included an expletive-laden voicemail and an e-mail
     * The subject of the e-mail was "Cutting Off Tulsi Gabbard's Head,"
       federal affidavit says
     * Gabbard represents a district in Hawaii; the suspect is a former
       resident of that state

   (CNN) -- A man who allegedly threatened to decapitate Rep. Tulsi
   Gabbard of Hawaii appeared in court Friday in San Diego and was ordered
   to remain in jail for now.

   Aniruddha Sherbow made two threats to murder the Democratic
   congresswoman earlier this month, according to newly unsealed court
   documents.

   On August 1 the man allegedly left an expletive-laden voicemail on
   Gabbard's cell phone, with the message including a threat to her life.
   An affidavit said that Gabbard had been getting harassing messages from
   Sherbow since 2011 and identified his voice as the caller. The court
   document said Sherbow's mother later listened to the recording and told
   investigators it sounded like her son.

   On August 3 Sherbow allegedly sent an e-mail to the FBI and some
   unnamed media outlets and identified himself by name, according to the
   affidavit. The subject of the e-mail was "Cutting Off Tulsi Gabbard's
   Head."

   The message said in part, "I, Aniruddha Sherbow, with the Divine as my
   witness, do hereby solemnly vow to find Tulsi Gabbard, wheresover she
   may be, and to sever her head from her body."

   According to the court affidavit, Sherbow's father said he received a
   copy of that e-mail and he identified his son as the sender.

   The FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police said Thursday that Sherbow's
   threats were "deemed credible."

   Sherbow, 43, was arrested by Mexican law enforcement officers in
   Tijuana on Wednesday. The former resident of Hawaii was then turned
   over to the FBI in San Diego. He faces a charge of transmission of
   threats in interstate commerce.

   He is scheduled to have another court hearing on September 12, and
   officials eventually want him transferred to the District of Columbia
   for trial.

   Gabbard's office would not comment on Sherbow's arrest and the
   allegations against him. Press secretary Heather Fluit would only say
   the congresswoman was "grateful for the work" of all the law
   enforcement officers involved in the investigation.

   CNN's Laurie Ure contributed to this report.
