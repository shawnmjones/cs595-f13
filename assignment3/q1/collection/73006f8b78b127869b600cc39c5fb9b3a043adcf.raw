New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has for years been at war with his city's teachers union, using the giant megaphone available to him as both a billionaire and the mayor of the nation's largest city to slam the teachers at every opportunity. But in the past week it's become clear that teachers aren't the only ones to have problems with Bloomberg's heavy-handedness on education.
<p>Voters are not too happy with Bloomberg's role in the schools, for one thing. The city has mayoral control of education, so he appoints the school board. That means that Bloomberg owns education as an issue. He even owns mayoral control itself, which was instituted in 2002 at his urging, making him the only New York City mayor to have had such a large role in the city's education policy. And a <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-centers/polling-institute/new-york-city/release-detail/?ReleaseID=1832">new poll from Quinnipiac</a> finds that a strong majority of voters wants to move away from mayoral control: 63 percent want the the mayor to share control of the schools and 13 percent say the mayor shouldn't have any control, while just 18 percent say the mayor should keep control. That's in <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-03-06-mayor-bloomberg-schools_N.htm">sharp contrast</a> to 2009, when 55 percent of voters wanted mayoral control to continue.</p>
<p>It's not just that voters don't want the mayor in sole control of the schools, either. The recent Quinnipiac poll also finds that:<br /></p>
<blockquote>By a 53 - 35 percent margin, voter trust the teachers' union more than Bloomberg to protect the interests of public school students.</blockquote>
That's both a judgment on Bloomberg's recent actions against teachers and the context in which the current fights are playing out. And a big fight came to a head this week, centering on teacher evaluations.
<p>Thursday was the deadline for the city and the union to reach an agreement on a teacher evaluation plan in order to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in state education funding, but the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/17/1179858/-New-York-City-teacher-evaluation-talks-break-down-on-final-day?detail=hide">negotiations failed</a>. The head of the teachers union said that the union had reached an agreement with Department of Education negotiators, only to have Bloomberg kill the deal. Bloomberg, unsurprisingly, blamed the union, but head below the fold to see how his key reason for doing so crumbles when you poke it.</p>

		</div>
		
		
			<p class="divider-doodle" />
		
		
			<div id="body" class="article-body">
<p><a href="http://gothamschools.org/2013/01/17/bloomberg-blames-uft-for-killing-deal-with-2015-sunset-demand/">Bloomberg says</a> that the union's supposedly last-minute insistence that the new evaluation system sunset in 2015 would make the entire evaluation process "a joke," because "Nobody would ever be able to be removed. The law would be gone before the process could finish. It would essentially sabotage the entire agreement." But if that's the case, then about 90 percent of the school districts in the state of New York that adopted teacher evaluation plans have "joke" and "sabotaged" plans, because that's how many of them sunset after a similar length of time.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.edwize.org/caught-in-their-own-web-of-deception-and-deceit-bloomberg-the-doe-and-teacher-evaluation-negotiations">there are good reasons</a> for them to do that—and good reason to question Bloomberg's insistence that the union pushed the sunset provision as a way to kill the deal. UFT negotiator Leo Casey writes:<br /></p>
<blockquote>On the very last line of <a href="http://www.edwize.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/annual-professional-performance-reviews.pdf">this section</a> of the draft application, the DOE itself had written that the agreement would only last through the 2013-2014 school year. The preponderance of applications from school districts around New York approved had similar sunset clauses: given the sheer complexity of the new teacher evaluation systems required by New York State law, they reasoned that it was only prudent to revisit their implementation in a year or two. All of these applications have been approved by the New York State Education Department.</blockquote>
Michael Bloomberg wants New Yorkers to believe that the teachers union cost the city's schools hundreds of millions of dollars by killing an agreement with a last-minute demand for a provision that would render the entire evaluation system toothless. But Bloomberg is standing basically alone in describing the sunset provision that way. He's basically saying that we should take his word over the union, a draft application from his own Department of Education, and the New York State Education Department along with the 90 percent of districts including a similar provision in their evaluation plans. That's how arrogant, and how accustomed to having the media accept his claims without serious questions, Michael Bloomberg is.
<p>What's more, he expects to get people to blame the teachers union for this at the same time as he <a href="http://www.csa-nyc.org/node/937">killed an agreement for principal evaluation</a> over the same issue. And at the same time as 8,000 of the city's school bus drivers and attendants are on strike because Bloomberg refused to try to build any kind of protections for them into a bidding process for companies to take over many bus routes, particularly ones that service special education students.</p>
<p>Bloomberg's goal in the school bus strike is to blame the workers for wanting to maintain their lavish pay, which starts at $11 an hour for matrons and $14 an hour for drivers. What New Yorkers aren't supposed to notice is that it's <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/gonzalez-mayor-stop-blaming-bus-workers-article-1.1242198#ixzz2IKk0pXT7">Bloomberg's own policies</a> contributing to rising costs. Bloomberg has pushed for more and more charter schools, for instance, and "Some 20% of charter students ride school buses, compared to just 9% of regular public school kids, according to one Independent Budget Office estimate." Additionally, special education students, many of whom go outside the city to school, account for an overwhelming amount of the cost of busing, and:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Bus union president Mike Cordiello says many routes are so ineptly configured by Tweed bureaucrats that his members run 186 routes daily to Westchester County, most of them with 6 children or less per bus. There are 25 buses per day to New Jersey, 16 to Rockland County, several to Connecticut.</blockquote>
But as usual, Bloomberg's solutions target workers.
<p>Michael Bloomberg has pushed for and gotten more and more control in his own hands. But that's not enough for him. On top of it, he's trying to break anyone who might ever challenge his power, trying to make it easier to fire teachers and bus drivers, trying to erase the voices of people who work every day with children. New Yorkers aren't going for it, but that doesn't mean Bloomberg can't damage the cause of public education.</p>

		<p><b>More Tagging tips:</b></p>
		<p>A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?</p>
		<p>Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.</p>
		<p>If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. 
		CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.</p>
		<p>Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful.</p>

	<!-- <h4 id="p_tagErrorMessage">You must enter at least one Tag for this Diary Entry:</h4> -->
	
	<p><input id="p_tagInput" type="text" name="tag_draft" value="" size="70" />
		<!-- <input id="tagSubmit" type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" /> -->
	</p>

	
	
	<p style="font-style:italic">Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: 
	
	<a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Civil Rights');return false;">Civil Rights</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Community');return false;">Community</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Congress');return false;">Congress</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Culture');return false;">Culture</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Economy');return false;">Economy</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Education');return false;">Education</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Elections');return false;">Elections</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Energy');return false;">Energy</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Environment');return false;">Environment</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Health Care');return false;">Health Care</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('International');return false;">International</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Labor');return false;">Labor</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Law');return false;">Law</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Media');return false;">Media</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Meta');return false;">Meta</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('National Security');return false;">National Security</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Science');return false;">Science</a>, <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Transportation');return false;">Transportation</a>, or <a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('White House');return false;">White House</a>.
	If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state 
	(<a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('California');return false;">California</a>,
	<a href="#" onClick="addTagToField('Texas');return false;">Texas</a>, etc).
	Keep in mind, though, that there are many wonderful and important diaries
	that don't fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

<p>...and in the first election, the Democratic party was divided after a nasty (and racially tinged) primary. &nbsp;I'm not sure about the second (though IIRC, the candidate was the loser from the previous primary), but in 2009, &nbsp;Bloomberg spent about a hundred million dollars for a stunning 4 point victory over an uncompelling candidate who basically didn't campaign. &nbsp;Also, Bloomberg has spent about a quarter billion dollars of his own money on his three campaigns; we're basically talking presidential election money (at least up until the last 2 or 3 campaigns) spent on buying the mayor's office of a large city.</p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg gave $200K to the group trying to pass "education reforms" on the Idaho ballot. The initiatives were pushed through by Idaho Superintendent Luna and enough citizens freaked to get the whole ball of wax on the ballot last fall - all three were overturned. Bloomberg's donation was disclosed (along w/Foster Friess?!) by court order a couple of weeks before the election. Everyone knew the whole mess was crooked (ie mandating online classes provided by campaign donors) but seeing the big guns come in made me realize it's a country-wide effort. They are going after Michigan now - very ALEC-ish if you ask me.</p>

<p>for Bloomberg's stance. (Remember, too, that Bloomberg is a died in the wool Republican, and Republicans are at the forefront promoting many kinds of supply side myths and scamming systems.) &nbsp;<br />
Several years ago, Juan Gonzalez exposed the financial incentives for the wealthy to target public education with charter school BS. Here:</p>
<blockquote>"Wealthy investors and major banks have been making windfall profits by using a little-known federal tax break to finance new charter-school construction," Democracy Now! co-host Juan Gonzalez write in the New York Daily News. <strong>"The program, the New Markets Tax Credit, is so lucrative that a lender who uses it can almost double his money in seven years."</strong></blockquote>
Amy Goodman had him on Democracy Now, and his entire discourse on the subject is wildly accurate as we can now see: <a href="http://choosingdemocracy.blogspot.com/2010/05/hedge-funds-and-charter-schools.html">http://choosingdemocracy.blogspot.com/...</a><br />
Bloomberg is merely stunting for rich funders at banks and hedge funds.

<p>Before running in 2001. &nbsp;He switched to Republicon because he wouldn't be able to get elected with the Democratic field. &nbsp;He then switched to Independent I believe after his 2nd term started. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He bullied his way into getting "permission" to run for a 3rd term from the City Council and his (at that time) hand picked successor and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, along with the Council passed it (I was one of the Plantiff's in the Class Action suit to prevent this but we lost). &nbsp;Now Quinn who was in 2009 and now in 2013 planning to run for Mayor is kind of getting brushed off by Bloomberg, who has even asked Hillary Clinton to run for Mayor! &nbsp;He even paid off the 5 Republicon leaders to allow him to run on their line!</p>
<p>He has no respect for anyone. &nbsp;I think you all know about Superstorm Sandy which was on Oct 29th. &nbsp;The Sunday after the storm hit, we were supposed to have the NYC Marathon which starts in Staten Island and runs through all 5 boroughs. &nbsp;Staten Island looked like a war zone (still does in many places), 35 people killed, whole blocks of homes turned into rubble, no electricity, no food, flooding all over the Island and the other Boroughs were a mess also. &nbsp;Bloomberg insisting that the Marathon go on. &nbsp;His reasoning, well we had the Marathon 7 weeks after 9/11 so we should have this Marathon 6 days after Sandy! &nbsp;There was such an outcry from the public he finally cancelled it but was very angry that he had to.</p>

<p>Has publically given no statement on her feelings about Bloomberg asking Hillary to run for Mayor but I've heard that she's really pissed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>People are already holding it against her and have been since 2009. &nbsp;Additionally there are a few more matters that would make her the last person I and 99.9% of my friends and family won't be voting for her in the Primary and would have a very, very had time voting for her in the General in November.</p>

<p>There are basically four Democrats running for the Mayoral nomination:</p>
<p>Quinn: &nbsp;Too close to Bloomberg; she will be on the defense all summer and her numbers will fall</p>
<p>John Liu: City Comptroller- support of the Asian American community, but is being nvestigated about campaign financing problems.</p>
<p>Bill Thompson: Former City Comptroller, lost to Bloomberg in 2009. &nbsp;Good guy, would probably make a good mayor, but a little too low key, and he had his chance.</p>
<p>That leaves Bill DiBlasio, the Public Advocate. &nbsp;Italian American with an African American wife; commanding stature- he's about 6'4" (I've met him a couple of times); and already has support of some unions, including the teachers.</p>

<p>One part of the Myrlie Evers front-page diary which almost made me cry was where it referred to her grandmother and aunt as "respected school teachers." Yes, remember when school teachers were respected and not scapegoats for right-wing corporate media attacks?</p>
<p>It's disgraceful that the public narrative is that quality education is SO important that we have to beat up on teachers every way we can, yet teaching is not a secure, middle-class job anymore. That's talking out of both sides of your mouth.</p>

<p>as regards the way people talk about union negotiations even here, on a supposedly liberal site. &nbsp;The comments regarding the school bus drivers strike reminded me. &nbsp;SO MANY people when that first cam up were blaming the drivers, saying they're hurting the kids for greed, because they didn't like the details of their negotiating position or their willingness to walk out. &nbsp;Most of those people also trying to say they support unions.</p>
<p>It doesn't work that way. &nbsp;Unions are so incredibly under pressure right now, being attacked and whittled down on every front for so long, we literally cannot afford to attack them ourselves. &nbsp;Trust them to be doing the best they can with their situation and get out there in SUPPORT!</p>

<p>disparity is another, and I believe has become the worst problem our nation has faced in generations, worse than the late 1920's. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your income nears many hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars per day, what tax breaks or deductions could possibly still be justifiable? &nbsp;It serves no substantive societal interest for so few to take so much while so many worked to create the wealth and end up with little to show for it. They'd still make way more than 99.99% of us so it's not really a credible 'punishment' that will make them give up and stop trying to earn more. If anything, it would make them work harder, since they'd still be making more by doing so. &nbsp;A stout progressive tax system just slows the upper rates of gain while ensuring a fairer overall distribution of the wealth. &nbsp;America's fastest periods of economic growth occured under much higher tax rates than the present. &nbsp;If the minimum wage actually kept up with the cost of living, and maintained a plausible ratio with the earnings increases of the rich, it would have to be more like $20/hour. &nbsp;And we'd still be behind other 1st world nations in vacation time, maternity benefits, sick days, pensions, education benefits, etc.</p>
<p>The attempts by the richest and most powerful in this nation to limit 'sharing the wealth' in the last 4 decades, with their increasing demands for cutting worker pay and benefit give backs/austerity/etc., has created an increasingly huge disparity between America's rich and poor, and now close to half of us are near or under the poverty line, even if working multiple jobs, and is shredding our social safety net programs. &nbsp;With so many Trillions in our economy, that's a real crime that so few are sharing the benefits of the huge productivity our whole society of hard workers has enabled. &nbsp;It's not 'socialism' or 'communism' to advocate for more fair and more equal terms in sharing this American wealth made possible by the labor of so many--that's just advocating we truly share the rewards of hard work with the hard workers. We've given away far too much to 'shareholders' and the CEO executive class in the last few decades. And they expect us to hand over even more. We can say 'No' to the most greedy demands with a firm tax reform that brings back progressive income tax and, as the bonus, our revenue problems go away while our government spends on the programs that benefit the majority of us, not just the top 1% of us.</p>

<p>and as such, is an even better argument against businessmen running government.</p>
<p>Bloomberg has all the attributes of his class: arrogance, imperiousness, and the certainty that he knows what's best for everybody. He thinks you're too fat, so it's no Big Gulps for you! Plus, maybe he'll save a few bucks on Medicaid.</p>
<p>Bloomberg is fundamentally at odds with the democratic process. He prefers to rule by edict. Hence, we have his bizarre insistence on a no-cellphones-in-school policy against the pleading of parents who wanted their kids to be able to call home in case of any emergency -- 9/11 hasn't been forgotten. Why would Bloomberg stubbornly insist on blowing off these parents' concerns? Because they had the nerve to question his authority.</p>
<p>His time as mayor of NY has many examples of his insistence on unpopular projects and laws and his petulance when he doesn't get his way. One of them was the ridiculous rip-off West Side stadium that was basically a boondoggle for his real estate pals. Of course it was always open season on any public union outside police and firefighters.</p>
<p>Bloomberg as CEO is used to snapping his fingers and saying, "Make it so!" And if that doesn't get him what he wants, he'll buy it -- like an illegal third term. He's an arrogant prick who actually thought he could make a run at the presidency. Bloomberg, along with Romney and Bush Jr, are the best object lessons in why government should never be run like a business.</p>

<p>without a top-notch public education system. It's a shame that we've let ours devolve into the shell they've become. And most of the blame for that lies with bad governance, not bad teachers or unions or a lack of privatization in the form of vouchers or charter schools or the corporatization of public schools. And teachers are part of the solution, not problem.</p>

<p>.... in my district/union negotiations of the teacher evaluation plan. Of course we put in a sunset clause. Of course we all agreed that we need to sit down together in a year and look at what is working and what might not be working in order to make the process a better one. I guess it depends on what the parties are trying to accomplish. If Bloomberg is only concerned about his ability to fire teachers then the process is already broken. Of course every evaluation plan in the state already has a major flaw in it. There are still mandates to use standardized test scores to evaluate, teachers, principals and schools.</p>
<p>Both the Administrators and the union members in my district agreed that using state mandated test scores as part of a number grade for teachers and principals is inappropriate, but for now we don't have a choice in the matter. In our agreement we tried to protect those teachers who will be subjected to the state generated numbers (4th - 8th grade language arts and math teachers). I won't try to explain specifically how that was done.</p>
