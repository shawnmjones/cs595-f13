   Feeling betrayed by the Republican Party and its leaders, tea party
   groups in Ohio appear to be uniting and moving toward either a split
   from the GOP or action to punish Republican candidates who fail
   ideological purity tests.

   A series of events, culminating with the April 26 election of Matt
   Borges as chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, spurred a flurry of
   meetings and conference calls among tea party leaders last week to plot
   a course of action heading into the 2014 statewide election.

   Options being discussed, according to Seth Morgan, policy director for
   Americans for Prosperity, range from breaking off into "a third party,
   to an insurrection (within the Republican Party) and everything in
   between."

   Tom Zawistowski, executive director of the Portage County Tea Party who
   lost his bid for the Ohio GOP chairmanship by a 48-7 vote of the
   party's state central committee, met on Saturday with Don Shrader,
   chairman of the Constitution Party of Ohio, to explore uniting in a
   party committed more to principles than winning elections.

   After the chairmanship vote, Zawistowski said he made it clear that if
   the state GOP did not focus on enacting conservative policies, "we
   would either find a political party to join or we would start one of
   our own," saying his meeting with Shrader "is the first step in that
   process."

   It remains uncertain, however, just how much the Ohio GOP and its
   candidates could be hurt by an insurrection because it is difficult to
   assess the true strength of tea party groups. A 2012 poll by The
   Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation found that about 28
   percent of Republicans identified themselves as tea party supporters.

   Although loosely organized in 2009 around ideals of fiscal conservatism
   and smaller government, the tea party largely has been fractionalized
   with no single acknowledged leader.

   "There are potential splits within the tea party itself," said John
   Green, a University of Akron political scientist. "It's hard to judge
   how strong they are because their popularity fluctuates. It's not a
   cohesive group, but it does have some resources and some talented
   people who are quite effective."

   Along with Zawistowski and Morgan, others in the tea party movement
   viewed as effective leaders include Chris Littleton, founder of Ohio
   Rising; Ted Stevenot, president of the Ohio Liberty Coalition; and Matt
   A. Mayer, president and CEO of Provisum Strategies, a Dublin-based
   consulting firm.

   To date, said Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, the tea
   party's "biggest Achilles' heel is there is no defined leadership to
   focus a message. It's almost a flavor-of-the-month type of thing.

   "Some of these men and women who proclaim to be the leader of this,
   that or the other and get quotes in the paper, I'm not sure that
   they're really taking the pulse of the rank and file (Republicans) in
   the state," Gonidakis said. "To say they don't represent anyone would
   not be accurate. But to say that they represent a majority viewpoint,
   I'm not sure that's accurate because if it was, their candidates would
   be able to win primaries or they would have success in various
   political offices."

   But tea party leaders say their ranks are being swelled by social
   conservatives who oppose abortion and gay marriage and who are angry
   with the Republican Party.

   "On all these conservative issues across the board, I think we're all
   joining hands because we're stronger together," said Lori Viars, vice
   chairwoman of the Warren County GOP and leader of Warren County Right
   to Life.

   The list of tea party grievances includes action last December by
   Republican legislative leaders to bury the so-called heartbeat bill,
   which would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected.Social
   conservatives also were riled by U.S. Sen. Rob Portman's change of
   position on same-sex marriage after his son revealed he is gay, and by
   the election of Borges, who once lobbied for Equality Ohio, a
   gay-rights group.

   Fiscal conservatives were incensed by Republican Gov. John Kasich's
   budget proposals to expand Medicaid health services to 275,000 needy
   Ohioans, to broaden the state sales tax and to tax shale oil and gas
   producers.

   "I think the appointment of Borges was just the final straw that did
   pull those social and fiscal tea party groups together to say, `We're
   tired of being used on Election Day,'" Morgan said. "There's no
   question the movement is done with this proverbial pat on the head that
   the Republican Party has always given us. I have never seen this level
   of discontent."

   Viars said the failure of GOP leaders to be true to the conservative
   policies they portend to embrace has pushed tea partyers to the
   breaking point.

   "How many times do you get smacked in the face by the Republican Party
   before you're ready to make some other arrangements?" she said. "I
   don't know what that is because we haven't set on any particular course
   of action."The suggestions range from everybody leaving the party in a
   mass exodus, to staying in the party but get challengers in primaries
   for every race of anybody who ever crossed us, to under-voting in
   certain races."

   Led by Littleton, tea party leaders took at least partial credit for
   the GOP-controlled House killing Kasich's Medicaid expansion by
   threatening to field primary-election opponents against Republican
   lawmakers who supported it. Littleton said Ohio Rising and other tea
   party groups have the grassroots expertise and resources to reach GOP
   primary voters.

   "We're doing such amazing targeting right now," he said. "It is so easy
   to get our message out when you know what needs to be said and how to
   reach those individuals. Certainly, we think that proved to be a
   credible threat."

   But with Kasich and other GOP elected officials facing a strong 2014
   challenge from a Democratic ticket led by Cuyahoga County Executive Ed
   FitzGerald, one longtime Capitol Square Republican activist who asked
   not to be named questioned the tea party's end game.

   "Is Ed FitzGerald going to sign a pro-life bill? Is Ed FitzGerald going
   to sign a pro-gun bill? Is Ed FitzGerald not going to expand Medicaid?
   What do they think is going to happen if they abandon John Kasich and
   play spoiler by creating a third party?"

   Ronald Rapoport, a political scientist at the College of William and
   Mary in Williamsburg, Va., who last week released a new study titled
   "Republican Factionalism and Tea Party Activism," said tea party
   "threats for a primary should be taken seriously."

   His research showed that tea party supporters comprise "a clear
   majority" of voters "who show up for Republican primary elections."
   Rapoport said tea partyers are ideologically "super-mobilized" and are
   interested in taking over the Republican Party "and purifying it to
   what they think the party should be" rather than compromising on
   principle.

   "It's clear that establishment Republicans who have a different set of
   priorities care more about elections than tea party members who care
   more about principle and purity and they're less willing to compromise
   in order to get elected."

   Rapoport said that the peril for a Republican Party that already "has
   gotten smaller" is that the more influence the tea party gains over it,
   the less appeal the GOP will have to voters overall because surveys
   show that a majority of voters do not support the tea party.
