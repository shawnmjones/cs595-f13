Why Are Conservatives Trying to Destroy the Voting Rights Act?

   A five-decade bipartisan consensus on this key piece of civil rights
   legislation has collapsed--right when we need its protections more than
   ever before.

   In 2006, Congress voted overwhelmingly to reauthorize key provisions of
   the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for another twenty-five years. The
   legislation passed 390-33 in the House and 98-0 in the Senate. Every
   top Republican supported the bill. "The Voting Rights Act must continue
   to exist," said House Judiciary chair James Sensenbrenner, a
   conservative Republican, "and exist in its current form." Civil rights
   leaders flanked George W. Bush at the signing ceremony.

   Suppression Law ([72]US Politics, [73]States)

   Seven years later, the bipartisan consensus that supported the VRA for
   nearly fifty years has collapsed, and conservatives are challenging the
   law as never before. Last November, three days after a presidential
   election in which voter suppression played a starring role, the Supreme
   Court agreed to hear a challenge to Section 5 of the VRA, which compels
   parts or all of sixteen states with a history of racial discrimination
   in voting to clear election-related changes with the federal
   government. The case will be heard on February 27. The lawsuit,
   originating in Shelby County, Alabama, is backed by leading operatives
   and funders in the conservative movement, along with Republican
   attorneys general in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina,
   South Dakota and Texas. Shelby County's brief claims that "Section 5's
   federalism cost is too great" and that the statute has "accomplished
   [its] mission."

   The current campaign against the VRA is the result of three key
   factors: a whiter, more Southern, more conservative GOP that has
   responded to demographic change by trying to suppress an increasingly
   diverse electorate; a twenty-five-year effort to gut the VRA by
   conservative intellectuals, who in recent years have received millions
   of dollars from top right-wing funders, including Charles Koch; and a
   reactionary Supreme Court that does not support remedies to racial
   discrimination.

   The push by conservatives to repeal Section 5 comes on the heels of
   what NAACP president Benjamin Jealous has called "the greatest attacks
   on voting rights since segregation." After the 2010 election, GOP
   officials approved laws in more than a dozen states to restrict the
   right to vote by requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote,
   shutting down voter registration drives, curtailing early voting,
   disenfranchising ex-felons and mandating government-issued photo IDs to
   cast a ballot--all of which disproportionately target communities of
   color. The states covered by Section 5 were significantly more likely
   to pass such laws than those that are not.

   Attorney General Eric Holder has called Section 5 the "keystone of our
   voting rights," and the Justice Department and voting rights groups
   have argued that it is an essential tool for dismantling barriers to
   the ballot box. "The record compiled by Congress demonstrates that,
   without the continuation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protections,
   racial and language minority citizens will be deprived of the
   opportunity to exercise their right to vote, or will have their votes
   diluted, undermining the significant gains made by minorities in the
   last forty years," Congress stated in reauthorizing the act in 2006.
   The disappearance of Section 5 would be a devastating setback for
   voting rights--akin to the way the Citizens United decision eviscerated
   campaign finance regulation--and would greenlight the kind of voter
   suppression attempts that proved so unpopular in 2012.

   Overturning Section 5 is in many respects the most important battle in
   the GOP's war on voting. As Holder noted in a recent speech, there have
   been more lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of Section 5 over
   the past two years than during the previous four decades. Section 5 is
   in the gravest danger at a moment in contemporary history when it's
   needed the most.

                                    * * *

   The Fifteenth Amendment, which Congress ratified in 1870, states that
   the right to vote "shall not be denied or abridged by the United States
   or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of
   servitude." Yet it took nearly a century, until the passage of the VRA,
   for those words to become the enforced law of all the land. "Section 5
   was not the first response to the problem, but it was the first
   effective one, enacted only after case-by-case litigation and less
   stringent legislative remedies failed," says a recent brief filed by
   the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The law led to the abolition of poll
   taxes and literacy tests; spurred massive voter registration drives;
   and laid the foundation for generations of minority elected officials.
   Even conservatives like George Will regard the VRA as "the 20th
   century's noblest and most transformative law."

   Section 5 gave the law its bite. As Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in
   the 1966 case South Carolina v. Katzenbach, the first of many
   challenges to the statute, the law "shift[ed] the advantage of time and
   inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to its victims." The burden
   of proof was also shifted to the perpetrators, who now had to show that
   a voting change was not discriminatory before putting it into effect.
   "Section 5 gives the federal government a more effective tool for
   combating discrimination in voting than anything else that Congress has
   ever come up with," says Sam Bagenstos, a former deputy assistant
   attorney general for civil rights in the Obama Justice Department. The
   law covers all of Alaska, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana,
   Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, and parts of
   California, Florida, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina
   and South Dakota.
