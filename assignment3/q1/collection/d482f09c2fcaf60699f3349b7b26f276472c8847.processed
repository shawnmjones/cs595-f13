   A little more than a month after Michigan Republicans [69]successfully
   passed landmark anti-union legislation in their state, members of the
   Pennsylvania General Assembly are attempting to follow in their
   footsteps. Six Republican state representatives are [70]each bringing
   their own "right-to-work" style bill to the State House floor, as part
   of an effort [71]collectively known as the Open Workforce Initiative.

   One of the legislators involved, Rep. Darryl Metcalfe, has reportedly
   introduced right-to-work bills [72]during every legislative session of
   the past 14 years. "The framers of our Constitution did not intend for
   our government to become an enforcer for unions," he explains on
   [73]his website. "Working men and women should have the freedom to join
   a union if they choose and to leave that union when it is in their best
   interest to do so."

   Metcalfe's success record so far might reassure union allies that
   Pennsylvania is unlikely to turn into another Michigan. In fact,
   Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett, a Republican, [74]said as much
   during the Michigan right-to-work battle, telling reporters, "There is
   not much of a movement to do it."

   However, Corbett has also said he would sign right-to-work legislation
   if it came across his desk. Furthermore, though the right-to-work bill
   which Metcalfe proposed in 2011 predictably failed, his persistence was
   rewarded with a [75]House Labor and Industry Committee hearing in July
   of that year.

   Rick Smith, host of the regionally syndicated radio program The Rick
   Smith Show, said that at least one of the proposed 2013 bills had a
   chance of passing. "The Bloom bill is particularly dangerous because it
   may be viewed as not as extreme while achieving the same destructive
   ends," he said over email. That was in reference to House Bill 250,
   proposed by Rep. Stephen Bloom, which would allow unionized public
   employees to exit the union whenever they choose.

   While it seems unlikely that Pennsylvania could go entirely
   right-to-work any time soon, it's worth noting that same thing was true
   of Michigan only a couple of months ago. And while Pennsylvania's union
   density is above the national average, it is [76]slightly weaker than
   in Michigan. Meanwhile, some of the same forces which helped pave the
   way for right-to-work in Lansing are now mobilizing in Philadelphia:
   The Pennsylvania chapter of the Koch outfit Americans for Prosperity
   [77]announced on its Facebook page that it "stands in solidarity with
   our coalition partners to move Right to Work in PA."
