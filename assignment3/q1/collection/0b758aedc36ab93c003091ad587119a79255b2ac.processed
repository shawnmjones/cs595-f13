[23]Unemployment and underemployment rate among college graduates shows the
problem isn't lack of skills

   joblessness among college youth up to 2013
   Heidi Shierholz at the Economic Policy Institute [30]writes:

     The large increase since 2007 in the unemployment and
     underemployment rate of young college grads, along with the large
     increase in the share of employed young college graduates working in
     jobs that do not require a college degree, underscores that today's
     unemployment crisis did not arise because workers lack the right
     education or skills. Rather, it stems from weak demand for goods and
     services, which makes it unnecessary for employers to significantly
     ramp up hiring.

     The figure [above], from this report on the labor market prospects
     of the Class of 2013, gives unemployment and underemployment rates
     for college graduates under age 25 who are not enrolled in further
     schooling. The unemployment rate of this group over the last year
     averaged 8.8 percent, but the underemployment rate was more than
     twice that, at 18.3 percent. In other words, in addition to the
     substantial share who are officially unemployed, a large swath of
     these young, highly educated workers either have a job but cannot
     attain the hours they need, or want a job but have given up looking
     for work.

   The underemployment statistic covers those working less than full-time
   hours even though they want full-time work. But they don't cover young
   college graduates who are working at jobs that do not require a
   four-year college degree. Even in good times, many graduates work at
   such jobs for a variety of reasons that often have nothing to do with
   economics. That is, they could find a job in their field if they
   wished, but they have other concerns at the moment.

   However, from 2000-2007, the percentage of young college graduates
   working in jobs they were "over-educated" for increased. And it
   increased still more during the Great Recession, which officially began
   in December 2007, as jobs for new college graduates dried up as
   millions already in those jobs were laid off. This shift has improved
   only marginally since then. In research soon to be released,
   Shierholz's colleague Andrew Sum found that 47 percent of employed
   college graduates under age 25 were working in jobs that didn't require
   a four-year degree in 2007. By 2012, this percentage had risen to 52
   percent.

   This year's college graduates face a very tough job market. But the
   data show that their prospects aren't weakened because they lack the
   right skills, Shierholz says, rather because the continuing weak demand
   for good and services by consumers means employers don't need to add
   significantly more workers regardless of their levels of education.

   One grim aspect of the weak labor market is that young graduates will
   take jobs not in their field or take jobs in their field that pay less
   than was paid to new entrants several years ago. Studies show that such
   coerced choices can have a lasting impact. Thus, graduates in the class
   of 2013 on average are likely to be earning less 10 or 15 years from
   now than they would have had they received their diploma when the
   economy was healthy.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       large wads of cash, and not hiring because doing so would make
       substantial inroads on that cash? There are probably all sorts of
       innovative products companies could be making.
       Three-D printers spring to mind.  I read an article that said 3D
       printers could print out sets of false teeth, given the right

 The argument is not that they need more cash ([212]0+ / 0-)
       the argument is that its not worth their effort to invest the cash
       unless they get better rate of return.
       IE just using magic numbers here. At current tax rates a company
       would get a 3% return on investment, as such they would rather just
       sit on their cash(ass) and do nothing.
       If by cutting various taxes that turns into a 5% or 6% return on
       investment. Than the companies would be MUCH more eager to invest
       their capital.
       That is closer to their argument.

       adversaries.

   I actually work in this field doing market research and analysis. The
   problem is that what is really needed is college graduates, preferably
   Masters level, with a strong chemistry background.  The biggest
   limitations on 3D printers is having the right material. If you have a
   strong chemistry background, there are a lot of companies interested.

   That is the problem with this premise of equating college graduation
   with skills. What is mostly needed is math and science majors. I have a
   masters degree in biology with a strong chemistry background. I have
   rarely gone unemployed.

   I am not an apologist for the corporate world. I am retiring in 7
   months because I am completely fed up with it; however, graduating
   college does not necessarily mean a person has skills that are needed
   in todays employment market.

   Suppose your factory can make 10,000 widgets with 10 workers, and sell
   10,000 widgets. Suppose you hired ten more workers, and made 20,000
   widgets - but people still only want to buy 10,000.

   Businesses don't hire somebody just because they have an extra $50k
   lying around. A lot of political talk is based on this wrong idea.

   In fact, a business with no money at all might hire somebody for $50k,
   if they were sure they could get $100k of profit out of his work.
   That's why banks lend to businesses.

   Companies have that money, but it isn't sitting in vaults like you
   think. It's invested in the stock market where it's being put to work
   creating jobs already. IBM doesn't sit on hundreds of billions doing
   nothing. They invest it in ventures and securities where they can get a
   return on the money. So, if you think you can just pull that money from
   them, a lot of jobs go bye-bye.

   The only place where the money is sitting and doing nothing is in the
   treasury where the banks have loaned $$$ to the government and they
   must be paid interest for that loan, which in turn is a loan from the
   government. Everyone owes everyone, hence derivates.

   This whole damn thing is one big house of cards thanks to fiat money
   and a lack of any real backing of currency and the ease with whioch
   money can be created out of thin air. Don't be fooled. Politicians of
   both parties are just as greedy as banksters, corporatists, and crony
   capitalists.

       You are right they do put it in short term investments, but cash is

       bank, and that bank does still make investments.
       But....
       I can see how cash and cash equivalents could add up to trillions.
       All companies are leveraged to their cash on hand to some extent.
       The idea is that you want the average leverage to increase so more
       cash is being put to work so more people are employed.

   No doubt though globalization has helped lift improvished

       college degree equals marketable skills.  As a college professor, I
       can assure it does not.
       Today college students need to look long and hard at what the
       economy can actually give them in the way of jobs before they
       commit to a course schedule and the student loan debt they are
       likely to incur.

       they (this year's graduating HS seniors) have to look, not at what
       the market is demanding today, but at what it will be demanding
       four or five years from now (if everybody majors in what's hot
       today, there will be a glut tomorrow). And this is particularly
       difficult in technology fields, because hiring there tends to
       follow boom-and-bust cycles with periods uncomfortably similar to
       the length of time it takes to get a college degree.
       Thus, the kid who pursues a tech degree runs the risk of graduating
       in a down cycle, at which point his choices are quite limited:
       either pursue graduate study until there's an up cycle, or go into
       a completely unrelated field and stay there (because if he goes
       into an unrelated field, especially a non-degree field, just to
       tide things over, he's going to have a lot of trouble getting into
       his original field when things heat up again because employers are
       going to be looking only at new grads, with the unspoken assumption
       that anyone who couldn't get hired in the bust just wasn't any good
       in the first place).
       Obviously this isn't a problem for HS seniors who show every sign
       of being truly stellar in their fields: a kid who graduates MIT
       with a 3.80 isn't going to have any trouble getting hired. But
       that's a small majority of students, and always will be.

     And this is particularly difficult in technology fields, because

     uncomfortably similar to the length of time it takes to get a

       I think that in technology fields, like computer programming,
       unemployment rates are pretty low even in down times.  We have
       dramatic boom-and-bust cycles, but even in bust years the market is
       starving for good programmers.

     (if everybody majors in what's hot today, there will be a glut
     tomorrow)
       That's the advantage of getting a degree in CS or engineering.  Not
       everyone can major in mechanical engineering, because not everyone
       can pass differential equations.  You can't have a sudden glut of
       XYZ majors unless it's fairly easy for everyone to just switch over

   The problem is that it just lumps all majors togehter as "college
   graduates" when all the data shows that in today's market, your area of
   study -- i.e., your skills --- really matter.  I think it would be more
   relevant to see statistics for specific majors/areas of study to see if
   there is a "lack of skills" at play here.

   I know several people graduating in engineering of various types --
   chemical, mechanical. petroleum (big in oil and gas producing states
   like Louisiana).  They are having no trouble finding jobs.  I think all
   the [337]data shows that your major -- your "skills" have a LOT to do
   with your [338]chances of getting a job.  If you Google some form of
   "least employable degrees," you will find that [339]same areas over and
   over -- various forms of arts and humanities, along with psychology,
   typically lead [340]the lists.   Simpy put, if you major in something
   like dance, or art history, or film, your chances of finding a job that
   uses your degree are much, much lower than if you major in Electrical
   Engineering.

   If it is true that some areas of study have very low unemployment rates
   and some have very high unemployment rates, then there may be a
   mismatch of skills to demand.  I don't think it paints an accurate
   picture, in today's job market, to lump all college graduates together.
    More and more, the area of study [341]really matters.

       we need to be realistic with college students.  If you are going to
       borrow $150,000 to go to college and major in art history,
       financially it might be smarter to consider forgoing college and
       learning a marketable trade or skill.  Or maybe, if you are set on
       college, consider a major in a high demand area, or even a
       moderately high demand area, and a minor in the area you love.
       I'm not sure how you would think the private sector will create
       more jobs for those "high rate of unemployment" majors.  The job
       market, like any other market, responds to demand, and if there's a
       very low demand for Library Science majors -- as there apparently
       is -- people who chose that major need to be realistic about their
       employment opportunities in that field.  The job market just
       doesn't "create" jobs because people like that field.  You can't
       graduate in film, or anthropology, or library science, and think
       that someone owes you a job. Life doesn't work that way.  Most
       things in life are a trade-off.  If you major in something you love
       but that is not in demand, the trade off is that you will have a
       harder time finding a job that uses that major and usually you can
       expect to make less money if you do.

       and would have to play into things, I think.
       As I posted below, the overall number of adults with a college
       degree is at a all time high.  It would be interesting to see what
       number of people have various degrees, what the unemployment rate
       is for each major (and also, at what age, so we know if it's recent
       graduates not being hired or older workers being laid off) and
       whether the unemployment rates are driven in part by certain types
       of degrees, and if so, how much.
       All of this means that a number that shows all college graduates
       lumped together really doesn't tell us much.

       Marketable means that you can list skills on a resume that are
       scarce and valuable (usually because they are really hard to
       acquire.)
       A business major is certainly a career-oriented major, but not
       marketable like accounting or computer programming.

 There are a lot of variables ([496]4+ / 0-)

   I would share what my daughter did for students to consider. First, if
   you are looking ahead on what the labor market will be in 4 years, by
   the time you get there, it will have changed. Plan a mid course review.

   Due to her dyslexia and unwillingness to take on a lot of debt, Lauren
   went to a very good community college first. She worked up to 20 hours
   a week at a part time job and only took half the normal credit hours.
   She had grad HS with a high GPA and SAT, so was able to get some grants
   and found a lot of small scholarships. These take time to chase down on
   the web and are small. They can add up to cover books, fees, etc. (I
   called this the PayGo plan ;)

   Lauren had a clear goal in mind for engineering, designing wheel chairs
   and adapting sports equipment for the disabled. The part time job was
   in the distribution area of her job goal. In 2004 the expectation was
   she would be able to get a niche job and make a decent living.

   She transferred to CO School of Mines when it was time to start
   engineering classes. Before the last year the student is in community
   college is a good time to reconsider what the job market is doing and
   if there is an interesting option with more potential. A few core
   courses might be different.

   The last two years at Mines one of the programs she had gotten funds
   from didn't come through. She had some family help but had to take out
   more than planned in loans. By then, her job experience, the
   skyrocketing number of war vets with wheel chair and prosthetic needs,
   and being accepted into the National Engineering Honor Society (Tau
   Beta Pi) had upped the long term job security and the short term hiring
   potential.

   Finally, graduation day became 5/10/13. She began applying and
   interviewing for jobs in March. Mid April she called to say she'd had
   three phone interviews with a leading wheel chair manufacturing company
   in Fresno, and they were flying her out for a meeting with the
   engineering design team.

   The company had already hired one new grad. They had been on the verge
   of offering the job to a local engineer with 3 years of experience (not
   in this field) when her ap and resume came in. Since the company she
   worked for here did a lot of business with the manufacturer, Lauren had
   a contact in the orders dept who knew her well. The gal had copies of
   engineering drawings Lauren had sent for custom items, not to mention
   years of good communications.

   She took a portfolio of different projects as well as her own designs
   to the meeting and was able to lay out the three main issues in wheel
   chair design that engineers have to deal with. She explained some of
   her own ideas about those, the engineers joined in. The job was hers.
   Salary very good for non petroleum engineering grad, plus good
   benefits. (Tomorrow is the day of benefits, policies, ID card, etc.
   Weds is the start day for being an engineer!)

   One thing not mentioned here or in other discussions, is what it costs
   a company to train a new hire to independence. Nurses are pushing $90
   K. Have no idea about engineers but it is likely significantly more
   since they really need a full year of internship for many jobs. The
   idea is to present as someone who already knows some of the nuts and
   bolts, will be able to learn quickly, etc. The inside contact was a
   bonus - there could have been turnover in that job.

   The obvious area for job security now is health care. There are many
   jobs besides nursing or direct patient care. Given the shortages in
   many skilled positions, adding 50 million people to the number of
   recipients is going to be a nightmare. As I have written about,
   [501]GOP obstructionists never funded the ACA committee that was to
   address the health care work force shortages. Anyone looking to
   positively have a job when they graduate needs to look at all the ones
   available. Keep in mind there are oodles of places to be a nurse, you
   can get an AD degree in 2 years at a community college - if the schools
   don't have a waiting list. Do NOT go to a strip mall school.

       My kids started getting pressure to chart their paths and decide on
       college when they turned 14. My oldest is now in community college
       and working. Much more affordable and much more time to figure out

       She actually took a year off after hs. I had wanted to do that and
       got NO support from my parents. It would have helped a lot. My
       birthday is in early October and I was always one of the youngest.
       Here in Denver, in '95 my son was finishing 8th grade and the
       spring parents meeting at the high school was totally about
       college, AP classes and the ACT/SAT tests. We moved that summer to
       a school district that was more balanced. He went to OSU and ran
       into a lot of stupid professor imposed barriers. He quit and did
       menial work until Lauren pushed him to look around. Was able to get
       into a small company and does computer programming without the
       degree, so far.
       The pressure for her got really crazy at Mines, although my nephew
       at CU has similar problems. The other nephews are grown up - oldest
       great nephew graduated from high school Sat. in Ft Collins. Those
       nephews both graduated from CSU and the pressure doesn't seem that
       much better. I am so appalled at how much drinking and drugs are
       used. The local hospitals and EMT get stocked up and prepared to
       handle the overdoses every weekend.
       Combination of the really nasty teaching tactics, so many loans,
       lousy job prospects. Lauren had friends who graduated from Mines 2
       years ago that couldn't get a jobs for a year and some.  At the
       graduation ceremony I was noting all the bachelors, masters and
       doctorates in fossil fuel related fields. I really wonder how many
       of them will not have the loans paid off by the time the jobs start
       evaporating.  Hopefully they have enough engineering to transition
       to renewables.

 I wonder if the students who choose classes in ([517]0+ / 0-)

   arts, humanity, psychology etc take these classes only because they
   believe they never could pass the hard science classes. And I wonder
   how much that has to do of how Math and Sciences is taught in

   foundation from their highschools years I would say it's no wonder. The
   way it's continued to be taught in entry level college classes I don't
   wonder anymore.

   May be I had a bad experience as anecdotal evidence,  but if 60 percent
   can't pass a basic biology class something is wrong and I believe it's
   not just the student's fault. It is possible that a highschool student
   has almost no science education whatsoever.

       She's a lifer, and will be able to retire in eight more years.

       She'll be getting a PE and another acronym in the spring, during

       She loves Engineering, I knew it when she was three - she made the

   In the marketing profession, which I'm apart of, there are lots of
   growth opportunities for recent graduates in marketing.  Go to the
   American Marketing Association and it's got plenty of ways for students
   to connect, network and find opportunities.  If you have a bachelor's
   in marketing, then what you need to do is build your resume, maybe
   volunteer for a non-profit in online or social media marketing or what
   not (or your local AMA chapter) while you're on the job search.

   To be frank, I always hear the same stories:  People go apply for jobs
   on online boards and job fairs.  Same story as I've heard before again
   and again.  For the career network I'm a member of, we emphasize more
   proactive job searching as opposed to passive job searching.

   In the San Francisco area, hiring is crazy right now.  The deal is,

   Our American economy hasn't been able to achieve full employment
   without financial bubbles since the early 1970's.  The private sector
   has finally reached it maximum capacity to expand spending (RE:GDP)
   though increasing its debt load.  Private sector debt topped off at
   over 300% debt to GDP at the height of the bubble in 2008 before
   starting to come down...thats over $40 trillion!  Now that the private
   sector is re-balancing its books or deleveraging.... we should expect
   to see continued depressed demand until such a time when private sector
   debt has bottomed out and starts to climb again absent any new fiscal
   expansion by the Federal Govt.  At the current pace of deleveraging, it
   looks like we still have almost a decade left assuming we don't have
   any new recessions to make the problem even worse.  If incomes were
   higher and growing than we might be able to expect to see some economic
   and demand growth coming out of increased wages but with our real
   unemployment rate (U-6) still around ~15%, that doesn't look likely.

   Everyone should definitely check out this post for a much more detailed
   summary of the ways in which our economy has been damaged in the last 4
   decades by faulty neo-liberal economic mythology, and with lots of
   great graphs to illustrate our economic reality.

   nuanced (see my comment above about why the area of study matters
   greatly).

   I looked it up, but as I suspected, the percent of adults with a
   college degree has hit a [603]record high.

   I suspect that a generation ago, someone with a college degree -- any
   degree, in any area -- was generally more valuable in the job market
   simply because fewer job applicants had college degrees.

   When you have far more people (as a percent of the population) that
   have college degrees, the degree in and of itself is not as valuable in
   the job market, simply because it's not as rare.  In today's market,
   when almost a third of adults have college degrees, the area of study
   matters much more, I suspect.

   In other words, it may well be that there is still a "skills gap."  The
   "skills gap" simply is not that there are not enough college graduates;
   it may be that there are not enough graduates in areas of demand.
   While there are more people with degrees, the question is whether is
   whether those degrees are in the areas of demand, or come with the
   skills that today's market is demanding.

   economy and those once were cured by companies training their employees
   or trade union/corporate apprenticeship programs. The issue is demand
   and declining wages, not skills mismatches. Shifting the burden of
   training and acquisition of job skills from the hiring company to the
   individual worker. Placing the economic burden on the individual and
   not the corporation.

   The excuse of skills mismatches is just another red herring for the
   neoliberal Democrats and Republicans that want to create a highly
   skilled but completely indebted workforce. Taking advantage of job
   insecurity to lower wages and benefits is an old game.  Demanding that
   employees acquire skills at their own expense that are job specific to
   the needs of corporations and then hiring that person for as little pay
   as possible, is the new manifestation of that old game.

   Creating a highly indebted, low payed work force with little job
   mobility and fewer benefits is the dream world of the employer and the
   nightmare of the employed and those seeking work.

   This whole argument is about power, the power of corporations to
   dictate the policies that affect workers and economic activity
   generally. The workforce skills mismatch is simply a crypto-fascist
   argument to make social responsibility seem passe. To shift all social
   goods into the hands of private interests and to make moral judgements
   of worker value instead of social judgements about systemic failure. If
   the problem is a lazy unskilled workforce, then corporations and
   government have no place in providing a solution, which is exactly the
   position of the neoliberals. This whole skills mismatch position is
   simply a piece of neoliberal propaganda, not an honest economic
   argument.

 Maybe the elephant in the room is ([645]1+ / 0-)

   the fact that many colleges turn out people that are not getting what
   they paid for.

   College course that are, on paper, qualifying people to work, actually
   aren't giving students the skills they are purported to have.   In many
   cases, it's a poorly run resort, a holding tank for kids that will put
   up with them and keep them from hurting themselves until they mature to
   a point where they aren't as dangerous to society.

   Really bright students that take a lot of AP courses and study on their
   own do well, graduate, and get good jobs.

   Other students, who don't know the material beforehand, expect to be
   'taught' the information and skills they don't have, and demoralized
   grad students and TA's aren't that helpful while the course teacher is
   off somewhere.

   Kids with the advanced social skills already taught them by their
   parents over family dinner and at family social events are successful
   competing for the attention of the college.

   Those from lesser backgrounds who aren't attractive, poised and pushy
   pay their money, but don't get a return.  They see that college really
   is no a ladder up, but they don't dare tell their parents how poor
   their experience is because they don't want to seem ungrateful and
   wrong.

   Cost of college has gone with the increase in loan money available, not
   any increase in quality.

   Likewise, it floors me that so many premed students who do well, take
   up space in those classes, and then end up running the family business,
   like a restaurant or dry cleaners that their parents struggled with in
   order to pay their tuition.

   College ain't what is seems.   It's as much a con game as shells and
   peanuts.

 Excuse me? ([649]0+ / 0-)

     Other students, who don't know the material beforehand, expect to be
     'taught' the information and skills they don't have, and demoralized
     grad students and TA's aren't that helpful while the course teacher
     is off somewhere.
       This seems to read as a complaint that students starting a class
       haven't already mastered the material taught in the class. Or, even
       more bluntly, it's a complaint that if most students took the final
       on the first day of class, they'd flunk. If that's the case, what's
       the point of having classes in the first place? Why not just have
       tests?
       Sometimes truth is spoken from privilege and falsehood is spoken to
       power. Good intentions aren't enough.

 Yes, that's what I am saying. ([653]0+ / 0-)
        Colleges don't teach students, students teach themselves.    If
       they aren't smart enough to teach themselves (skills they should
       learn in high school) they will graduate without having learned
       anything.

 The study seems to address pretty traditional ([660]0+ / 0-)

   career tracts. Get a degree, get a job that at least gets your foot in
   the door of your chosen career.

   Education is becoming hybridized - some classes, some life experiences,
   internships, certificates -- resumes are more patchwork than they used
   to be (I should have links to the information behind this thought, I
   know - hoping to write a diary on some of the current trends - no time
   to go searching at the moment).

   What about entrepreneurships that can get started while still with your
   family our at a relatively young (like college) age? What about the
   trades? What about free-lancing?

   A college degree is a really expensive investment that not all career
   or life paths require. It takes creativity to get by and to find your
   way.

   And creative careers like design, art, theater, writing, certainly
   don't require degrees, but I have a friend who pushed her artistic son
   through four expensive years of college that he hated (her debt,
   fortunately for him). He is fine living in someone's garage and
   painting - taking paid jobs for murals when he could get them. I don't
   think he's worried about more than getting by.

   I'm encouraging my kids to look at a wide range of options, unlike my
   parents who never offered up any advice beyond getting a college
   degree. Not very useful in the end.

   I'm loving learning about all the options and possible paths with my
   kids. I'm discovering new paths for myself.

 some college degrees more useful than others ([663]0+ / 0-)

   Where I teach, I see a lot of kids majoring in psychology, French
   literature, and other "soft" liberal arts fields that are not
   especially useful in the job market. The school is trying to encourage
   them to pair those up with minors in business, graphic design, or
   something else that's more job-related. (For example, one of my French
   major kids is minoring in International Business -- smart move.) I'm
   torn; as a humanities person I want to see well-educated people in
   terms of culture and literature and history and all that. I don't want
   to see colleges become just trade schools. But keeping an eye on "what
   might you do with this out there in the world?" seems prudent too.

   When you add in the kids who aren't doing much real work in college,
   just sliding through and enjoying "the college experience," I'm not
   surprised that employers don't necessarily give them much extra credit
   for that.

   Most college students mojor in things like history, political science,
   English and several other completely useless areas. The young people of
   today need to start learning engineering, plumbing, carpentry, things

 The need is Now! ([669]0+ / 0-)

   If we do start investing in these trained educated individuals, our
   country will slowly decline. Corporate America must understand that it
   is the flow of money that makes our economy work. An if educated
   skilled workers can not get a job in their field of training and study,
   then what is the point of obtaining that education. We have to invest
   and innovate or stagnate and decline. By investing in people who will
   invest in their future. The flow of money through the economy.
