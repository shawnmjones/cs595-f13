   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   Before the introduction of [208]antibiotics, [209]consumptives would be
   sent to [210]sanatoria, residential homes in locales with clean air,
   often in the countryside, far from cities, by the sea or in upper
   alpine districts in Switzerland, France, Italy and Austria.  Before the
   [211]1956 and 1968 Clean Air Acts, which banned burning  non-smokeless
   fuel, London was infamous for its fog, to the extent that many
   Americans still think it is.  The [212]Great Smog of 1952 is estimated
   to have killed up to 12,000 people.  This is well within living memory.

   when the people that live in such polluted environments will actually
   evolve to adapt to such conditions?

   The masses that do not have the choice to move to cleaner environs,
   will their children have mutations that make them more suited to
   breathe such foul air?

   The populations under these conditions in China are so much more
   massive that if such mutations occur, they will be passed on.

   Is this what can happen when the elite when the leadership and elite
   are so completely out of touch with rest uf the people?

   The alternative of course is that Chinese leadership will evolve to
   fight to mitigate these conditions and clean things up.

       (and I don't play one on tv), but it seems to me that evolutionary
       mutations would probably involve a high number of failed mutations
       (read: death and disfigurement) before a survivable mutation
       occured. So there could be millions of deaths and untold suffering
       before humans evolved to breath what is currently toxic to us.
       Odds are it wouldn't happen at all and, unchecked, the pollution
       could bring about our near extinction. And the roaches would win
       the world.
       Which means that, though the products themselves would be much much
       smaller, SE Asia could retain ownership of the running shoe
       industry and production would triple.
