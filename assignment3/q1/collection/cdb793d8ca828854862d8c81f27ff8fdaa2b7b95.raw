I work for one of the world's largest software companies. For the most part, they are very good at celebrating diversity for just about every group but the mobility challenged. I have a rogue's gallery of photos of employee and corporate vehicles parking in the spaces marked for handicapped access only. No matter how many times I report this, and they reassure me it will be taken care of, it just continues. To me, this is not a great example of embracing diversity. It just tells me that if you aren't able to post photos of your last hike or marathon finish, you really aren't considered a visible member of the company.\n\nMany people assume that all disabled persons have a powered wheelchair that allows them to zoom everywhere, so parking a bit further out shouldn't be a big deal; perhaps it's because the icon shows a person sitting in a wheelchair. That simply isn't the case. I walk with a cane, and walking up any sort of an incline or having to walk more than half a block causes me a great deal of pain. If you park your car in a handicapped space because you are just going in to pick up your kid, or are waiting to pick someone up, you are not only commiting a parking infraction, you are causing a disabled person to suffer pain because you couldn't be bothered to park further away. Have we really gotten to a point as a society where that is acceptable? I find it every bit as wrong as the horrrible acts being visited on the LGBT community in Russia just because of who they love. Yet no one seems to be holding up signs or running campaigns about how blocking access to the disabled by parking in reserved spots is a hateful thing to do.\n\nTrust me when I say I would love to be able to be able to park further away to get a bit of exercise. I would take the stairs instead of the elevator in a heartbeat, and I would take them two at a time for the sheer joy of it. The point is, I cannot because of injuries to my spine and pelvis. \n\nPeople, please do not park in the spaces marked for handicapped access. And if there is a crowd of people waiting to board an elevator and there is a handicapped person or for that matter, an elderly person, or a harried parent lugging a stroller, please take the stairs instead. I don't care if you feel it was their choice to have a kid. I don't care if that man in the scooter is 400lbs, and you think he'd be better off getting up and walking. You don't know his story and it's not your place to judge. Be considerate and compassionate. You never know when you might be the one who needs that parking space or that next spot in the elevator.","ranges":[],"aggregatedranges":[],"hasTranslatableContent":true},"author":"1489298692","ftentidentifier":"724585034237619","likecount":9,"hasviewerliked":false,"canremove":false,"canreport":false,"canedit":false,"source":1,"istranslatable":false,"timestamp":{"time":1376261777,"text":"August 11 at 3:56pm","verbose":"Sunday, August 11, 2013 at 3:56pm"},"spamreplycount":0,"replyauthors":[],"isfeatured":false},{"id":"724585034237619_106705770","fbid":"724588807570575","legacyid":"106705770","body":{"text":"Stupidity is a plague.","ranges":[],"aggregatedranges":[],"hasTranslatableContent":true},"author":"1066058100","ftentidentifier":"724585034237619","likecount":10,"hasviewerliked":false,"canremove":false,"canreport":false,"canedit":false,"source":1,"istranslatable":false,"timestamp":{"time":1376256544,"text":"August 11 at 2:29pm","verbose":"Sunday, August 11, 2013 at 2:29pm"},"spamreplycount":0,"replyauthors":[],"isfeatured":false},{"id":"724585034237619_106706395","fbid":"724598274236295","legacyid":"106706395","body":{"text":"I can't count the number of times I've seen people use disabled spaces for waiting zones, motorcycle parking and \"I drive a BMW and can park where I please\" parking.

Try using a wheelchair around a busy parking lot. How many times have you been almost run over by drivers who can't see you out of their mirrors due to the fact you are seated?\n\n2. Disability can happen in an instant to anyone at any time due to accident, injury, or birth defect. How would you feel if you had an accident and were unable to walk unassisted without any form of support from those around you? If you live long enough chances are you will become disabled.\n\n3. In Canada and USA Obesity is actually a disability. It is an epidemic! There are many reasons obesity happens. For example some people eat a lot after experiencing trauma. Some have prescribed medications to take to help them deal with other illnesses. Those medications have side effects- including making people gain weight. If it was just too much eating, then no one would have problem losing weight. We wouldn't be experiencing an epidemic in this country.\n\n4. What about if you were the driver who hit a person with a disability because that person couldn't find a disabled parking spot? How would you feel? Do you think you would be found innocent in court?- Chances are probably you would be found guilty both through your gut feelings and through the criminal justice system. You would probably be told that you failed to safely get out of your parking spot and as a result you are guilty of either killing or injuring someone. In some states such as California if you hit a person with a visible disability- your fine and jail time triples.\n\n5. Some disabilities are not visible. For example no one can tell how much a legally blind person can or can't see- all they know is that they are not totally blind, they do have limited vision. Some use a cane making easier to identify them, and some don't out of fear that they will receive discrimination. Mental illness and developmental disabilities cannot sometimes be seen by the naked eye. It doesn't mean they are not real and their not present.It is not up to us people to judge what others have and what others are going through. Another good example of a disability that isn't often visible is a stroke. Someone with a stroke can lose their ability to judge distance, to talk, and to make sound judgements making it hard for them to manuever safely around parking lots and streets.\n\n6, What happens if you became a parent of a child with a disability or an adult child taking care of a parent with a disability? how would you feel if you had no safe place to load and unload your love one from your vehicle?\n\nI am a person with a developmental disability and mental illness. I was born with my disabilities. I also am a daughter of a father who is legally blind and hard of hearing- he wasn't born that way, in fact he just became legally blind and hard of hearing 6 years ago. We both use canes to get around safely. He uses a while cane and I use a  walking quad cane.Despite my disabilities I graduated college with honors and I have my drivers license. I drive him everywhere he needs to go. i would like to be able to park my car in the disabled parking spot so we can go shopping together. He didn't cause his disability and neither did I. My disabilities were caused by a birth defect, and his were inherited. His disability does happen to a lot of otherwise healthy seniors. So don't assume just because we're disabled we caused it. No one wants to become disabled. It sometimes just happens. What we would like is to have the opportunity to go out into our community and be safe- just like everyone else! \n\nSo before you reply to this message and the video posted above...think..how would you feel if someone didn't allow you to be safe while travelling out in your community? How would if you experienced first hand or witnessed your love one being discriminated because of their disability? I bet you wouldn't like it.","ranges":[],"aggregatedranges":[],"hasTranslatableContent":true},"author":"100004606211372","ftentidentifier":"724585034237619","likecount":11,"hasviewerliked":false,"canremove":false,"canreport":false,"canedit":false,"source":null,"istranslatable":false,"timestamp":{"time":1376260393,"text":"August 11 at 3:33pm","verbose":"Sunday, August 11, 2013 at 3:33pm"},"spamreplycount":0,"replyauthors":[],"isfeatured":false,"recentreplytimestamp":{"time":1376414357,"text":"August 13 at 10:19am","verbose":"Tuesday, August 13, 2013 at 10:19am"}},{"id":"724585034237619_106707180","fbid":"724615267567929","legacyid":"106707180","body":{"text":"Lighten up people!

Its not about invisible disabilities, obese purple, etc.  Its about people that aren't allowed to use those spots, using them anyway.  If you have a valid handicap placard, you're free to park in the spot, regardless of what handicap it was issued for.  If you don't have a valid handicap placard, and you park in a handicap spot, that's when you qualify as stupid (add the sign suggests), and your car should be towed to the nearest impound lot for breaking the law.  Again, regardless of any disability you do or do not have.  \n\nThere are means for handicap people to get legal permission to use those spots.  If you have a handicap and either choose not to get a placard, or are denied one because your condition doesn't qualify, you are no more entitled to those spots than anyone else.  As good or bad, fair or unfair it may seem to you, the spots are not simply for anyone with any handicap.  They are for those who have the required placards, period.\n\nIf you have problems with the way the handicap parking system works, don't get upset about a post meant to be funny, and bitch to George Takei or argue with his fans about it.  What's that gonna solve?  If its an issue that truly concerns you that much, look into the issue and start taking steps to try and get it changed!  \n\nHeck, considering the number of comments I've seen so far, I imagine if you started a petition to get another disability recognized for parking, and posted about it in these comments, you'd have a ton of signatures overnight!
