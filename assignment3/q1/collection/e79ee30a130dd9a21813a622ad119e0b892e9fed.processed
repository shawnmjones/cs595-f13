[47]Barack Obama: A Peek Behind the Scenes of an Interview With the President

   By Chris Cuomo and John Griffin, CNN

   Syracuse, New York - The crowd gathering outside Henninger High School
   in Syracuse, New York, is buzzing, but polite. Young men dressed in
   dark suits and bright bow ties, PTA mothers, band members wearing
   T-shirts with "GRADUATE" emblazoned across the back, even the
   occasional anti-fracking or anti-Keystone XL pipeline protestor. All
   have gathered for this moment.

   Actually, it's a moment about five hours from now, when President
   Barack Obama is set to take the stage here, to unveil his plan to make
   college more affordable. According to the White House, the cost of
   college has ballooned some 250% in 30 years, while Americans' salaries
   have gone up just 16%. Obama's going on a two-state tour to discuss his
   ideas for alleviating that disparity that, economists say, is robbing
   young Americans of a future free of debt, and the nation as a whole of
   its potential. For now, though, it's 1:30 in the afternoon, 90 degrees
   and, while the crowd jockeys for the best position in the line and the
   magnetometers are being warmed up, dark clouds develop on the horizon.

   That storm would later take down my live shot with Jake Tapper and his
   show, "The Lead." Certain types of satellite truck signals, being of a
   certain wavelength, are actually too "big" to penetrate a sky full of
   clouds. We call this "rain fade," and my live hit is kaput before I've
   finished answering the first question.

   The storm that would unload on us next nearly rips our tent out of the
   ground, and douses us with rain. I'm here and doing live shots for one
   reason: later this evening, after the president's speech, I will
   interview him exclusively on a wide array of topics: his college
   affordability initiative, to be sure, but also Syria, Egypt, NSA
   spying, even the president's relationships with his growing daughters,
   and the family dog.

   Dodging back into Henninger High School to avoid the rain, I'm
   impressed by just how dramatically this sprawling Syracuse institution
   has transformed from school to citadel. The advance team escorting us
   around the space has been here for a week. Sensitive areas the
   president will pass through are draped in thick, dark velvet so no one
   can track his movements through the school. Exterior-facing glass has
   also been blacked out, covered in a thick paper to protect the
   president from, if not a bullet, then from a shooter's ability to aim
   it. Everyone is carefully segregated: the bystanders from the ticketed
   crowd for the address, the ticketed crowd from the media, the media
   from the president's teams, etc.  And since the school has had its
   final "sweep," wherever we move within it, we must be "handled,"
   escorted from place to place. Around every corner, an agent stands
   guard, listening to his earpiece or talking in his sleeve. If it all
   feels like a movie, that's more a commentary on Hollywood paying
   attention to the details than the agents being clichéd.

   Speaking of clichés, the room that has been selected for our interview
   is the school's band room, and it is every bit what you would expect:
   xylophones poke out of lockers, an upright piano sits, well-worn, in
   the corner, musical staffs are pre-drawn on the blackboards and
   inspirational messages are pinned to the walls. It looks, and feels,
   pretty much precisely like the set of "Glee," a metaphor which takes on
   even more depth after our crew finishes lighting it and pointing
   cameras at it. In the end, the shot is beautiful.

   And, after that, we wait, we make notes, we discuss, and we wait.
   Another live hit for the "Situation Room" follows, and this time, it
   goes off without a hitch. The weather has mostly cleared. We watch the
   president's address where his plan, and his subtle swipes at congress
   for its inaction, electrify the crowd. And then back to waiting. As the
   time of our interview gets closer, we make final adjustments, check the
   shots, check the audio, check our gear. We have to be ready the moment
   the president sits down.

   The president is coming. Lights off, phones on vibrate. Here we go.

       Wow, what a hard hitting interview. I guess when the Cuomo family
       hosted Obama for dinner (pre-interview) had nothing to do with it.
       On Egypt, are any of you clueless fools at CNN aware that this
       so-called President supports the Muslim Brotherhood - the one and
       same that tried to blow up the WTC in 1993? Probably not because
       most of your so-called reporters were in kindergarten at the time.
       What is next for CNN, staged news reports from on the scene with
       fake Palm trees just like you did during Desert Storm. Does anyone
       at CNN seriously believe that any one with half a brain fall for
       the garbage can of lies CNN airs every day? This is why your
       ratings suck, you are a bunch of phonies.

       Mr. President and Mr. Cuomo, your statement that most of the middle
       class supports OBAMACARE is totally false. The middle class has
       been taxed to death to pay for Mr. President's socialist agenda.
       Mr. President, where is your public apology to the families whose
       loved ones were recently murdered by teen African Americans? I
       didn't hear Mr. Cuomo ask you if it was your intent to give the
       perception of a double standard. It is the President who is out of
       touch!

       In all my years i have never seen people who this President for all
       the world's problem, you live thru Nixon, Carter and Bush who
       started 2 wars and cost Trilions of dollars But u lives thru it.
       This Presisent was dealt a terrible hand and has done nothing tried
       to clean up and do a little good at the same time. He's not prefect
       President but niether was Regan. He had no hope from Congress they
       have the treated him far worst than any President even Clinton but
       he has still prevailed. You people need to quit the last president
       sent men off to die, an you guys complain about drones strike on
       people that are trying to kill Americans. Please don't mention the
       race card because Obama has done more for every other group then
       Black. He has never been the all black president. So quit crying
       and vote your guy in...oooppps your party doesn't have a guy who
       can win. guess thats obama's fault to.

       Obama is following Saul Alinsky's book, Rules for Radicals to a
       tee. From my understanding, he taught Rules for Radicals in
       College. Basically, Rules for Radicals states to change a society
       to what you want it to be, you must agitate you opposition, create
       an atmosphere of class and race warefare, and weaken the economy so
       more people become dependent on the Federal Government. If you are
       honest with yourself, Obama has been successful in all those areas.
       All this misery is created on purpose and CNN and the rest of the
       media who follow Obama, the Pied Piper, will go off the cliff with
       him when America finally becomes a Socialist and possibly a
       Communist Nation.

       the balck on white killings and beatings recently, but wait till it
       turns around and whites start waiting in the dark for blacks, oh
       then they will cry racism again. oh we frown on this they sau when
       its black on white, but when its white on black its racism, I can
       no longer respect or even give the time of day to any of those as
       obama, jackson or sharpton, we know who is racists and who hate
       whites abnd we know the truth now. the page will turn and it will
       turn soon.

       An 88-year-old White World War II veteran was brutally beaten and
       left for dead by two black teens outside a lounge in Spokane,
       Washington, where he loved to go play pool.
       The motive? Police don't have one. The teens appeared to have
       picked him at random, authorities say.
       SOUNDS LIKE A BLACK ON WHITE HATE CRIME

       hey obama, once again blacks beat and kill a white man in
       washington who was a veteran and you say nothing, maybe its time
       the whites, cubans, white hispanics and the white native americans
       start forming groups and pay back by beating blacks at random. you
       talk you talk and you talk but do nothing except play the race
       card. That old man could have been my grandfather, the australian
       boy could have been my son, the boy ob the bus could have been my
       grandchild, so what you got to say now obama. it is time to meet
       fire with fire and pay back those who want to play.

            If the black boys get off then he should talk about how the
            veteran could have been his grandfather. The difference here
            is that GZ got away with murder. These boys won't and
            shouldn't!! They are bad people and there are bad people in
            every race, just like the victims. The difference comes when
            the justice system allows murderers to go free.

       because he ran away and didn't take his actions within the system
       and wouldn't face charges. Chris Hedges has showed courage,
       patriotism, and speaking truth to power. By Obama's description
       this would be his definition of a patriot and a great American. Ask
       him if he will characterize him that way?

       I am a small business owner and a major supporter of the

       consider myself in the minority though. I am not sure that HHS has
       done the best job it can letting individuals and small businesses
       know what is coming for them. I think people get the pre-existing
       conditions, the free wellness visits, but the exchanges, the tax
       credits, the mandates, are all somewhat mysteries to the average
       small business owner and citizen. What will we see in the coming

       My husband is university professor. He teaches physics. After 25
       years of incredibly hard work, he is now full professor and makes
       slightly over 140K. He teaches usually one class of grad students 3
       times a week. He prepares the material for the class which is not
       only his lecture, but also includes preparing individualized
       problems to be solved (which are not taken from any of the
       textbook), and provides solutions for them after the tests is over,
       prepares extra support material etc. All this preparation takes him
       on average about at least 20 hrs per week as it is not some simple
       material and he is very responsible teacher. The rest of the time
       he works on his research, corrects papers of his co-workers, writes
       scientific papers, writes grants proposals to support his research
       and provide salaries for his post-docs, he corrects papers which
       are sent to him for reviews. He works from home, because he may
       work in here undisturbed, therefore many people may think that he
       does not work because he is not in his university office. Those
       people who suspect this are the types who cannot imagine that
       anybody would work without some timer and supervisor. He is his own
       supervisor. His scientific output is his timer. Most of the time he
       begins to work about 9AM and with short breaks for some food or
       exercise he works until 1 or 2 AM at night or sometimes even later.
       This also includes weekends. Sunday is exception because he goes to
       church, but after that he still goes back to his office at home or
       university. Of course he has also to go to the university to give
       the classes, tests, quizzes and various exams (for instance
       qualifiers for PhD programs) and provides special time for
       students' visits in his office. He attends faculty meetings and
       many other mandatory meetings. All this takes the time from his
       research and that is why he tries to make up for this working on
       his research at home.
       He works on average at least 90 hrs a week!!!
       I hardly can have any time with him. He teaches quantum mechanics
       and other advanced physics courses, and with the grants he wins due
       to good results of his research, he provides salaries for members
       of his group. He has to work this hard because otherwise he would
       not be able to have results to publish and consequently to win the
       grants. In such scenario his post-docs will lose their salaries,
       because he is their provider. 140K is good salary, but for decades
       he worked the same number of hours and his salary was much, much
       lower. He was building his reputation for many years. For many
       years we could not afford any fancy family trips. We backpacked
       with kids and the tent, cooked our own meals during our vacations,
       because we had not enough money for hotels. For a long time we
       could not afford more than one car (he biked to the university).
       Any little money we had, we invested into education of our kids
       (through some extracurricular activities). We had one car only
       (Toyota Corolla) until it got 250Kmiles on it and we had to replace
       it. I shopped in Goodwill stores for years, because the new stuff
       was too expensive for us. Now, it is better, but it was lifetime of
       sacrifices to get to this point. Nobody who complains here would
       want to work so much for so little for so many years as he did. And
       this is very stressful work as you fight for your scientific
       survival every day. And remember, he also worked hard to get his
       education and superior grades, to be able to seek a position of
       university professor. And now finally after 25 years we have enough
       money to replace carpet in our house, which we were told should be
       replaced after 9 years.
       I realize that Harvard, Princeton, Columbia etc. may pay some of
       their professors big salaries, but on average this is not the case.
       University where my husband works is large, good (in some areas
       excellent) school and I believe it is representative of the average
       university in the country. So, don't tell me how easy, good and
       worry free is a life of university professor, because you obviously
       have no idea what are you talking about. (Excuse my English, it is
       my second language).

       Why is Obama pushing for free trade even though it creates a

       even though it is proven that they are affiliated with Al qaeda and
       kill civilians? I doubt CNN will ask these questions. CNN will
       probably ask what Obama plans to do about college costs (Hes
       already said what he will do) and would he like to add something to

       do. And in this case is have an interview with CNN at 6am. Obama is
       doing it because he has to. CNN should be thankful. Obama wants to
       spread the word, and that's the way to do it. He wants to show the
       American people what he wants to do, before he sends it to
       Congress, and they won't pass it again. If Obama has 100% support
       on a bill, good luck with that bill passing Congress.

       DHS employee spends spare time promoting race war against 'whites'
       A Department of Homeland Security manager in charge of buying
       weapons and ammunition for the government is, on the side, running
       an inflammatory website that throws around gay slurs and advocates
       the mass murder of "whites" and the "ethnic cleansing" of "Uncle
       Tom race traitors," according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
       Ayo Kimathi, who calls himself the "Irritated Genie," told his
       supervisors that the website was set up to sell concert and lecture
       videos.
       But the report showed the site's content strayed far beyond concert
       promotion, warning about a coming race war. His website, "War on
       the Horizon," declares, "in order for Black people to survive the
       21st century, we are going to have to kill a lot of whites
       One of Kimathi's former supervisors at DHS told SPLC's Hatewatch
       that, "Everybody is the office is afraid of him," and that his
       co-workers are "afraid he will come in with a gun and someday go
       postal."
       Kimathi, who works for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,
       which is a division of DHS, reportedly got the go-ahead from the
       government to create and maintain his website.

       Many Americans do not have the confidence in the health care law
       you signed. Wouldn't it ease some of their concerns if you yourself
       covered yourself and you family through the exchanges, along with
       requiring your entire staff to do so as well? I am sure the
       American taxpayer would be happy to reimburse your health insurance

       Ask him if he's discovered that as president he actually has no
       real power to change anything. It's either that or he simply lied
       through his whole campaign and never intended to do anything he
       promised.
       I was just over at Democracy Now watching a video of Sen. Obama in
       2005 making a grand speech about how American's freedoms have been
       taken away by the National Security apparatus and these secret
       courts and domestic spying. It was very surreal. You could
       literally super impose the Obama from 2005 video on to the Obama
       who recently spoke in defense of the NSA and create quite an
       entertaining verbal battle from polar opposite sides of the debate.
       I really don't understand how so much of the country can keep
       giving this administration the benefit of the doubt for so many
       years without their patience and common sense finally waking them
       up. The power center in this country is NOT in the whitehouse or
       the congress. It's not even visible or accessible to the American
       people. This country has been lost!

       I would like to ask how does he think his 'scorecard' is going to
       actually lower costs for students. He claims this scorecard will
       allow students to shop around for the best bang for their buck. I
       am sure he is aware that almost every state has lower tuition for
       in-state students than they do for out of state students. In
       reality this scorecard will only allow students to shop within
       their own state. For instance, I live in North Carolina where
       ins-state tuition is relatively low, even though it has increased
       substantially over the last few years. This relative 'deal' on
       college costs is only available to residents of North Carolina. How
       is this actually going to lower costs? It sounds a lot better in a
       sound bite than it does when you actually sit down and think about
       it. I would like to hear his thoughts on this.

       Ask him about the following:
       First, almost 50% of Americans have less than $500 in savings. Not
       surprisingly 1 out of 3 residents of Obama's home state of Illinois
       live in poverty. A mind numbing 4 of 5 Americans are either
       experiencing poverty, foreclosure or welfare, or will in their
       lifetime.
       Auto sales are collapsing. The age of the average car, now 11.4
       years, rose to a level we haven't seen in YEARS. Construction jobs
       are falling off a cliff. And U.S. factory orders just suffered the
       biggest drop in a year.
       731,000 of the the 953,000 new jobs gained since start of 2013 are
       crummy low-wage part time jobs that won't pay the bills of an
       average middle class lifestyle. So far this year over 246,000
       low-paying waiter or bartender jobs have been added to the U.S.
       economy, versus only 24,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs.
       The Obama administration just hired a company to promote ObamaCare
       over the phone to Americans - guess what? Even those jobs are
       part-time, with no health insurance!
       And, the second biggest employer in America is now a temp agency!
       Only 44.7% of working age Americans (16 and over) have a full-time
       job.
       Food stamp rolls are growing seventy-five times as fast as
       employment. The national debt has increased by 50% under Barack
       Obama. Obama promised to reduce health insurance bills for an
       average American family by $2,500 per year, instead your health
       bills went up by $3,000 per year.
       Meanwhile, labor participation by men is at the lowest rate ever
       measured - since they started tracking it in 1948. And here's the
       clincher: 90 million able-bodied, working-age Americans are not
       working.
       Nearly 5 million workers are classified as long-term unemployed,
       while 900,000 more have stopped looking for work altogether,
       according to a new series of reports issued by the Urban Institute.
       40% of the unemployed (or 4.2 million) remain without jobs 4 years
       into the so-called Recovery which distinguishes the 2008-2009
       recession from previous downturns such as the 1980s when only 25%
       remained unemployed for more than 6 months.

       He will not talk about lowering college costs. He will talk about

       So, expect to hear about government subsidies and grants (lowing

       lowering student loan interest rates (lowering the cost of

            The problem is that the tax payer can't foot the bill. There
            is about $1 Trillion in student debt in the US right now,
            mostly garunteed by the Federal Government. I don't know if
            you remember but the total cost of the 2008 economic crisis
            was $12 Trillion after accounting for lost GDP, people that
            were picked up on welfare and medicaid, and the bailouts
            (Better Markets financial analysis report). Now, the financial
            crisis was caused, initially, by what was known as the
            "housing bubble" bursting. That was only worth $700 Billion
            approx. So, if a "higher education bubble" bursts, and the
            individuals collectively default on thier loans, the
            Universities will go under because the government would not be
            able to collect the revenue to bail them out, because a
            second, and larger, financial crisis would occur, and will
            likely occur either way. We are approaching another tipping

            The day marijuana will be more important than education, I
            will leave planet Earth.

            the only people who care about marijuana are the sellers and
            abusers.

       The best thing to do is to quit making it so easy for a college
       student to get into debt over $130,000 for a degree which MAY get
       them $30,000 a year...stop the financial aid debt trap. Make it so
       students choose less costly (but just as good) community colleges.
       The big name schools and for profits will see their enrollment drop
       and then either go the way of the Do-Do or drop their tuition
       rates. The government's insistence on helping students jump into a
       river of debt is facilitating the rise in tuition rates.
       Universities charge as much as they do BECAUSE THEY CAN. Less is
       more in this scenario. While I recognize college students are
       adults and responsible for their actions, it is way to easy for
       them, at the ripe old age of 18 to take on more debt for education
       of questionable value.

       Cut Federal Financial Aid to students: quit making it so easy to
       spend $130,000 on a degree which will nab you a $30,000 a year job.
       If students can't afford to pay for the crazy college costs they
       will choose cheaper and just as good option (community colleges).
       Eventually, the big schools will see a drop in enrollment and lower
       their tuition rates-as long as the financial aid noose is there,
       universities will show them the way to put that rope around their
       neck.

       maybe he can tell us that he could have been one of the three
       shooters who gunned down the very very white australian or maybe
       one of em coulda been his son. Where is al sharpton and jesse
       jackson? My guess is that they are trying to figure out how to
       twist it so that its the white mans fault. and i find it funny how
       none of the media including cnn have mentioned that the teens oh my
       bad the children if ya wanna go the trevon route are black maybe if
       ya say that they are white/blacks you could get the racial
       indignation going again. Makes me sick

       @liberal_troll Did you even bother looking it up? There is no
       college where the average professor salary is 250K. My boss a
       'liberal professor' makes 60k a year, for a phd. My undergrad
       advisor made 115K to teach a job that if he were working for exxon
       would be paying 150-200K. My mother passed up a job teaching at a
       community college because it paid 2k a class...for the whole year.
       I don't think the money is necessarily going to salaries. Ignoring
       the fact that very few people make that much what would make them
       worth it? I worked for an Italian who researched among other things
       smart programs that are like the ones mechanics use to diagnose
       cars. Except it was for the navy and the program doesn't know whats
       under the hood in advance. It could figure out systems. It would
       allow the navy to design and test/simulate all the electronic
       components down to the last outlet in a carrier. That guy left the
       country to go teach at some institute in Germany that paid better.
       How many future jobs do you think that guy represented?

       1. High salaries driven by similar position in professions
       including atlhletics. If you want outstanding professors you have
       to meet the competition.
       2. Serious decline in state aid for many state institutions.
       Tuition has to make up the gap.
       3. Rising costs of utilities and services without discounts.
       4. Greater demand to fund those who qualify for financial aid.
       5. Graduate students expect full financial support. ie Medical
       education
       6. Look at how these factors have risen during the past 25 years

       Let's see if CNN is an actual news station. Is he going to ask
       about the assassination of the 22 year white kid in Oklahoma?

            Now you know CNN will not ask anything that might put him in a
            bad light. CNN has never done factual reporting or truthful
            interviews. They probably have given Obama a scripted list of
            questions, approved by his press secretary so they can be sure
            that he has time to word smith his answers. Unfortunately, the
            liberal community still believes in his hope and change from
            last term and now it is forward. News flash, if you are
            driving in a downward direction and you continue to go
            forward, you are still going down. Obama and the liberals are
            the literal iceberg that is sinking this country.

            Hope he asks some hardball questions and not soft ones like
            MSNBC or other obama news stations, e.g., don't much care how
            many dogs they have now. Oh & I like FNC & think CNN is coming
            up a close second to demanding truth from the present
            administration.

       lower college costs? the first thing he will have to do is tell the
       liberal professors to cut their salaries, which they wont do
       some make 250 k a year and have one or two classes a year. They
       have no regard for struggling students only themselves and their so
       called Status as a professor...Obama is one of them, nothing will
       change..

            @liberal disease.
            You couldn't be further from the truth. First, the average
            college professor starts at $60,000, with the average salary
            being approximately $82,000 and any that make more than
            $110,000 are in the top 20% of their profession. The real
            world pays far more than theorizing... Second, some of the
            most conservative people you will meet are B-school profs, but
            hey, don't let facts get in the way of a perfectly good rant!

                 @Justin Cider, Apparently you must be speaking of some
                 community college in some podunk little town. Try FAU or
                 any other University in America and you will find they
                 make no less than $150,00 and Lib was correct, they only
                 work 1 or 2 days a week..
