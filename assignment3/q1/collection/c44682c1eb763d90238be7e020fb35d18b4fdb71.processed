[24]The 2020 redistricting battle begins in 2014

   Map of redistricting mechanism in the United States
   2010 was bad for many reasons, but perhaps worst among them was the
   boost it provided to GOP efforts to use gerrymandering to delay their
   slide into political irrelevance.

   The GOP picked up 63 seats in the House and six in the Senate. And that
   was horrible. But the real damage was done at the state level, where
   they picked up 680 state legislative seats and 29 of the 50
   governorships, including in key states such as Ohio, Florida, Michigan
   and Pennsylvania. They also held absolute control in half the state
   legislatures.

   Thus, Republicans were able to not just solidify their control of the
   House, where they maintain a 33-seat advantage despite losing the House
   popular vote by one point in 2012, but they locked in control of myriad
   state legislatures. And you can just scroll down this site to see the
   damage those wingnut legislatures are wreaking across the country.
   Thus, we can't allow a repeat of 2020. Republicans are on the wane. The
   only way they can retain power is via voter suppression or
   gerrymandering. We must deny them both those options.

   As you can see with [30]this map, most states still redistrict via
   state legislatures, subject to a governor's veto. We have found the
   last few cycles that when a state deadlocks on drawing boundaries, a
   fair map designed by judges ends up benefiting Democrats, and even if
   it doesn't, fair is fair. So gaining the ability to merely block a map
   is generally a net gain for us.

   Winning back heavily gerrymandered state legislatures is not always
   impossible, but is far more difficult than merely winning back
   governorships. So how are races in 2014 relevant to 2020? It's all
   about the power of incumbency.

   Learn more about the power of incumbency below the fold.

   We all know the power of incumbency, how elected officials are more
   likely to retain power than lose it at the hands of a challenger. So
   it's simple: Democrats retaking GOP-held seats in 2014 will run for
   re-election in 2018 with all the advantages of incumbency, and will be
   in office during the 2020 redistricting process (which actually happens
   in 2021, after census numbers are released).

   And we're not talking just any governors, but governors of the most
   blatantly gerrymandered states: Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania
   and Wisconsin. Texas, even, if you want to be extra optimistic. (North
   Carolina, another brutal gerrymander, won't be up until 2016.)

   In Michigan, Republicans hold nine of 14 seats despite losing the state
   at the presidential level by 9.5 points.

   In Wisconsin, Republicans hold five of eight seats despite losing the
   state by six points at the presidential level.

   In Pennsylvania, Republicans hold 13 of 18 seats despite losnig the
   state by about 5 1/2 points at the presidential level.

   In Florida, Republicans hold 17 of 27 seats despite narrowly losing the
   state at the presidential level.

   In Ohio, Republicans hold 12 of 16 seats despite losing the state by
   three points at the presidential level.

   (And hey, Virginia is outside the scope of this piece because its
   governors don't get to run for re-election, but Republicans hold eight
   of 11 seats despite losing the state by four points at the presidential
   level. And North Carolina, where Mitt Romney won narrowly, Republicans
   hold nine of 13 seats.)

   We don't want to wait until 2022 to retake the House, and hopefully we
   won't. But we won't see a House that reflects the nation until we have
   rationally drawn districts. And we won't see that until we erase these
   gross gerrymanders.

   Consider this: If the states listed above had 50-50-ish delegations,
   Democrats would gain 14 of the 17 seats they need for the majority. And
   given most of those states' politics, they shouldn't even be 50-50.

   Those aren't the only states where the House delegation doesn't
   accurately reflect the state's partisan leanings. Those aren't the only
   governorships that matter. But they headline a year in which the battle
   for state houses truly matters far beyond the states themselves.
   Indeed, they'll have a serious impact on the shape for Congress well
   into the 20s.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [56]Civil
   Rights, [57]Community, [58]Congress, [59]Culture, [60]Economy,
   [61]Education, [62]Elections, [63]Energy, [64]Environment, [65]Health
   Care, [66]International, [67]Labor, [68]Law, [69]Media, [70]Meta,
   [71]National Security, [72]Science, [73]Transportation, or [74]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([75]California, [76]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       The DNC will always be too Washington centered.
       Except following the Dean coup the DNC will be thinking about
       control in Washington.
       We need to take charge of making sure our state representatives
       win.
       Instead of fund raising for Senate and House at Dailykos, we should
       always be raising money for state races.
       In the "national" races are money doesn't mean much, but a little
       money goes a long way in a down ticket race.

   by 2016 we should be able to dent the GOP house significantly, and the
   effects of gerrymandering may lessen by then due to the fact that
   people move and gerrymandering is more effective at the beginning of
   the decade it is enacted in than at the end of that decade.

   Getting the House back is crucial, but I have no reason to believe that
   the GOP won't keep repeating the same mistakes they've made since 2008.
   Over the last few elections cycles all but 2010 went badly against the
   GOP, whereas 2006, 2008 and 2012 were clearly Dem cycles. The GOP is
   more unpopular than ever, their 2016 primary fights look to be a repeat
   of the bizarre 2012 primaries and beyond 2016 I don't see what the GOP
   has to offer.

   My point is, it gets better, but we still have to fight like hell.

 Something you have to bear in mind ([302]0+ / 0-)
       Democrats increasingly gerrymander themselves, into major
       metropolitan areas. The 'gerrymandering is more effective at the
       beginning of the decade' thing is not as large an effect as you
       think, because it has this fighting against it. I would be very
       surprised, absent a huge political realignment, if we did much
       better in 2016 than we did in 2012.

   ... right after the 2008 election. It can be seen here on DK,
   reflective of the larger society. The biggest numbers, by far, for
   "last commented" on this site are November & October 2008.

   That, and the Party's unwillingness to engage (very much including the
   Executive branch), made 2010 look like trouble early on. Much of the
   energy here was spent arguing about the President. Very few of us paid
   much attention to Congressional races, much less anything on the state
   level.

   Damned shame it was. I wonder if we'll do any better going forward.

       we were well-positioned for redistricting. Then came the 2010
       debacle. Of course, every cycle is important, but it seems a bit of
       a stretch to say that '14 will have a big impact that will still be

       Redistricting based on new demographics of people moving in and
       moving out of areas is required to adjust the number of
       representatives at the national level and at most state levels.
       Because redistricting happens the year after a census, it is
       critical to have Democratic incumbents in place ahead of time to
       assure that Democrats are in control when the maps are re-drawn.

       We are all in this together.

       The census is more that six years away now. We had lots of
       incumbents in place going into the 2010 election. It didn't protect
       us very much. How much less will it help us in the 2020 elections
       to get people in place next year.
       Of course, it's always a good idea to get Dems in whenever we can.
       The damage that Republican legislatures are inflicting on the
       nation right now from day-to-day is incalculable. But to talk about
       2014 as preparation for 2020 seems a little tenuous to me.

   more in 2014 and do our darnest to take back the House and retain the
   Senate.  I know it's a long haul, but with the GOP kicking voters every

       I missed out on all the ads because I live in Texas, a non-swing
       state of deepest Red, no reason to spend DNC money here.  The DNC
       ad $$ were wisely spent in swing states because of the weirdness of
       our electoral college.  So I understand why they did it during a
       national election.
       During a mid-term, I see individual candidate ads paid by the
       candidates committee but rarely the DNC.  I'd like to see the DNC
       place more ads for Texas Democrats.
       And your idea for the DNC to put out a pro-Democrat message would
       be very helpful to change Red states into at least purple and
       ultimately Blue.

       The question is whether the state and natl democratic party will

       I admire her, I would rather have her run against John Cornyn (or
       who ever they put up on the tea party side to primary him - I heard
       Louie Gohmert ha! ha!).  I think she would make a wonderful US
       Senator and she would be in an arena where she can make effective
       change and where others have her back.   If she runs for Governor
       (a rather weak political office in Texas other than the PR
       generated) she will be surrounded by an entrenched Republican
       machine that will hamstring her every effort and spin it to their
       benefit (ala Obama with a Repubican House).  Not sure I want her
       talents wasted or abused in the Governors Seat.
       There is a rumor in Houston that a Democrat from the area may step
       up to run but no word on who that could be.  It could be Bill White
       again, but I haven't seen any indication that might be true.  I'd
       vote for Bill White again; I think he would make an excellent
       governor.  It could also be Senator Rodney Ellis.  Nobody knows
       yet.  This rumor came out in a Burnt Orange tidbit about an
       anonymous person hiring a campaign fund raiser and driver in

       The first thing they do is make sure non-partisan redistricting is

       Putting it in the constitution in NC is relatively easy, the
       legislature votes to put it on the ballot and the people vote to
       approve.
       I would think that would pass overwhelmingly and would be very hard

       written in their redistricting laws already.  But then they start
       arguing about why maps are fair or not fair down partisan lines.
       In Texas, the Attorney General basically admitted that
       re-districting was done to dilute the Democratic power in the
       state.  In the DOJ lawsuit that Holder recently initiated against
       Texas for Voter ID and unfair Re-districting, the AG said that
       their intent in drawing the maps was not based on race, it was
       based on ideology, they don't care if Blacks vote, they just don't
       want Democrats to vote.
       The thing is, the Texas AG has been fighting the DOJ for the last
       47 years because they were under judicial review for past Jim Crow
       violations.  All of the AG's arguments in their defense during
       those 47 started with saying what they did to voters had nothing to
       do with race. Once they were no longer under sanction after SCOTUS
       gutted the voting rights act this year, Texas kept singing the same
       verse: We're not racist!  That "error" caused them to lose sight of
       what they were being accused of and so they blurted out in their
       response: WE'RE NOT RACIST, WE DON'T WANT DEMOCRATS TO VOTE.
       Hook 'em Mr. Holder, and when you get finished with Texas, go get
       North Carolina.  Voter suppression is not a crime against any race
       or party, it's a crime against Democracy and hurts all of us,
       Black, White, Democrats and, yes, Republicans, too.

   determine the qualifications for electors/voters. There is no inherent
   Constitutional right to vote. The most we have is that states cannot
   take away the right to vote for a specific list of reasons. The Supreme
   Court has approved of many obvious gerrymanders.

   The Constitution also gives Congress authority to determine the
   qualifications for voters in Federal elections and otherwise regulate
   them. Republicans have mostly been able to block any actual
   Congressional action apart from the Voting Rights Act. The Help America
   Vote Act, HAVA, was no help, and in several ways a hindrance.

   Theoretically, voter suppression could cause reduction of
   representation in Congress, but that never happens. If we could do it,
   I would like to see representation based on the number of people
   voting, not Census data. That would give politicians a real incentive
   to increase rather than decrease turnout.

 Better idea: ([564]0+ / 0-)
       NO districting.
       Just proportional representation by party.
       It's high time we admit that party politics are real and an
       integral part of our system.  So just accept it.  Have the people
       vote for their party, based on party platform and the slate of
       candidates put up.  When the results are in, each party gets to
       send part of their slate based on percentage of votes garnered in
       the state.
       The best part: 3rd parties will have MORE representation as they
       don't have to win a district.  Just get at least 100/N percent of
       the votes across the entire state (where N is number of reps for
       the state; or 50%+1 if N=1).

   is progressive who don't want to participate in electoral politics
   because it is "morally compromising."  It is really frustrating at
   times.  The microlevels of politics like state legislative elections
   are too often ignored.  I know that it is much more exciting to work
   for a charismatic presidential candidate.  But the gruntwork in this
   country gets done at the state level.  We need to be fully as mobilized

   That's a big reason why we lose.
   When progressives run at the state or local level, a third to half of
   the movement doesn't show up to help. Too many issue groups are tax
   exempt so they can't be involved in campaigns. Then there's the
   self-righteous element who think a candidate has to agree with them
   100% on every issue or that only direct action will effect change. The
   third party crowd who spread nothing but cynicism are a big part of the
   problem because they discourage people from getting involved in
   campaigns for good Democrats. Corporations spend millions on elections
   because winning matters. It's a shame that so many cynics of the left

   I understand people are upset about a lot of issues. But this is the

   corporatism banksters war criminals etc only leads to failure in the
   future.

   We may not like a lot of the Dems we have in office now. But if we work
   on the grassroots level, win local elections, and most of all VOTE, we
   get better and fairer districts that allow us to elect better Dems in
   the future.

   We also help to eliminate some of the ridiculous districts that make
   horrible radical Republicans invulnerable to more reasonable Republican
   primary challenges.

   So we can agree to disagree on President Obama's legacy etc, but lets
   all agree to fight for and work to elect Dems in 2014 even if we have
   to hold our noses a little bit.

   When we stop putting leaders from the past up on pedestals and ignoring

   In NJ, we have a bipartisan commission, which meets to agree upon a

   pick (without alteration) one of the maps.  I think this is a pretty
   fair way to do things, but for the fact that the parties always seem to
   agree to keep the status quo for safe districts and throw their least
   favorite members to the wolves in post redistricting elections.

   I don't get the complaints about gerrymandering.  What we should be
   complaining about is our inability to win local races, as well.  The

   2010. There are some real advantages ahead for 2020 but focusing
   attention on 2014 will get us prepared for good things to come. First
   of all, 2020 will be a presidential year which will maximize the Dem
   turnout so that we don't get effects of a low turnout election with a
   motivated minority like 2010. By 2020, there should be enough movement
   in some key demographics that can take away some of the effects of 2011
   gerrymandering. If we can stoke up our base in 2014 and retake Ohio,
   Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida, and Pennsylvania, we'll be in good shape
   for the Presidential election in 2016. But, let's not forget about New
   Jersey this year. Dems are making a horrible mistake by supporting
   Christie. It makes no sense to reelect Christie when everyone knows
   that he's running for president in 2016. If he comes out of this year's
   election with a win, he WILL be the presumptive favorite for winning
   the GOP nomination. If he wins New Jersey this year, he could easily
   beat any Dem other than Hillary. If he becomes president, we'd have
   2010 all over again. You would see a massive rollback of every
   progressive effort enacted during the Obama Administration. Repubs are
   as strong, if not stronger than Dems by only controlling one branch of
   government as Dems were when hey controlled all three! Not to mention
   the fact that a President Christie would appoint federal and supreme
   court justices like Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Roberts---in other
   words, Dems would be set back at least 25 years if any Repub wins the
   presidency in 2016. Given these possibilities, why in heavens name
   would NJ Dems hand the GOP nomination to the only Repub candidate who
   could beat any Dem in 2016? For those who think that Hillary has a lock
   should remember 2008. Besides, Hillary will be 69 in 2016. She may
   decide not to run, her health might be bad (God forbid), or any number
   of things could happen to prevent her from running. On the other hand,
   if Christie were to lose to Buono, he would be denied the claim that he
   can win big in a blue state and he'd be largely out of the picture for
   3 years making it very difficult for him to win the Repub nomination.
   Hillary can easily beat any other Repub, but more importantly, Joe
   Biden, Martin O'Malley, Jack Markell, or some other Dem could be very
   competitive with anyone other than Christie and probably beat any of
   the other Repubs if Hillary doesn't run. Between now and November 5th,
   we should put everything into helping Dems in NJ realize what a
   terrible dilemma they put us in for 2016 if they reelect Christie. 2016
   could be a really big year for Dems if we win back OH, WI, PA, MI, and
   FL in 2014, and then win senate seats (in 2016 Repubs are defending far
   more Senate seats than Dems---many of them are winnable!) and the
   presidency. This all would set up 2020 nicely to win big at all levels
   of government in the presidential year. That year, Georgia, Indiana,
   West Virginia, NC, South Carolina, Texas, Missouri, and Arizona would
   all be in play for Dems, in addition to all of the states that Obama
   won in 2012 being that much bluer. 2020 is the optimal year to win in
   anticipation of the 2020 census and allow Dems to draw more reasonable
   legislative districts in 2021. Everyone---please help our fellow Dems
   in NJ see what is at stake with the Christie/Buono election!

 Consider Wisconsin and Minnesota ([735]0+ / 0-)

   Two Midwest states, about the same size, situated next to each other.
   Both have a liberal history, but notable conservatives coming from a
   playing field than is more even than appears in presidential politics.

   Scott Walker won the governorship while Republicans took over both
   legislatures in Wisconsin.  With the trifecta in place, Walker shredded
   workers' rights, attacked women's rights, and signed a thoroughly
   gerrymandered electoral map.  Walker's agenda isn't overly popular, but
   he has the legislatures there to provide support and cover.  Democrats
   couldn't seize control of either legislature  because of gerrymandering
   and Walker looks tough to beat in 2014.

   Meanwhile, Republicans took over both legislatures in Minnesota in
   2010, but Mark Dayton defeated a hard-right TEA party candidate by
   6,000 votes.  Dayton vetoed a partisan gerrymander, vetoed a voter
   suppression bill, and a regressive tax plan.  With fair lines (and a
   presidential election), a couple of Republican scandals, and good
   candidates, Minnesota restored their Democratic majorities in the
   legislature.

   As a bonus, it appears that Minnesota's economy is doing better than
   Wisconsin.  Dayton looks to be a big favorite to be re-elected and the
   Democratic majority probably will survive the off-year 2014 elections.

 Good synopsis of the sister states. ([738]0+ / 0-)
       This progressive wonders if he is better off joining others he
       knows in moving 200 miles to the west, into Minnesota.  The states
       are generally so similar (minus professional football allegiances),
       however politically we are currently now polar opposites.

 Gerrymandering ([742]0+ / 0-)

   This is a wonderful article, but it would be helpful for illustrating
   the effects of gerrymandering, IMO, if you could also provide, for each
   of the states you cited, the total congressional democratic vote vs
   republican vote, compared to the number of seats secured by each party.
   That will show more directly how unequal people's votes are.

 The SCOTUS said we can redistrict mid decade ([745]0+ / 0-)

   both Texas and Georgia have done this. If we retake some of these
   states that don't outright ban mid decade redistricting we should just
   do it.

 Districting itself is the problem ([748]0+ / 0-)

   You can't stop gerrymandering.  In fact, there is such a thing as
   "natural gerrymandering" due to the tendency of urban areas being
   densely packed.

   Also, because of that, and the fact you have suburb and exurb rings,
   you can gerrymander things that even look natural.  Do you pie-slice
   the urban area?  How big are the slices, and how much sub/ex ring to
   they get?  Just enough to crack them?  Or large enough to pack the
   urban area?  Both look natural but give you very different results.

   If the idea is that numbers of reps should reflect numbers of voters by
   party, then just do it that way!.  Proportional representation.

   You vote for your party's full slate of candidates.  When all the state
   votes are tallied, each party selects a subset of their slate to go off
   to DC based on the percentage of votes they got.  Get 30% of the vote,
   you get 30% of the reps, so 30% of your slate is chosen.

   Bonus: 3rd parties get more representation!

 Important correction. ([751]0+ / 0-)

   The redistricting battle actually begins in 2013, not just with the
   governor's race in the crucial, "purple" state of Virginia, but also
   with the ENTIRE VIRGINIA HOUSE OF DELEGATES up for grabs. No wonder why
   [752]Howard Dean and DFA are heavily involved in Virginia this year (as
   are [753]billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, Planned
   Parenthood, NARAL, you name it)- they get it!  Note: right now, despite
   Barack Obama winning Virginia twice, and despite having TWO Democratic
   U.S. Senators, Virginia has a Congresssional delegation that's 8-3
   Republican, thanks in part to gerrymandered/incumbent protection
   districts. Also, the Virginia House of Delegates currently has 68
   Republicans out of 100 members, including 18 Republicans holding down
   districts that Tim Kaine and/or Barack Obama won in 2012.  That all
   needs to change.
