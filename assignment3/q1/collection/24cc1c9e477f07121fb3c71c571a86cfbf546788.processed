[22]Open thread for night owls: Celebrated and excoriated, Bradley Manning
now faces a century in prison

   Joe Coscarelli writes on the Tuesday acquittal of Bradley Manning on a
   charge of "aiding the enemy" and his [29]conviction on 19 counts of
   espionage:

       Three years after he was first charged with leaking classified
   government material, following eight weeks of testimony and three days
     of deliberation, a military judge found Bradley Manning not guilty
   today of "aiding the enemy," a capital offense, but guilty of nineteen
    lesser counts for violating the Espionage Act. Despite the surprising
     outcome--even his most ardent supporters were pessimistic--Manning
     could still face more than 100 years in prison during a sentencing
    phase that will include more witnesses for both sides and could take
      weeks. Manning's fate was decided by Col. Denise Lind in a court
             martial after he waived his right to a jury trial.

    The 25-year-old soldier and WikiLeaks associate had previously agreed
   to plead guilty to 10 of the 22 charges, which carry up to twenty years
      in prison, but the government pushed forward with the "aiding the
      enemy" case anyway, arguing that some of the 700,000 documents he
        leaked were obtained by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. (A full
    [30]breakdown of the charges is here.) According to the prosecution,
               "He was not a whistleblower; he was a traitor."

   In an earlier version of the Washington Post [31]story about the case,
   this paragraph, now heavily edited, appeared:

   The government relied on a case from the Civil War to bring the charge:
      In that trial, a Union Army private, Henry Vanderwater, was found
       guilty of aiding the enemy when he leaked a Union roster to an
    Alexandria newspaper. Vanderwater received a sentence of three months
                 hard labor and was dishonorably discharged.

   In a [32]post-conviction comment, CitizenOfEarth gave us a different
   bill of particulars:

                          Leaked Documents Summary:

          1. There is an official policy to ignore torture in Iraq.
        2. There is an official tally of civilian deaths in Iraq and
                                Afghanistan.
     3. Guantanamo prison has held mostly innocent people and low-level
                                 operatives.
      4. The State Department authorized the theft of the UN Secretary
                               General's DNA.
    5. The U.S. Government withheld information about the indiscriminate
        killing of Reuters journalists and innocent Iraqi civilians.
      6. The State Department backed corporate opposition to a Haitian
                              minimum wage law.
     7. The U.S. Government had long been faking its public support for
                         Tunisian President Ben Ali.
     8. U.S. officials were told to cover up evidence of child abuse by
                         contractors in Afghanistan.
   9. The Japanese and U.S. Governments had been warned about the seismic
                            threat at Fukushima.
    10. The Obama Administration allowed Yemen's President to cover up a
                     secret U.S. drone bombing campaign.
       11. Known Egyptian torturers received training from the FBI in
                             Quantico, Virginia.

   There's [33]another list here.

   Bradley Manning, 25, could obviously spend the rest of his life in
   prison if the sentencing is hard-nosed.

   Meanwhile, still free to roam the streets, take their book tours and
   collect their 5- and 6-digit speaking fees, is the cabal of scorpions
   that rationalized torture which they claimed was not torture, secretly
   rendered people off the streets of U.S. allies and secretly transported
   them to secret prisons in nations ruled by dictatorial regimes,
   fabricated evidence to take us into Iraq, where thousands of Americans
   and tens if not hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died in the conflict,
   conjured up a hell-hole at Guantánamo Bay, a place the attorneys
   created to be jurisdictionless--not quite the U.S., not quite Cuba--and
   thus free from both American and international law.

   No slam time for them. Not even an appearance before a truth and
   reconciliation commission. Not one minute of public penance or
   penitence.

   Bradley Manning versus Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleeza Rice
   and George Bush. A true tale of American justice.

   [34]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2010--Building a
   better people trap...:

    Like it or not, America post World War II was redesigned as a country
     for cars first, people second. We can all hope that will change and
   push for legislation that favors more variable use communities, better
   public transport, and urban renewal, but for many years to come there's
     going to be a need to shuffle people down the highway on a regular
           basis in areas where mass transportation is inadequate.

   So we better look at ways to do it more efficiently -- ways that do as
   much as possible to prevent repeats of the big disaster we're all still
    dealing with... the war in Iraq. Oh, and also that godawful mess from
                                     BP.

    This week there was some news on a couple of fronts when it comes to
     replacing our current generation of automobiles with something that
                          slurps up less petroleum.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [54]Tagging tips - [55]Search For Tags - [56]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [57]Civil
   Rights, [58]Community, [59]Congress, [60]Culture, [61]Economy,
   [62]Education, [63]Elections, [64]Energy, [65]Environment, [66]Health
   Care, [67]International, [68]Labor, [69]Law, [70]Media, [71]Meta,
   [72]National Security, [73]Science, [74]Transportation, or [75]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([76]California, [77]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 Senator McCain - Rehabilitating the Unredeemable ([80]20+ / 0-)

       Excerpt:

     There is no rehabilitation for the man who was touched by torture
     elsewhere but who would not pursue its practitioners here. The man
     who was tinged by corruption earlier but who would not complete
     campaign finance reform later. The man who's son graduated from the
     United States Naval Academy but who would deny other patriotic sons
     - soldiers - their own higher education. The man who married his own
     personal stimulus program but who would see those in the middle
     class deprived of even the most meager one of their own. The man who
     knows the horror of war but who would have it as his default foreign
     policy position.

     There is no rehabilitation for the man who once scorned "agents of
     intolerance" only to invite one of intolerance's most hideous agents
     to lead a nation with him.

       He was one of the sniveling cowards who swift-boated John Kerry in
       2004. He was also a virulent anti-Muslim bigot on top of everything
       else, indicting an entire religion based on the actions of a small
       group of extremists.
       Nice chap that Bud Day.

       Just because a war criminal is dead does not mean we can't bring up
       why he/she was convicted of being a war criminal.
       Otherwise, we couldn't have historians ascribing culpability for
       war crimes to  their perpetrators, regardless of whether they were
       seen as such in their time.
       Just because Dick Cheney is not officially dead yet doesn't mean we
       can't talk about his war crimes.  Just because George W. Bush (the
       lessor) is not yet physiologically dead yet doesn't mean we can't
       diagnose him as a War Criminal.

     Bud Day died
     He was one of the sniveling cowards who swift-boated John Kerry in
     2004.

   Let's read a bit about that sniveling coward...
   [192]http://www.washingtonpost.com/...

     George E. "Bud" Day, an Air Force fighter pilot who received the
     Medal of Honor for his valor during 51 / 2 years as a prisoner of
     war in Vietnam

     Col. Day was described in news accounts as one of the most highly
     honored military officers in U.S. history. In addition to the Medal
     of Honor, he received some 70 military decorations, including the
     Air Force Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star,
     the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross and multiple
     awards of the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart and the Air Medal.

     On Aug. 26, 1967, he was a 42-year-old Air Force major and father of
     four when his supersonic jet fighter came under fire over North
     Vietnam. Forced to eject, he suffered a broken arm, a knee injury
     and the loss of sight in one eye. He was swiftly captured, he
     recalled years later, by adversaries including a teenager armed with
     a rusty gun.

     "I hit the ground real hard," Col. Day once said, "and when I woke
     up, they had me."

     After interrogation and torture that included a mock execution and
     suspension from his feet, Col. Day enticed the guards to "relax
     their vigilance," according to his Medal of Honor citation. He
     escaped his captors and began making his way toward South Vietnam,
     sustaining himself on little more than berries and uncooked frogs.
     At one point, he was wounded again by shrapnel.

     Despite his injuries, Col. Day arrived at the demilitarized zone.
     After wandering for a number of days -- a consequence of delirium --
     he spotted helicopters that were evacuating U.S. Marines. He arrived
     at the landing area just after the helicopters took off, according
     to an account in the book "Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond
     the Call of Duty." The next day, he was recaptured by the enemy in
     an ambush.

     The Medal of Honor citation described Col. Day as "totally
     debilitated and unable to perform even the simplest task for
     himself" and credited him with answering interrogation questions
     with false information. He spent five years and nearly seven months
     in North Vietnamese prisons including Hoa Lo -- more commonly known
     as the Hanoi Hilton -- and one dubbed the Plantation.

     when armed guards barged in on the inmates during an illegal
     religious observance, Col. Day led prisoners including Stockdale in
     singing the national anthem.

   Perhaps you would care to tell us why you think Bud Day was a coward?

   Or maybe you can tell us how you think you would match up against him.
    I seriously doubt you are fit to scrape dog shit off his shoes.

 Just demonstrates the old adage... ([196]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [197]lyvwyr101

       ..."A lifetime of good deeds overthrown by one bad act."
       In general, I'm unimpressed by bravery.  Yes, it is often
       associated with selfless acts toward others, but it is in reality a
       "neutral" attribute.  For every brave act by a "good guy," I can
       come up with epic bravery by an evil person.  American popular
       culture doesn't do a very good job at revealing this fundamental
       truth: the bad can be brave.  The bad can be smart.  Beauty can
       hide evil intent.  This may or may not have relevance to Col. Day.
       The swiftboating of Kerry was a bad act.  The promotion of

       Do you have any specific allegations?
       There is no question that at least some of Kerry's claims were
       incorrect or embellished.  In particular, he himself walked back
       his Christmas in Cambodia claim.
       [255]http://en.wikipedia.org/...

     One chapter of SBVT's Unfit for Command questioned Kerry's
     statements that he was in Cambodia during the war. Kerry did not
     claim to have been sent on a covert mission to Cambodia on Christmas
     Eve, 1968. Rather, he believed at the time he had crossed the border
     while on a patrol near the border, during which the boats were
     ambushed and later came under friendly fire from South Vietnamese
     soldiers.[45][65] None of Kerry's crewmates confirmed being sent to
     Cambodia. One of Kerry's crewmen, SBVT member Steven Gardner,[66]
     asserted that it was physically impossible to cross the Cambodian
     border, as it was blocked and patrolled by PBRs (a type of patrol
     boat);[67] however, Kerry's boat was evidently patrolling with PBRs
     during the mission in question.[68] Some crewmembers have, moreover,
     stated that they may at some point have entered Cambodia without
     knowing it. James Wasser, who was on PCF-44 on that December
     mission, while saying that he believed they were "very, very close"
     to Cambodia, did not recall actually crossing over; he also stated
     that it was very hard to tell their exact position in the border
     area. Kerry's own journal entry on this, written the night of the
     mission, does not specifically say they entered Cambodia. However,
     it does state that PCF-44 was somewhere "toward Cambodia" to provide
     cover for two smaller patrol boats, and in sarcasm, that he
     considered messaging Christmas greetings to his commanders "from the
     most inland Market Time unit" and that a court martial for the
     incident "would make sense"[68] In addition, George Elliott noted in
     Kerry's fitness report that he had been in an ambush during the 24
     hour Christmas truce, which began on Christmas Eve.[69]

     Michael Meehan, a spokesman for the Kerry campaign, responded to
     SBVT's charges with a statement that Kerry was referring to a period
     when Nixon had been president-elect and before he was inaugurated.
     Meehan went on to state that Kerry had been "deep in enemy waters"
     between Vietnam and Cambodia and that his boat came under fire at
     the Cambodian border. Meehan also said that Kerry did covertly cross
     over into Cambodia to drop off special operations forces on a later
     occasion, but that there was no paperwork for such missions and he
     could not supply dates.[70]
     Based on examination of Kerry's journals and logbook, historian
     Douglas Brinkley placed the covert missions soon after Christmas. In
     an interview with the London Daily Telegraph, Brinkley stated that
     Kerry had gone into Cambodian waters three or four times in January
     and February 1969 on clandestine missions, dropping off U.S. Seals,
     Green Berets, and CIA operatives. Brinkley added, "He was a ferry
     master, a drop-off guy, but it was dangerous as hell. Kerry carries
     a hat he was given by one CIA operative. In a part of his journals
     which I didn't use he writes about discussions with CIA guys he was
     dropping off."[71][72]
     In an interview with Tim Russert on "Meet the Press," Kerry
     corrected his 1979 statement about being "five miles across the
     border" on Christmas Eve, but reiterated that he was on a patrol at
     the border at that date and had been sent on a covert mission at a
     later date.[73]

     who were drunk and celebrating Christmas. The absurdity of almost

       And as a former Marine, if I ever run across his grave site I'm
       going to piss on it.
       Here are just some of the right wing Swift Boat lies about Kerry,
       that were debunked long ago:

     ¾In the first Swift Boat ad, then-Clackamas County (Oregon) senior
     deputy district attorney Alfred J. French announced: "I served with
     John Kerry. ... He is lying about his record." In preparation for
     the ad, French signed a sworn affidavit for the Swift Boat Veterans
     asserting that Kerry had received his Purple Heart "from negligently
     self-inflicted wounds in the absence of hostile fire." A fundamental
     requirement of any affidavit is that the person signing it must have
     personal knowledge of the matters involved. The affidavit French
     signed declared, "I do hereby swear, that all facts and statements
     contained in this affidavit are true and correct and within my
     personal knowledge and belief" (emphasis added).

     But in an interview with The Oregonian, French freely admitted he
     had no firsthand knowledge of the events surrounding Kerry's medals
     and that his information came secondhand from "friends."
     ¾George Elliott was Kerry's former commanding officer in Vietnam
     and, in early 2004, told USA Today he had no qualms about Kerry's
     actions that earned him the Silver Star in Vietnam. "This was an
     exemplary action," he said. "There's no question about."
     Elliott then flip-flopped and claimed in the Swift Boat ad that
     "John Kerry has not been honest about what happened in Vietnam."
     Elliott then flip-flopped again when, just days after the first
     Swift Boat ad aired, he confessed to The Boston Globe that his
     involvement in the Kerry attack was "a terrible mistake" and said,
     "I'm the one in trouble here. ... I knew it was wrong. ... In a
     hurry I signed [an affidavit] and faxed it back. That was a
     mistake."
     But Elliott flip-flopped yet again -- days later, he announced that
     he stood by claims that Kerry "had not been honest" about Vietnam.
     ¾Dr. Louis Letson appeared in the first Swift Boat commercial and
     announced, "I know John Kerry is lying about his first Purple Heart,
     because I treated him for that injury." In another affidavit, Letson
     claimed Kerry's wound was too small to justify a medal.
     But Navy guidelines during the Vietnam War for Purple Hearts did not
     take into account the size of the wound when awarding the honor,
     which meant Letson's claim was irrelevant. Also, Kerry's medical
     records indicate Letson did not sign off as the "person
     administering treatment" on the night of the injury, which raised
     doubts about whether Letson ever even treated Kerry.
     ¾During the 2004 campaign, retired Cmdr. Adrian Lonsdale claimed
     that Kerry "lacks the capacity to lead." But during Kerry's 1996
     Senate race, according to reports from ABC News and the Air Force
     Times, Lonsdale lauded Kerry's bravery during Vietnam: "It was
     because of the bravery and the courage of the young officers that
     ran boats ... the swift boats and the Coast Guard cutters, and
     Senator Kerry was no exception."
     Also in 1996, Lonsdale explained to reporters that Vietnam War
     medals were only awarded if battle events were corroborated by
     others. His explanation completely contradicted later claims by the
     Swift Boat Veterans that Kerry won his awards only because he was
     able to write up false reports and fool his commanders.
     ¾Navy Lt. Larry Thurlow commanded a Navy Swift boat alongside
     Kerry's in Vietnam. As late as April 2004, Thurlow told USA Today
     that Kerry "was extremely brave, and I wouldn't argue that point."
     By August, though, Thurlow had publicly disputed Kerry's Bronze Star
     and third Purple Heart, won during a mission in Viet Cong-controlled
     territory on March 13, 1969. Thurlow claimed Kerry's award was a
     fraud. Thurlow signed a sworn affidavit for the Swift Boat Veterans
     stating that Kerry was "not under fire" when he pulled Lt. James
     Rassmann out of the water that day. He described Kerry's Bronze Star
     citation, which stated that all units involved came under "small
     arms and automatic weapons fire," as "totally fabricated." The Swift
     Boat Veterans also accused Kerry of "fleeing the scene."
     But when The Washington Post got a hold of the citation for a Bronze
     Star that Thurlow won that very same day for actions on a boat that
     was right alongside Kerry's, the citation detailed how both his boat
     and Kerry's boat faced "enemy small arms and automatic weapons
     fire." Asked for a response, Thurlow still insisted there had been
     no enemy fire that day. If true, that meant Thurlow knowingly
     accepted a Bronze Star that he did not deserve since he did not face
     enemy fire.
     ¾Upset by what he was hearing about the Swift Boat allegations
     regarding Kerry's Bronze Star, and that he did not deserve it
     because he was not under enemy fire, Jim Russell, a witness to the
     event, wrote to The Daily Planet of Telluride, Colorado, to dispute
     the Swift Boat Veterans' claims: "Forever pictured in my mind since
     that day over 30 years ago [is] John Kerry bending over his boat
     picking up one of the rangers that we were ferrying from out of the
     water. All the time we were taking small arms fire from the beach."
     ¾Like Thurlow, Swift Boat leader and Unfit for Command co-author
     John O'Neill was emphatic that Kerry didn't deserve his Bronze Star
     medal for saving Rassmann out of the Bay Hap River because Kerry
     wasn't under enemy fire. As proof, O'Neill told Fox News, "There's
     not a bullet hole in any of those three boats, not one." In fact, a
     report on the battle damage to a boat that motored upriver alongside
     Kerry's on March 13, 1969, made reference to "three 30 cal bullet
     holes about super structure."
     During an August 11, 2004, appearance on CNN, O'Neill insisted,
     "[T]he people in our organization have no partisan ties." Nine days
     later, the Swift Boat Veterans unveiled a new commercial featuring
     Vietnam veteran Ken Cordier, who served at the time as a member of
     the Bush-Cheney '04 National Veterans Steering Committee. Cordier
     had also been selected to serve on the Bush administration's POW
     Advisory Committee.
     Five days after that, it was revealed that Benjamin Ginsburg, a
     legal adviser to the Bush-Cheney campaign, had also been advising
     the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.
     ¾Kerry's former commander, retired Adm. Roy Hoffmann told The Boston
     Globe in June 2003 that Kerry's Silver Star was the product of
     "guts" and that he "admire[d] that." The next year though, Hoffman
     helped form the Swift Boat Veterans group.
     According to a May 6, 2004, article in the Milwaukee Journal
     Sentinel, the former commander "acknowledged he had no first-hand
     knowledge to discredit Kerry's claims to valor and said that
     although Kerry was under his command, he really didn't know Kerry
     much personally." The next month, Hoffmann reiterated, "I did not
     know Kerry personally. I didn't ride the boat with him."

       Is US News & World Report lying?
       Did Nixon somehow become president before 1969 and then excise it
       from all the history books?
       There seems to be no question that Kerry at minimum made
       mis-statements about his service and entering Cambodia.

 I seriously doubt you are fit to wipe shit off ([315]0+ / 0-)

       I read your NYT article.  It says nothing about the letter Kerry
       wrote to the Herald and makes no claim that he was in Cambodia on
       Christmas Eve, 1968, at a time that Nixon was mysteriously
       president 25 days earlier than the history books record.

 There's a reason why anyone with a half a brain ([319]0+ / 0-)
       (not Republican assclowns like you) uses the word "liars" anytime
       the swift-boaters are brought up nowadays. The only people who are
       still stupid enough to buy any of the bought and paid for right
       wing bullshit that the swift-boat clowns were peddling are the low
       IQ Teabagger members of the  Republican base (you).
       I can't wait to piss on Bud Day's grave some day.

     Media Matters for America has extensively documented the falsehoods
     and smears regarding Kerry's military record that the Swift Boat
     Veterans for Truth spread in the six months leading up to the 2004
     presidential election. For instance, Unfit for Command (Regnery,
     2004), a book O'Neill co-authored, asserted that "Kerry was never in
     Cambodia during Christmas 1968, or at all during the Vietnam War"
     because "[a]reas closer than 55 miles from the Cambodian border in
     the area of the Mekong River were patrolled by PBRs, a small river
     patrol craft, and not by Swift Boats." However, as Media Matters
     noted, according to White House recordings, in 1971 O'Neill told
     President Richard Nixon that he himself had been in Cambodia and
     answered in the affirmative when Nixon asked if it had been on a
     swift boat.

     Numerous major print outlets that reported on the withdrawal of
     Fox's nomination, including the Associated Press, The Washington
     Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times, failed to note
     that the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign has been widely
     discredited. Three of these outlets described the group as
     "controversial," but did not offer the details of the "controversy"
     or note that the group's claims were repeatedly debunked:

   LIE THROUGH HIS TEETH.
   He is not a man to be admired.
   And remember, he was a "fly-boy", one of those guys who went up in
   planes, among crystal skies, to drop bombs and napalm on children and
   villages he never saw. Then it was back to the base and to the "O Club"
   for drinks and dinner.
   Vietnam was just slightly less heinous than Iraq.

 Which civil liberties were still left after Bush? ([504]0+ / 0-)
       Can you actually name them?  The 1st, 4th and 5th amendments were
       gutted under his Presidency.  I don't know which major federal
       civil rights were really left?
       However, I can name the civil liberties being taken away currently
       by the Republican Party at the state level: voting rights,
       reproductive rights and workers rights.
       Alas the 2nd amendment and 10th Amendments are safe so
       conservatives, libertarians and white males in general don't seem
       to mind.
       I don't see any of Obama's supporters turning a blind eye. Many did
       not turn up in 2010 as a protest to not jailing the Wall Street and
       Bush Era criminals. What did that give us the Tea Party radicals,
       who made neo-con era Republicans look almost quaint.
       Unfortunately, in a two party system the only real  alternative to
       the Democratic Party is the Republican Party.  At this point most
       Americans are aware that the GOP are hell bent on destroying the
       economy and the country.
       Obama and the Democrats are the only moderate alternative we have,
       despite their flaws.  Right now  Americans are worried about about
       bread and butter issues.  Feeding their families, paying for
       housing,  gaining access to healthcare, paying for education or
       just looking for gainful employment.

   If Manning receives any prison time as a result of his convictions, his
   sentence will stand in stark contrast to that of the servicemembers who
   have been involved in alleged U.S. war crimes. After the 2005 Haditha
   killings in Iraq, where 24 unarmed people died, the only marine to be
   tried received a reduction in rank and a pay cut.

   Widney Brown, senior director of international law and policy for
   Amnesty International, said in a statement that the aggressive
   prosecution of Manning showed the military's double standard on
   investigating incidents of its own misdeeds.

   "The government's priorities are upside down," Brown said. "The U.S.
   government has refused to investigate credible allegations of torture
   and other crimes under international law despite overwhelming evidence.
   Yet they decided to prosecute Manning who it seems was trying to do the
   right thing - reveal credible evidence of unlawful behavior by the
   government."

    He presumable would have stayed in jail if his friend Emerson had not
   paid the tax.  I understand that some people believe they have an
   ethical responsibility to break the law, and the heroes are those who
   do so and then abide by the consequences.  What so many had an issue
   with was the treatment of an American citizen during detention, not the
   presumed time he would serve for his actions.  By focusing on the jail
   time, we are implicitly accepting the torture.

   That said, the basic corruption of the military has to also be
   acknowledged.  Constitutionally it barely is a valid institution, and
   unlike agencies such as the IRS, there has been no attempt to create
   amendments that would make them constitutional.  Though the military,
   unlike the civilian population, has no rights and is under the direct
   control of the president, there is so much fear of the military that no
   one is brave enough to call them on even basic issues, such as they
   allow rapists to enjoy the full benefit of the service.  So of course
   officers do not feel any connection to the rule of law.  Why else would
   so many of them feel free to disregard orders from their commander in
   chief.

       ...all bets are off.
       When the government punishes the whistleblowers, but not the war
       criminals, all bets are off.
       As recently as Watergate, both parties were willing to uphold the
       rule of law. That is no longer the case. Today, neither party does.
       And given a lawless government, a whistleblower does not have the
       same obligation to face the consequences that whistleblowers in the
       past might have.

       Esquire's Charles Pierce on the terrifying "logic of

       state."
       "There are two ways in which any government can seek to control
       security leaks. The first is by honesty and transparency, by
       allowing the public to know enough to make democratic decisions
       about how far is too far. That is the path that the United States,
       and this president, claims to follow. The second is by threatening
       draconian consequences to anyone who exposes questionable policies
       and practices to the light of day. That is the path the United
       States, and this administration, has chosen with the prosecution of
       Bradley Manning and others."

     RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Harry F. Byrd Jr., a 20th century champion of
     racial segregation and fiscal restraint who followed his father into
     the U.S. Senate but left his father's Democratic Party, died
     Tuesday. He was 98.

     Byrd, whose genteel demeanor masked thundering political clout, was
     the archetypal Southern senator during his 17 years in Washington.
     His 1983 retirement amounted to an epilogue for the "Byrd Machine"
     which once dominated Virginia politics from courthouses to the

     Rand Paul: Chris Christie Is 'The King Of Bacon,' Not Serious About
     National Defense

     Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) fired the latest shot on Tuesday in an
     escalating feud with Chris Christie, calling the New Jersey Governor
     the "king of bacon," a reference to what Paul believes is a poor
     record on government spending.

     The comment came during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, during
     which Paul accused Christie of sucking up government funds for
     hurricane relief aid without pushing for offsets to expenditures
     like foreign aid. Paul also suggested that Christie was hurting the
     GOP by continuing to criticize Paul's positions on national
     security:

        It's not helping the party for him to pick a war with me. It's a
     big mistake. It's not very smart. And it's not a good way to grow
     the party. Why would he want to pick a fight with the one guy who
     has a chance to grow the party by appealing to the youth and
     appealing to people who would like to see a more moderate and less
     aggressive foreign policy?

     Paul's argument stems from a press conference earlier on Tuesday,
     during which Christie hit Paul for what he characterized as
     hypocrisy on the topic of Hurricane Sandy aid, and government
     spending more broadly:

        I find it interesting that Sen. Paul is accusing us of having a
     "Gimme, gimme, gimme" attitude toward federal spending when in fact
     New Jersey is a donor state and we get 61 cents back on every dollar
     we send to Washington. Interestingly, Kentucky gets $1.51 on every
     dollar they send to Washington.

       Cell Phone surveillance as a US Attorney
       [984]http://thinkprogress.org/...

     As U.S. Attorney, Chris Christie Approved Warrantless Tracking Of
     Suspects Using Cell Phone GPS

     While serving as a U.S. attorney during the Bush administration,
     Christopher Christie, now a Republican candidate for Governor in New
     Jersey, tracked the whereabouts of citizens through their cell
     phones without warrants. The ACLU obtained the documents detailing
     the spying program from the Justice Department in an ongoing lawsuit
     over cell phone tracking.
     While the documents reveal 79 such cases on or after Sept. 12, 2001,
     they do not specify how many of the applications were made during
     Christie's tenure. Christie served as U.S. attorney from Jan. 17,
     2002 through November 2008. ACLU staff attorney Catherine Crump
     noted:

        Tracking the location of people's cell phones reveals intimate
     details of their daily routines and is highly invasive of their
     privacy. The government is violating the Constitution when it fails
     to get a search warrant before tracking people this way.

   I think Manning received the best he could have hoped for.

   The military justice system is, for the most part, a kangaroo court.
   The fix was in before the trial ever started.

   It may be unfortunate (or not, depending on one's point of view) that
   Manning will spend a considerable portion of the rest of his life
   behind bars.  I am hopeful that as the years pass, and real truths
   about war crimes that transpired in Iraq and Afghanistan emerge, that
   Manning will be pardoned.

   As a veteran of a branch of the service that engaged in secret ops, I
   understand the damage from loose lips and paid-for informants.
   Manning, however, doesn't and never did fit the John Walker profile.

   While I'm conflicted about the verdicts, I feel like the judge did the
   best hair splitting possible in an impossible situation.  The end
   result is that Bradley Manning will be free sooner than later.

   Sedition by proxy or something (?)

     ..but the government pushed forward with the "aiding the enemy" case
     anyway, arguing that some of the 700,000 documents he leaked were

       ..so private school founder and wealthy GOP donor can continue
       siphoning off tax payer money away from public schools

     Indianapolis charter school run by a prominent Republican donor
     might receive a poor grade, Bennett's education team frantically
     overhauled his signature "A-F" school grading system to improve the
     school's marks.
       Christel Dehaan, founder of the private for profit  of `Christel
       House' has given more than $2.8 million to Republicans since 1998,
       including $130,000to Bennett and thousands more to state
       legislative leaders.

     Indiana uses the A-F grades to determine which schools get taken
     over by the state and whether students seeking state-funded vouchers
     to attend private school need to first spend a year in public
     school. They also help determine how much state funding schools
     receive.
       This is the doing of Former Indiana and current Florida schools
       chief Tony Bennett who built his national star by promising to hold
       "failing" schools accountable.
       Accountable - yeah right..to whom?  Certainly not the children in
       need of an education. Once again the GOP proves their central tenet
       of free market competition and stated goal of eliminating "waste
       fraud & abuse" is bullshit.
       And the constantly repeated allegation that public schools can't
       provide for the needs of future generations or compete with the
       excellence provided by a voucher system of private for profit
       schools is also a lie that actually harms children and public
       education.
        It's all about profit . And making sure rich donors get a return

 Wrong path--period- ([1083]0+ / 0-)
       Esquire's Charles Pierce on the terrifying "logic of
       authoritarians...pursued so vigorously by a putatively democratic
       state."
       "There are two ways in which any government can seek to control
       security leaks. The first is by honesty and transparency, by
       allowing the public to know enough to make democratic decisions
       about how far is too far. That is the path that the United States,
       and this president, claims to follow. The second is by threatening
       draconian consequences to anyone who exposes questionable policies
       and practices to the light of day. That is the path the United
       States, and this administration, has chosen with the prosecution of
       Bradley Manning and others."

   Daniel Horowitz writing on the front page of RedState has this to say
   in his diary about defunding ACA.

   [1155]Why We Always Lose, and the Need for 21st Century Conservatives

     We have two choices: we can continue funding Obamacare, only to find
     ourselves discussing modest tweaks to the law in 10 years from now -
     not unlike the way we are forced to approach Medicare now.  Or we
     can end the cycle of big government by forcing a fight to the death
     over this cancer to our country before it take effect.  It is that
     simple.  There are no other options.

   What the hell Horowitz?!?!

   Words have meanings. Is that really want you wanted to say? I suppose
   you are talking about some proverbial 'cross to die on' for the
   Republican Party, but not only is that a false dilemma, it is reckless
   rhetoric at the extreme.

   WTH Horowitz, is 'forcing a fight to the death' really all you want to
   offer to the debate on heath care in America? You most assuredly did
   not offer and other alternatives.

   is that their goal?

   Dirty Wars by Scahill describes how the neo cons were able to take
   decades of work and 9/11 and pull off a coup d'etat in the military and
   the intelligence arena

   they have been packing the courts for decades with people from the
   Federalist society of attorneys

   they are doing everything they can to block voting

   the Cold War was successfully morphed into the War on Terror and fear
   rules the land

   the essence of freedom is taken to be like the shopper with choices and
   this along with the chance to get filthy rich keeps people focused on
   the prize, not the commons

   so many people are just scraping by that they don't have time to
   understand politics and the economy

   institutions have been corrupted or taken over - education, etc.

   the commons is under attack from all quarters

   and we have seen that they don't care, they really don't care about
   people

   sad to say that politicians for the most part are bought and sold

   NSA has violated the constitution and the person who outed the crime is
   called a traitor

     Tuesday was an angry day in Weinerland.

     The campaign staff awoke to see their former intern, Olivia Nuzzi,
     on the front cover of the Daily News. Inside the paper was an
     article bylined by Nuzzi in which she told a rather unflattering
     tale of her experience working on Anthony Weiner's mayoral bid.

     Now, Team Weiner is firing back. TPM called Weiner's communications
     director Barbara Morgan to discuss an unrelated story Tuesday and
     she went off on a curse-filled rant about Nuzzi, describing her as a
     fame hungry "b*tch" who "sucked" at her job. Morgan also called
     Nuzzi a "slutbag," "tw*t," and "c*nt" while threatening to sue her.

       You're unhappy that the New York Times failed to go before the
       Judge and offer their corporate charter for sentencing instead of
       Bradley?
       Wikileaks received information from Bradley Manning and published
       much of it. What part of that transaction involved sacrificing
       their source?
       The decent life with a paycheck part, though, you're totally right
       about, since our government has no policy of harassing and
       detaining and stealing from Wikileaks members whenever they travel,
       and has done nothing in collaboration with the financial services
       industry to impinge the ability of their organization to collect
       and disburse funds. Very good point there.

 Indeed. Unlike the New York Times, which... ([1431]0+ / 0-)
       utilizes a model of discouraging people from providing it with
       classified information. The Times (or the Post, etc), which insists
       on only printing information released through legal means and
       refuses to publish classified information. The Times, which is
       known to have a strict policy of only communicating with illicit
       leakers for the purpose of informing them of the illegality of
       their conduct and encouraging them to get back to work.
       Yes indeed. Wikileaks is so unique that I bet it would take well
       over fifteen seconds to find an illegally leaked story if we hopped
       over to washingtonpost.com right now. It's certainly unlikely, but
       we might even have to scroll down a tiny bit to read the first
       story involving a source that was encouraged by the reporter to
       engage in illegal activity.

 Secrets are the norm... deal with it. ([1459]0+ / 0-)

   Now I am not a fan of the way our government has acted overseas and the
   whole NSA snooping matter. But I would like to say that the world is
   full of secrets and that's the reality we live in. Why does it have to
   be that way? The world would be a whole lot better without them you
   say?

   That is the hope of dreamers. Human beings are not honest, open and
   giving as a species. We hide secrets that would cause us harm or
   ridicule if divulged. Some for good reason. Some just because we did
   something stupid. Governments are no different. Secrets exist because
   it's how we cope with living together in this world. If everyone knew
   everything about each other we would likely understand each other
   completely, but some would likely be at each other's throats
   constantly.

   Governments protect those secrets that would cause the country great
   harm if divulged. People go to war for the most petty things. Some
   retaliate upon innocent citizens abroad because of something a country
   has done to wrong them. And some attack military personnel for abuses
   real or imagined from past generations. We need to keep some secrets
   and that is the way it's been for all time.

   Secret (we will never really know because of the secretive nature of
   the trial). Anyone who has worked in this community knows that
   Confidential stamps get applied to anything other than rosters. Secret
   is likely applied to most unconfirmed reports, but really contains
   nothing truly "secret" and usually can be found in Time or on-line.

   To be clear I worked in this world for a few years and on classified
   projects later and never leaked a damn thing. I do believe that Manning
   deserved some jail time, but that his sentence is excessive.

       in this country. When you need it it's non-existent. When you don't
       it's breathing down neck, hurling outrageous sentences on people.
       After Bradley Manning, I don't give two shits about this President,
       his corrupt fascist administration or this fraudulent "Democratic"
       Party. I'll support a real Democrat, but they can shove the

 Is there any justice in the US anymore? ([1537]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   Ans:  No!
   Is there anything we can do about this?

   Ans: Sure.  Anyone can protest and go to jail for the rest of their
   lives, just like Bradley.

   Alternative answer:  Refuse to take part in anything in this society.
   Gather in small, mutually supporting groups / tribes.  Divorce
   ourselves from participating in the insanity of this society!

   May blessings be!

 My main question... ([1541]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1542]lyvwyr101

   ...is something I've been asking ever since Barack Obama, the Commander
   in Chief of the military, pronounced Bradley Manning, in no uncertain
   terms, to be guilty of severe crimes.  He pronounced this when the
   information about Manning first came out.

   Since Manning is being tried in a military court, and since the supreme
   commander in chief of the military has pronounced his guilt, the
   military members in the trial cannot be free from prejudice.  The whole
   proceedure is tainted by the CIC's prejudgement of the defendant's
   guilt.

   Even if this is not a direct order from a superior officer, it would
   have a sublimely prejudicing effect on the court as a whole.  Would a
   career military person want to throw away a 20 year commitment, or risk
   no further promotions by deciding out of agreement with the Commander
   in Chief?  I think not.

   Ergo:

   Bradley Manning could not have possibly gotten a fair trial!

 The term 'ODS' ([1545]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1546]lyvwyr101

   short for 'Obama Derangement Syndrome,' being used perjoratively
   against critics of the Administration with increasing frequency.

   I'm going to start HRing it. It attempts to dismiss criticism as
   invalid by implying mental health issues.

   If Meteor Blades cares to weigh in, or advise against HRing this term,
   I would welcome his input.

 Manning should be freed, with time already served ([1572]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [1573]lyvwyr101

   let's face it, he did not give up a position on the battlefield to the
   enemy. He did not give any enemy information that would hurt a war or
   battle effort. he didn't nuclear secrets to the Russians in the Cold
   War.
   Nothing he did harmed the US in any way.
   What he DID do is expose truths and lies that had been kept from The
   People. The only harm that could come would be to our reputation as a
   nation who was supposedly against torture, was supposedly for the rule
   of law and who was supposed to uphold the truth.
   Manning exposed us as being no better than a third world dictatorship.
   And so now he can rot in prison.
   Which is what they do in third world dictatorships.

   If anyone things today's America is not different than yesterday's, I
   read comments by Daniel Ellsburg who said that when he leaked the
   Pentagon Papers he remained free. He could walk the streets a free man
   until whatever trial took place. Manning gets tossed in jail, even
   solitary confinement. This is justice?

   America, where have you gone?

       He was going to be convicted on at least some of the charges--good
       motivations or not, he broke the law. A member of the Armed Forces
       cannot just share classified documents with the world. Even if the
       damage was minimal and his motivations were not anti-American, he
       couldn't have known the details and implications of ALL the
       documents he shared.
       That said, I am glad he was found not guilty of the ridiculous
       aiding the enemy charge. I hope there is extreme leniency in
       sentencing under the circumstances, considering his intent and the
       effects. I think Manning will have to serve time, but I would
       really hate to see this man lose the better part of his life in
       prison over this.
