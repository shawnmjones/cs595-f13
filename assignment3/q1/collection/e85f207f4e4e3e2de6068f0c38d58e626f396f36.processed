The Sequester - The President's Plan

A Balanced Plan to Avert the Sequester and Reduce the Deficit
         ______________________________________________________________

       President Obama believes that our guiding focus must be growing the
       economy and strengthening the middle class. That's his North Star,
       and it's why he won't accept cuts that force the middle class to
       bear the burden of deficit reduction.
       The President has put forward a specific plan that will avoid
       sequestration's harmful budget cuts and reduce the deficit in a
       balanced way -- by cutting spending, finding savings in entitlement
       programs and closing tax loopholes.
       Both parties have already come together to cut the deficit by more
       than $2.5 trillion and today the deficit is coming down at the
       fastest pace since then end of World War II.
       President Obama's plan builds on this progress and would cut the
       deficit by another $1.5 trillion, bringing it below its historic
       average.
