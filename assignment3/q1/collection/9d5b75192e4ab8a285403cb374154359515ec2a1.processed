[22]This week in science: and Neo was its name-o!

   Neo

   No, not that Neo, Near Earth Objects., i.e., [29]dino killers, city
   busters, [30]Siberian dynamite. The House and Senate finally had a
   hearing on the danger posed by NEOs. The hearings weren't half bad, a
   round of bipartisan agreement almost broke out, and there was some talk
   of a [31]Sentinal chasing after a Neo  ...:

     The Silicon Valley-based B612 Foundation's plan to send an
     asteroid-hunting space telescope called the Sentinel into space in
     July 2018 would solve that problem, Green told the senators. "We
     have discovered 10,000 near-Earth asteroids thus far.... Sentinel
     will discover roughly that number every two weeks," said B612 chair
     Ed Lu, a former astronaut and another witness on the panel.
     "Assuming that we found one before you got your satellite up ...
     what would an asteroid that is a kilometer in diameter, what would
     it do if it hit the Earth?" asked subcommittee chair Bill Nelson
     (D-Fla.) .... "That is likely to end human civilization," Lu
     responded.

   Best of all, in my biased opinion, we were mostly spared the spectacle
   of a bunch of imbeciles who pissed away over a trillion dollars and
   counting on non-existent Weapons of Mass Destruction^tm lecture the
   experts and the nation about "wasting" a thousandth of that on WMDs we
   know exist to a 100 percent certainty.

   The full House Hearing on NEOs is [32]here, the Senate version is
   [33]here, the B612 Foundation and the Sentinel Telescope are described
   [34]here.
     * A [35]beautiful new image of the infant universe suggests it is a
       little older than we thought, but I still don't think it looks a
       day past 13.7 billion.
     * We may now have a [36]complete neander genome sequenced and ready
       for comparison, base pair by base pair, to anatomically modern
       humans.
     * I have no idea how to get in touch with [37]Seth MacFarlane, but it
       might be fun to talk to him about some space and science stuff. If
       anyone can forward my email, see first comment below.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [50]Tagging tips - [51]Search For Tags - [52]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     More than three years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks
     on the US, Bin laden released a videotape in which he staked out his
     ultimate goal; to bankrupt America.

     "We are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of
     bankruptcy, Allah willing. And nothing is too great for Allah," bin
     Laden said.

       [231]polls showed 54% of Americans in favor of invasion.
       But I'm also talking about support for the invasion of Afghanistan,
       which as we now know was just a set-up for the invasion of Iraq.
       Popular support for that invasion was an [232]overwhelming 87%.
       I remember, because I opposed both invasions. Let's not rewrite

 Yes, let's not rewrite American history. ([236]0+ / 0-)
       For starters, let's not cherry-pick a poll that showed a smidge
       over half agreed with it when it was a fait accompli as evidence
       that Americans are evil.
       Second, no, the "invasion" of Afghanistan - with the full support
       of the UN-recognized government, NATO, and with no objections by
       virtually any nation on Earth - was not part of the Iraq War plot,
       and was in fact something the Bush regime was forced to do (albeit
       halfheartedly) following 9/11 when they would much rather than have
       gone after Iraq.  And unless you're making Truther insinuations,
       going into Afghanistan was self-defense.

 Exactly what country's history are you using for ([245]0+ / 0-)
       comparison, by which to blood libel an entire nation as
       bloodthirsty savages?
       Michael Moore is an American too, and unlike you seems to interpret
       that as giving him certain responsibilities to make it a better
       place instead of just trying to make himself feel superior.  The
       same goes for too many brilliant, noble American luminaries of
       human progress and equality in history than I could practically
       list.  Furthermore, Daily Kos is an American website.  The internet
       on which we're having this discussion is an American invention,
       brought into widespread use largely via American entrepreneurship.
        You're welcome to see your way out of them all if you're serious
       about rejecting this country.
       Frankly, democracy would still be a fringe element among world
       governments without this country's historical influence - certainly
       in Europe - and you don't get to say that the most potent
       geopolitical advocate of liberal humanism in the history of the
       world is its chief enemy simply because you can identify anecdotes
       where politics and values were at odds.
       What you're saying does not reflect the lessons of history, but
       seems just to be a lazy, slanderous broadside against hundreds of
       millions of people based on an ignorant, bigoted, and
       ideology-driven agenda with no sense of its own moral or
       philosophical foundations.

 Actually, Moore's point was that white racism ([249]0+ / 0-)
       and white American genocide of native Americans created a culture
       in which whites are afraid of those they have oppressed, and cling
       to their guns and their violence out of their fear of retribution
       against them for their crimes.
       As for who I am -- I am a transgender woman who has barely survived
       the violence and bigotry I've received in this country. I have as
       much right to resent my oppression at the hands of heteronormative
       America as do other targets of American violence and oppression.
       America is not the most potent advocate of human rights on Earth --
       that would be Europe, by far. America is far behind Europe on every
       parameter of human welfare and human rights.

     America is not the most potent advocate of human rights on Earth --

       I was speaking of the entire scope of history, as you had
       originally been - only now you change the subject to this very
       moment.  Yes, at this instant, European governments have a better
       human rights record - or, at least, Western Europe and Scandinavia.
        And except for the whole thing about forcing vulnerable
       governments to adopt radical austerity programs.  And the countries
       that still don't have jury trials, or presumption of innocence, and
       have official religions and/or monarchies funded with taxpayer
       money, stringent laws restricting speech about the government, etc.
       etc.  There's also the minor fact that the only reason they don't
       have massive militaries is that they were under US protection for
       half a century, had completely destroyed themselves, and were
       rebuilt at US expense (not loans).  Yeah, your characterization is
       a tad selective and amnesiac.

     somewhere back in your youth, if you think America is as you paint
     it.
       So you're not on the American-invented and American-commercialized
       internet, on an American liberal political website, freely
       expressing yourself because of the American Constitution, and using
       all that to take a giant shit on America and say what terrible,
       inhuman, brutal people we are?

     Also, the web is a European invention -- invented at CERN.
       Yes, the World Wide Web is a European invention - and if it had
       stayed a European invention instead of being taken up by Silicon
       Valley, it would still be at CERN.  Instead its inventors went to
       the US and worked with DARPA to build it into something more, and
       it was subsequently seeded by US startup businesses.

     For that matter, science was a European invention.
       And by the 20th century, the form of that science was racial
       hierarchy, totalitarian economics, and the logistics of Total War.
        They've obviously learned from their mistakes, but the only reason
       they had a chance to is that one of their earlier inventions - the
       United States of America - rescued them from horrors this country
       has never even come close to committing, and have never gotten (or
       for that matter, needed) a similar level of assistance.

 This is absurd ([257]0+ / 0-)
       Nothing I said even remotely "denigrates the suffering" of
       transwomen in other countries.
       I am not a cheerleader for the US. It has a culture of violence and
       greed that goes far beyond anything in contemporary Europe or
       British Commonwealth countries, and Moore is right that this
       culture of violence is rooted in a brutal history of white
       Americans, a history of slavery and genocide. US violence hugely
       exceeds that in Europe or any of the Commonwealth countries -- just
       look at the statistics.
       As for the rest of the mindless jingoism you spout, it's not even
       worth responding to. Reagan is dead.
       You may have have infinite religious faith in the ability of
       "American technology" to bring about the Transhuman Era, or some
       such escapism from ecological limits -- but the fact is that
       American technology has proven to be the #1 threat to the survival
       of humanity. And again, its because of that same greed that lead
       white Americans to practice genocide and slavery. Humanity may very
       well die of American greed.

 You didn't answer my question. ([261]0+ / 0-)
       If you're going to use your experiences as a basis to attack the
       entire United States, you need to be able to argue convincingly
       that (a)you've experienced a broad of this country, and (b)other
       countries would have treated you better.  You haven't tried to do
       that.

     I am not a cheerleader for the US.
       Nor a convincing critic.  It's a little too obvious that nothing
       any American could say or do would alter your opinion of this
       country.  I don't like it when people treat me personally like
       that, and I'm no less disgusted by it applied to 5% of the entire
       human species.

     It has a culture of violence and greed that goes far beyond anything
     in contemporary Europe or British Commonwealth countries, and Moore
     is right that this culture of violence is rooted in a brutal history
     of white Americans, a history of slavery and genocide. US violence
     hugely exceeds that in Europe or any of the Commonwealth countries
     -- just look at the statistics.
       It does have a culture of violence and greed.  It also has a
       culture of compassion, innovation, and idealism, because the
       American people run the moral and intellectual gamut - but you
       don't seem especially interested in any aspect of our culture that
       doesn't confirm your attitude.  And that, in itself, is about the
       only convincing part of your argument - the fact that your own
       attitude exemplifies the ugliness you're criticizing.

       Your first sentence is ridiculous. I do not need to prove anything
       of the sort.
       But I will humor your madness, because it is quite easy to give a
       personal example: in Britain I would have had the NHS and the costs
       of transitioning would not have bankrupted me and put me on the
       street. And Britain has long been less homophobic than the US.
       And your imperial edict that I "am not a convincing critic" sounds
       like the usual marginalizing bigotry to me. Who appointed you
       Keeper of the Flame of Criticism? You don't even have a radio talk

 "I do not need to prove anything of the sort." ([269]0+ / 0-)
       That's right, you certainly don't.  I said "need" under the
       assumption that you were trying to be persuasive, and not just
       saying things to make yourself feel better.

     in Britain I would have had the NHS and the costs of transitioning
     would not have bankrupted me and put me on the street. And Britain
     has long been less homophobic than the US.
       Fair enough, at least about the second part - Britain's greater
       cultural openness in this respect.  The first part is a bit
       sideways, since the problem is that we don't have a public health
       system, not that what we do have discriminates against you.  So,
       you've convincingly shown that there is one other country on Earth
       where you would probably have experienced fewer problems.  Care to
       try for two?

     And your imperial edict that I "am not a convincing critic" sounds
     like the usual marginalizing bigotry to me. Who appointed you Keeper
     of the Flame of Criticism? You don't even have a radio talk show.
       Now you're just being silly.  There is no logical plane on which
       the phrase "unconvincing critic" and "imperial edict" occupy the
       same universe, let alone calling that "bigotry."  But I can't say
       I'm surprised to see what had begun as a careless, bigoted put-down
       of an entire nation degenerate into flailing and paranoia when
       challenged.  All I'm asking is that you put up some kind of effort
       to not scapegoat an entire nation for your negative experiences in
       life.

 Better ([273]0+ / 0-)
       But you still didn't personalize the "persuasiveness" to yourself.
       By implication, you speak as if you can decide what is persuasive
       to all readers, not merely to yourself. That is the sort of tactic
       feminists call "mansplaining". Tacitly, it is still a claim to the
       privilege of policing the boundaries of discourse. A claim which I,
       of course, do not concede to you.
       I don't have to rely exclusively on personal experiences to support
       the fact that American history is one of racism and genocide, and
       that history doesn't depend on my personal experiences. The history
       is there and well documented. Even if the US had been a heaven for
       transsexuals rather than the hell it has been, it would still be
       guilty of slavery and genocide. My personal experiences merely
       enable me to call out bullies and bigots when they attempt to
       marginalize and silence me for speaking the truth about this
       culture.
       The Cheney Administration used the American bully culture against
       the American people to fleece them of trillions of dollars. It's a

   Humans can be beastly to each other. We have centuries of history of

   or why their minds seem to have worked on a much less abstract level
   than ours do.
   Thats just heavy breathing hype on the part of science 'journalists'. I
   cant believe MAX PLANCK INST would say such a thing.
   We already know they DIDNT just merge with us, which a DNA comparison
   would be able to show.
   "Mingling' was a very rare event, tho it seems to have happened.
   Still a milestone achievement on more than one level.

       don't thionk we can say they didn't merge with us, in the sense
       that we can't say that not one single interbreeding incident
       occured where a descendant of that union contributed to the gene
       pool of extant humans in some way. It's certainly possible but it's
       hard to demo a negative like that. For example using the same
       criteria we might find a population of ancient Egyptions and be
       able to say they didn't merge with us, even though they definitely
       were part of the whole colorfull modern bloodline.

       they didnt disappear because the 2 species blended together.
       Tiny amounts of presumptive Neanderthal DNA in modern Europeans

 The Homo Sapien Genome & Neander Genome Would Be ([477]0+ / 0-)

   an interesting comparison, seeing as how only about 2% of the human
   genome is "human."

   Our genome is [478]98% microbial.

   What would be interesting would be to see how the microbial symbiont
   match up has or has not changed.

 B612 Donation ([481]0+ / 0-)

   After the Russian meteor, I donated a bunch of money to the b612
   organization because they looked like they were doing an efficient job
   of trying to save Earth from NEOs.  Not much bureaucracy, just activity
   and science.  Glad they got some attention for their hard work.

   Sometimes it really bothers me the type of dumb questions asked at
   these hearings.  We are supposed to be GLAD about that some of these
   folks are "in charge"?

       were some funny and entertaining moments. Like when one politicians

       pick up the Russian metor, and he was trying to be gracious and
       stay out of classified material and still hint that our system
       looks down at the earth for rocket plumes leaving the surface,
       especially in certain regions of the earth, not up and out into
       every direction in space for freezing cold rocks and ice cubes
       humming along in a vacuum.
