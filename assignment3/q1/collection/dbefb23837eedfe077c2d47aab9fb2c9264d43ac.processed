[23]Just 169,000 jobs added in August. June and July revised downward.
Unemployment rate at 7.3%

   The Bureau of Labor Statistics [30]reported Friday that the private
   sector added a seasonally adjusted 152,000 new full-time and part-time
   jobs in August. Governments at all levels added 17,000 workers for an
   overall private-public sector gain of 169,000. The official
   unemployment rate fell to 7.3 percent, mainly because of fewer people
   in the workforce.

   The 162,000 seasonally adjusted jobs gain the BLS reported for July was
   revised to 104,000. The 188,000 for June was revised to 172,000.

   The employment-population ratio fell to 58.6 percent in August. The
   labor force participation rate fell in August to 63.2 percent, the
   lowest level in 35 years. Some of the drop in labor force
   participation, about one-third, according to the Economic Policy
   Institute, is the result of an aging population now beginning to
   retire. But much of the decline in participation is because of
   discouraged workers giving up looking for work out of despair at
   finding anything.

   If the economy maintained the 148,000 average gain in jobs we've seen
   for the past three months, it would take until May of 2028 to return to
   the unemployment levels when the recession began in December 2007.

   You can calculate for yourself how fast the economy would get back to
   the pre-recessionary employment level by using this interactive
   [31]gadget. You can also calculate how many jobs must be created each
   month just to keep up with growth in the working-age population with
   this [32]gadget at the Atlanta Federal Reserve.

   No distinction is made in the BLS's monthly count between full-time and
   part-time jobs. The bureau also does not consider how good the newly
   added jobs are. The BLS numbers effectively capture trends in
   employment, but the headline numbers most media focus on partially
   disguise the real job situation.

   Here are the official (U3) seasonally adjusted unemployment rates in
   August for:

   African Americans--13 percent
   Latinos--9.3 percent
   Asian Americans--5.1 percent (not seasonally adjusted)
   American Indians--Not counted
   Women--6.3 percent
   Unemployment by race. The joblessness of American Indians is not
   counted &nbsp;in the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly report.
   Unemployment by race. The joblessness of American Indians is not
   counted
   in the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly report.
   For more details about today's jobs report and some related charts,
   please continue reading below the fold.

   Internally, the BLS calls the official unemployment rate--the headline
   number--U3. But the bureau also calculates a more complete measure
   called U6 that rarely makes the headlines. This number includes
   Americans who work part-time even though they want full-time jobs. The
   jargon calls them "part time for economic reasons. They constitute the
   so-called underemployed. In July, U6 fell by 0.3 percent to 14.0
   percent. It [33]fell to 13.7 percent in August.

   U6 also covers a portion of "discouraged workers" who want jobs but
   have given up looking within the past year. Those who have given up
   looking for more than a year but still say they want a job are not
   included in the U6 count. Statistically they don't exist. That fact is
   part of what concentration on the headline numbers disguises.

   Simply put, [34]the numbers are calculated in such a way that that it's
   too easy to be considered employed and too hard to be considered
   unemployed. If you worked one hour a week, you are counted as employed.
   If you still want a job but you've given up looking for more than 12
   months, you aren't counted at all. You're viewed as being out of the
   labor force altogether. That skews the headline numbers.

   The number of long-term unemployed, those out of work for 27 weeks or
   more, was 4.3 million, accounting for 37.9 percent of the unemployed.

   Among other news in the July job report:

   o Professional services: +23,000
   o Leisure & hospitality: +21,000
   o Health care: +33,000
   o Retail trade: +44,000
   o Construction:  0
   o Manufacturing: +14,000
   o Average workweek (for production and non-supervisory workers) rose to
   34.5 hours.
   o Average manufacturing hours rose 40.8 hours.
   o Average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls
   rose 5 cents from July's revised figure to $24.05.
   Labor force participation rate
   Here's what the job growth numbers looked like in August for the
   previous 10 years.

   August 2003:    -44,000
   August 2004: +125,000
   August 2005: +192,000
   August 2006: +179,000
   August 2007:    -24,000
   August 2008:  -270,000
   August 2009:  -210,000
   August 2010:  -  37,000
   August 2011: +132,000
   August 2012: +165,000
   August 2013: +169,000

   A report by Automated Data Processing on Wednesday [35]put the
   seasonally adjusted increase of private-sector jobs in August at
   176,000.

     [The BLS jobs report is the product of a pair of surveys, one of
     more than 410,000 business establishments called Current Employment
     Statistics, and one called the Current Population Survey, which
     questions 60,000 householders each month. The establishment survey
     determines how many new jobs were added. It is always calculated on
     a seasonally adjusted basis determined by a frequently tweaked
     formula.  The BLS report only provides a snapshot of what's
     happening at a single point in time.
     It's important to understand that the
     jobs-created-last-month-numbers that it reports are not "real." Not
     because of a conspiracy, but because statisticians apply formulas to
     the raw data, estimate the number of jobs created by the "birth" and
     "death" of businesses, and use other filters to fine-tune the
     numbers. And, always good to remember, in the fine print, they tell
     us that the actual number of newly created jobs reported is actually
     plus or minus 100,000.]

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

     [145]Unemployment
     The number of unemployed youth in July 2013 was 3.8 million,
     compared with 4.0 million a year ago. The youth unemployment rate
     was 16.3 percent in July 2013. Among the major demographic groups,
     unemployment rates were lower than a year earlier in July for young
     women (14.8 percent) and whites (13.9 percent), while jobless rates
     changed little for young men (17.6 percent), blacks (28.2 percent),
     Asians (15.0 percent), and Hispanics (18.1 percent). (See table 2.)

   They just can get their parents out of their damned jobs.   Take a long
   time to pay off student loans without summer and part-time jobs.

       That person read the auto-reply in my e-mail stating that my
       materials had been received and were being reviewed.
       That person 15% of the time has gotten a further contact from a

       fact that YOUR job requirements and MY resume are a 100%,

       back at all, and after a "decent interval" (3 days? 1 week? 10
       days?--the advice varies) has called back and been told, "Oh we
       filled that position three weeks ago." IOW BEFORE you applied--
       because you had an internal candidate but your HR department told
       you for some "labor law" reason you needed to post it.
       That person has done all of the above 3 or 5 or 12 times A DAY, 7
       days a week ("because looking for your job IS your job") for
       months. That person has knuckles bleeding from knocking on the door

 I am hoping to hire a person next month... ([183]0+ / 0-)
       if that happens it will either be the guy who stopped by a month
       ago and said he was losing his job in a month and was planning
       ahead, or the single mother who lives down the street who drives 30
       miles everyday to work at Wendys for minimum wage.  Both those
       people show drive and foresight.
       People need to realize that hiring a new person is a big risk for
       an employer--especially if the job involves much training, which
       mine do.  In those cases, the employer is going to be out many
       dollars and many hours before he/she sees any return on their
       investment in you.  Also, being able to do the job is just one part
       of the equation, how a new emplyee interacts with the current
       empoyees is even more important.  If the new employee causes any
       disruption in the workplace then much more is lost.  So tread
       lightly with an open mind and chin up.
       For the record, there have been no people stopping by with bleeding
       knuckles and impresive resumes...probably becuase our area is not
       as hard hit as others.  I feel for WinRev's "that person", I just
       am not conviced there are many of those around here is all.

 Bad, but not as bad as spin ([192]3+ / 0-)

   This report was obviously not very good (especially the revisions), but
   it wasn't exactly bad either.  The number of part time for economic
   reasons fell substantially (remember, most people working part time
   actually want to work part time), the number of "not in the labor
   force, but want a job" (a decent measure of discouraged workers) fell
   substantially, and but for a somewhat inexplicable large drop in the
   number employed in the motion picture industry (down 22k) this report
   would have been right in line.

   I would rate this as about a 5 (out of ten), but am still optimistic
   going forward with the recent ISM hiring data and jobless claims data
   being extremely positive for September.

   an economy stuck in second gear.  No technical recession, but not
   enough to make people feel like things are getting better fast enough.
    The issue is demand, and IMHO this is in turn caused by the decline in
   the % of GDP going to labor.  You can and should fill some of this gap
   with government spending - but that is not a permanent solution.

   As I have written here for over a decade, there is a systemic crisis
   brought about but globalization and technology with no easy answer.

   The worry is that a strike in Syria would cause oil to spike, which as
   NDD and Bondadd have shown essentially acts as a collar on economic
   growth.  This coupled with a debt ceiling crisis that killed consumer
   confidence the last time might be enough to stall the economy.

       Sadly, that is as much a reflection on how weak job creation has

       Obama's record on job creation looks good when compared to George W

   If the economy grows a bit, but jobs disappear, that looks like a
   recession is still going strong. Even the recovery itself is still part
   of the underperformance of the economy. This is still

 News Still Positive ([334]0+ / 0-)

   This is still relatively good news. With all of the obstruction in
   Washington by Repubs and outright meanspiritedness in red states, it's
   a wonder that the economy is doing as well as it is. Instead of
   lamenting the "stagnant" jobs picture, we should redouble our efforts
   to elect a Dem majority in the House and more Dems with spines in the
   Senate in 2014. If we get majorities in both the House and the Senate,
   we'd get a farm bill, infrastructure spending, transportation bill,
   etc. Just think of the all of the stimulus that would create jobs and
   expand economic output. When Rethugs are in power, they fully
   understand Keynesian economics but when Dems are in power, it becomes
   government overreach. Just for slaps and giggles, go back and compare
   government spending under Carter, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, Bush II, and
   Obama. You'll notice that government spending expands under Repubs but
   is stagnant or shrinks under Dems (you'll also notice that deficits
   grow under Reagan, Bush I&II, and shrink under Carter, Clinton, and
   Obama!).

   One unreported detail (at least I haven't seen it yet) is that
   government hiring is back! I believe this is the first month since the
   census hiring a few years ago, that public sector hiring is positive.
   This is a good sign because it could mean that states and local
   government revenue is up so they can start hiring again. Just remember,
   government layoffs have accounted for a bit over a full half percentage
   of the unemployment rate!

       That's certainly better news than layoffs.

   The Case Against Tapering in September - The Jobs Report September 6,
   2013, 11:26 am

   I've heard that Bernancke is planning to do just that.

     Last month on jobs day, I wrote in this space about an economy stuck
     in second gear.  On this month's jobs day, I'd like to reiterate
     that point but add a question, one aimed at the folks across town at
     the Federal Reserve:

     Do you really want to make a car that's puttering along in second
     gear climb a hill?  Because that's, I fear, what you'd be doing if
     you proceed with your plans to taper this month.

     Let me be clear.  This was not a disastrous jobs report.  The
     top-line payroll number -- 169,000 -- wasn't that far off
     expectations (and, in fact, as I forecast 170,000, it's about where
     I thought it would be).  But there were pretty large negative
     revisions to prior months' data: July's already subpar 162,000 jobs
     was revised way down to only 104,000.  June's revisions subtracted
     another 16,000.
