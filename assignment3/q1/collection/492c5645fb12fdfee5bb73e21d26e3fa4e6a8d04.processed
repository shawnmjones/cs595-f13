Howard Dean's vindication, six years later

   Associated Press

   Going into the 2006 midterms, then-chairman of the Democratic National
   Committee Howard Dean, pushed an ambitious plan that the party
   establishment strongly disliked. It was called the "50-state strategy."

   The party believed limited DNC resources needed to be invested in key
   districts and swing states, but Dean envisioned a bottom-up party
   infrastructure literally everywhere in the country. The idea that the
   party would spend money on a ground game in non-competitive "red"
   states was seen as the height of madness, and the 50-state strategy led
   to some notorious shouting matches between Dean and then-DCCC Chairman
   Rahm Emanuel.

   In the end, Dean executed his plan, and that year, Democrats won back
   the House and Senate. Barack Obama largely emulated the 50-state model
   two years later, en route to the White House.

   And six years later, the right is starting to think Dean's model [3]is
   worth emulating.

     Karl Rove offered some advice to his fellow Republicans about what
     the party needs to do to prevent last Tuesday's election from
     happening again on Sean Hannity's radio show Monday. On the list:
     when it comes to engaging voters, be more like former Democratic
     presidential candidate Howard Dean.

     "I hate to say it, but we need to copy what Howard Dean did," he
     told Hannity. "And that is make our ground game in all 50 states."
     [...]

     Rove told Hannity that the lack of GOP ground game made a big
     difference in other states. "We didn't have a ground game in a lot
     of these states with Senate races and so we lost North Dakota by
     3,300 votes," he said. He added the lack of ground game also cost
     the GOP a chance at winning the Senate seat in Montana. "We need to
     have a better ground game in all 50 states," Rove said.

   Of course, Rove's ability to think strategically has come into doubt
   recently -- his spectacular 2012 failures have raised widespread doubts
   about his basic political competence -- so Republicans may pause before
   acting too quickly on Rove's advice.

   But it's nevertheless striking to see Howard Dean's vision become the
   bipartisan standard six years after a whole lot of folks thought he was
   foolish for even proposing the 50-state strategy.

   "The problem," Rove added, "is a Constitutional one. We didn't realize
   that EVERYBODY was allowed to vote, not just our [DEL: lunatics :DEL]
   friends on the Right."

   At the time, I thought Howard Dean was a hero for taking on Rahm. Rahm
   wanted to continue the strategy that lost in 2000 and 2004. Close
   losses in Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004 proved the strategy did not
   really work. Because of Dean's 50 state strategy, the Democrats won a
   victory that paved the way for Obama in 2008 and the amazing results
   that Obama and Congress achieved from 2008 to 2010.

   One reason that Obama knew that the ground game, social media and
   in-person campaigning were his only avenues to winning is overwhelming
   power of the media monopoly. Fox censors and distorts everything he
   says and does. The anti-Obama messengers, e. g. Limbaugh and Hannity,
   are heard across the radio dial. So to get his message out, he had to
   go directly to the people.

   We need to address voting law reform and outlaw voter suppression
   measures and actions of all kinds, yes, and at the same time, we need
   to break up the right wing monopoly of the media. Somehow, we need to
   restore fairness and balance to the media and make FoxNews take down
   its "Fair and Balanced" slogan.

   When will the right ever learn...IT'S THE ISSUES STUPID. If you sober
   up a drunken horse thief in the morning you still have a horse thief.
   If you spread the republican ideology across all 50 states with tea
   party candidates and extremist republicans...after the election you
   still have a democratic majority winning.

   By being so outrageous the right has made voters paranoid enough to
   learn what they need to do to protect themselves out of a need for
   survival so they took a good look all around them and saw GOP liars
   with failed policies and no workable solutions. We have never been a
   center right nation and on the issues most Americans side with a
   liberal ideology.

   Republicans need to start moving left and quit forcing their beliefs
   down voters throats with their unwillingness to compromise or work with
   others. Solutions are not right or left they are what works and solves
   problems...which self serving republicans refuse to accept.

   Coming from Karl Rove, that means the same political pollusion, but
   drilled down into the very weeds of this nation until our informational
   foundation is constructed on the slime of disinformation and Republican
   spin.

   Perhaps putting forth creditable leadership, developing authentic plans
   to better this nation, and getting rid of Karl Rove would be a far
   better Republican plan? Naaaaaa, too much work.

   As I remember somebody said something like "there aren't red states or

   of us thought the Rahm Emanual grand vision of two regional parties was
   the height of madness. We need to be working to turn red states blue.

   It is not too early for the DNC to reach out to the 94 million eligible
   voters who took the election off. The DNC may have to hit them over
   their heads with the idea that down ballot races are nearly as
   important as the federal races. Women were the most visible target in
   the 2010 races but public education funding versus the giveaway to
   charter schools is also a major loss. Many of these gerrymandered races
   can be overcome with increased turnout. Who would be better than women
   running in these races to protect women's health and children's
   education.

   Democrats need to start working the 2014 midterm right now. That means
   we can't take our current structure apart and have to spread it to the
   states that don't now have a ground game. Done right I can see us
   picking up some of the states Republicans take for granted.

   Agreed! The Democrats gained a lot of Senate seats in 2008, and they
   need to work hard to avoid the GOP flipping the Senate in 2014, and the
   Democrats also need to try to win more House seats. Gerrymandering due
   to legislatures and Governors who won in 2010 will make flipping the
   latter to Blue hard.

   I need to do some more research, but I wonder about the conventional
   wisdom that gerrymandering will continue to make the House hard. It
   seems to me that with gerrymandering, you can either get yourself more
   seats, or you can get yourself safer seats, but you can't do both. That
   makes me suspect that the Republican majority is more fragile than it
   appears. It'll be tough to do in a midterm, but not impossible, and
   possibly an advantage in 2016.

   Absolutely agree with Ron Byers #5. Dems made a huge mistake in not
   amping up the energy level in 2010, and got shellacked - will they
   learn from this in 2014, when vulnerable incumbents will include of the
   swing-district House members who won this year, and the Senators who
   benefited from Obama in 2008 (Hagan of NC, Begich of AK, two Udalls,
   Johnson in SD)?

   The ground game is very important in the state houses. There are
   purplish states out there that the Dems can take at the state level,
   and that will affect redistricting as well as many other issues.

   Yes, there should be a 50-state strategy. That strategy does not mean
   spending equally per state or per capita, but to look hard at every
   state and every race to increase the margin of victory.

   Agreed. The Dems need to step it up on the state level but not just in
   purple states. They need to go after Arizona and Texas in the local and
   2014 elections. Watching Rove pull out whatever little is left of his
   hair would be worth the money. And it would put Republicans on the
   defensive for the next 4 years trying to protect the two states. Dems
   could easily force Republicans to spend a lot of money on two states
   they felt were safe. That means less money for other states races. It
   also paves the way for Dems to recruit the best people when they have a
   majority of votes.

   It is their ground game, too. However, Rove's conception of the "50
   State Strategy" probably only extends as far as spending money in a lot
   of states. To really do it, you need an army of volunteers, and other
   than the Religious Right, Republicans activists have never been asked
   to volunteer. It's not something you can build overnight.

   Gov. Dean is a leader who either should be the new head of the DNC or
   Secretary of Health and Human Services, both of which he is highly
   qualified to administer. He needs to be IN this administration and
   speaking out for the policies the President wants to embed in the
   mainstream of political thought and action. (I always thought the
   beltway media were behind his negative coverage following the Iowa
   win.)

   The Republicans will never be able to come close to replicating what
   President Obama built on in 08 and 12 - it involves people willing to
   get to know each other - and follow each other - and swallow their
   pride and ideology and work toward a common goal. The Republican
   response to their fellow citizens, that we are moochers, that we are
   "maggots", that we elected a foreign born terrorist sympathizer (twice)
   will not be forgotten anytime soon. Republicans have yet to realize
   that they embraced the 47% comment when they lost. They didn't limit
   their attacks to their political opponent - they attacked their fellow
   American voters.

   Americans rejected their ideas, their ideology and their candidates -
   and in return we were told we're ill informed, moocher maggots - once
   again - they show that their conservative bubble in unbreakable. THEY
   don't need new ideas, THEY don't need new ideology, THEY don't need new
   candidates - it's us, the darn American voters - who ruined their
   moment.

   ....And the main reason he was able to do so so successfully is that

   The 50 state strategy made huge inroads into "safe" GOP territory.
   Having paid organizers in every state helped foster volunteer
   infrastructure that we're still using.

   The next step for us it to recognize the diminishing returns in pouring
   money only into races that everyone perceives as winnable-- the kind
   that outside money routinely floods. The DNC and DCCC need to get
   better at recruiting and supporting candidates in places that some
   early money can garner the buzz needed for them to draw donors and
   outside support. The way they work now by waiting for candidates to
   prove themselves viable, they end up in cash-on-cash slugfests that
   drain valuable funds into quickly saturated media markets. While it's
   not a good idea to go to the mat for every "some dude" that pops up,
   focusing on recruiting good people and getting staff and organizers
   even in the boonies has a ripple effect statewide and- through social
   media- nationwide.

   On the other side of the equation, we need to get better at being
   organized in friendly territory. The DCCC and the DNC can't do this,
   but activists need to work to make sure that officials elected from
   solid blue districts don't suck. The way it is now, it's a matter of
   connections and not democracy in urban districts that have their
   nominating fights in committees and boardrooms instead of on the
   ballot.

   Everyone thinks that they will alter history, but it rarely happens.
   Since 1932 (80 years and counting) the Democrats control the White
   House for 8 years and then the Republicans control the White House for
   8 years. Back-and-forth, and this seems to be what the people want. A
   lot of money spent at Ohio TV stations for ads gets wasted in the
   meantime.

   There are only 2 exceptions to the rule. We had to wait until "King"
   FDR died to change the Constitution and limit presidential terms.
   Carter was an extreme failure and so his extra 4 years were absorbed on
   the back end by Republican H.W. Bush, after Reagan finished his 2
   terms.

   - 48 years/Republicans - 32 years. And, no, you don't get to add any of
   President Carter's four years onto St. Ronnie's terms. Eight years were
   quite obviously too many when they occurred and we don't need
   Republican revisionism making it any worse!

   Shall we go into the make-up of the House and Senate during these
   Presidencies? I'm willing.

   By the way, the only reason the 22nd Amendment was passed was out of
   Republican spite and that worked out soooo well for them, didn't it?
   The Amendment went into effect in 1952, the year Eisenhower was elected
   and, had it not been for the limitation, he could have run in 1960.

   Considering how close the election between JFK and Nixon was, had
   Eisenhower been able to run there's no doubt he would have won.

   C'mon, Doug! How convenient to include FDR (before our first "king"
   died and the rules changed). Nice job trying to move the statistics
   your way. Let's try this again starting with 1948.

   1948...Dem, 1952...Rep, 1956...Rep, 1960...Dem, 1964...Dem, 1968...Rep,
   1972...Rep, 1976...Dem, 1980...Rep, 1984...Rep, 1988...Rep, 1992...Dem,
   1996...Dem, 2000...Rep, 2004...Rep, 2008...Dem, 2012...Dem

   Looks to me like Republicans win the rematch, but just barely....9 to
   8. Fact is, Doug, the people almost always give a party 2 terms as
   president, then, abruptly shift, giving the other party 2 terms. Carter
   was an exception to the rule. I'm not surprised that Obama won a 2nd
   term. But watch out in 2016, as the Republicans will almost surely
   regain the White House, simply based on statistics.

   Notice the link. The Democratic objections to a 50 State strategy were
   financial. It was questionable whether the DNC had the resources to
   execute the model - but they managed to make it work.

   What Rove is having to do is find a way to continue moving large sums
   of money through his Super PAC and deflect criticism. This 'new'
   approach means Rove can blame the general Republican strategy for
   electoral losses (avoiding blame himself) and make the case for people
   giving him even more money to support a wider and more intense campaign
   in coming elections.

   This isn't innovation. It's self-interest.
