Rationalizing bigotry is tougher than expected

   We've been keeping an eye on the [3]controversy surrounding Tracy
   Thorne-Begland's judicial nomination in Virginia, and it took an
   interesting turn yesterday.

   To briefly recap, Thorne-Begland, who enjoyed bipartisan backing, is a
   state prosecutor, a father, and a former Top Gun fighter pilot, and his
   nomination enjoyed bipartisan sponsorship, but the Virginia Republicans
   rejected him anyway. Because Thorne-Begland is gay, and supports equal
   rights, the GOP said he's biased and unqualified for the state bench.

   Of course, that rationale didn't make any sense. It'd be the equivalent
   of saying Justice Thurgood Marshall was unqualified for the Supreme
   Court, because he [4]fought for civil rights at the NAACP.

   On CNN yesterday, Virginia Del. Bob Marshall, a far-right Republican,
   [5]offered a new rationale.

   For those who can't watch clips online, the full transcript is
   [8]available, but here's the gist of Marshall's case against
   Thorne-Begland:

     "[H]e had to misstate his background in order to be received into
     the military in the late 1980s. There was a specific question. Are
     you a homosexual? He had to say no.... Dr. Martin Luther King and
     Rosa Parks never took an oath of office that they broke. Sodomy is
     not a civil right. It's not the same as a civil rights movement."

   Let's take these claims one at a time.
     __________________________________________________________________

   First, it's worth noting that the Supreme Court ruled against
   anti-sodomy laws in Texas v. Lawrence, so in a practical sense,
   American adults do have a civil right to engage in consensual sexual
   activity.

   Second, and more important, is the notion that Thorne-Begland can't
   serve on a misdemeanor court because of how he enlisted in the
   military. In this case, Thorne-Begland hid his sexual orientation in
   order to join the Navy, serve his country, put his life on the line in
   a very dangerous position, and become a respected fighter pilot.

   Instead of thanking him for his service, Republicans are now holding
   his service against him -- effectively attacking Thorne-Begland for
   enlisting and promising to protect the rest of us.

   Rationalizing bigotry is apparently harder than Virginia Republicans
   thought it'd be.

   The face of the Republican Party is barbarity, hatred, and heartless
   vindictiveness. Are they really Americans, or do they honestly consider
   themselves members of some quasi-independent cult that has no
   responsibility to this country? This is modern day Jim Crow, an
   ideology based on Nazi-style repression of all activity of honest
   American citizens. All just for being gay? Are "small government"
   Republicans listening to themselves? they are utterly incoherent in
   their hypocritical positions. This level of hate is serious and
   dangerous for America. [18]w [19]http://www.sunstateactivist.org

   How funny is it that the same people that gets all riled up if you
   allow a flag to touch the ground are the biggest threat to our freedoms
   and democracy. The GOP considers Roseanne Barr unpatriotic because she
   lacks singing skills, but applauds Joe Wilson for yelling "liar" during
   SOTU.

   I'm not a Ron Paul supporter, but the one thing I like about him is the
   believe in just let people live their lives. People should be able to
   marry anyone they want without any interference from the goverment. The
   only limitation should be consenting adult.

   I, too, am bothered by a neglected flag. When I see a frayed flag being
   flown by a company, I will complain to the company. Usually, it is
   simple oversight and most times, those flags were replaced within days.

   As for Ron Paul, his Libertarian views are select. You simply cannot be
   a Libertarian and be against birth control and abortion. Otherwise, if
   you really listen to Ron Paul, he's insane (he's economically
   challenged to say the very least). He lives in a fantasy world where
   letting anyone or any company do anything makes life for all wonderful.
   Pollution? Non existent because no one will buy from a company that
   pollutes. (Really? Unicorn farts smell delicious!) Who needs civil
   rights, if a restaurant doesn't want black people there, people just
   won't support that restaurant (Did I mention eating unicorn @!$%# makes
   you live forevah!?)

   Libertarian ideals are just that, ideal. They do not work in a world
   driven by corporate greed.

   Sorry, didn't mean to pick on you...not at all, especially since you're
   not buying into Paul's arguments. I, too, agree that people should be
   able to live their lives as they wish, as long as no one else is hurt
   by it (a Libertarian value). But corporations are not people and they
   do do harm.

   Ok, rant off now.

   Sometimes, when I'm tempted to quit my job, I fantasize about getting a

   of American flags and setting out on the road with a decent inventory.
   I'd stop where ever I saw a frayed or otherwise worn flag and offer to
   sell a replacement.

Speaking of flags touching the ground, I was in DC on 9/12/10 and there was a
not-so-big tea party rally on the mall that day. Late in the afternoon my
husband spotted some TP items that were left near the entry of one of the
Smithsonian museums: namely a couple of signs "Don't believe the Liberal
Media" and a flag, the lower half of which was touching the pavement. Wow,
what patriots!

   There are always going to be bigoted people on either side of the isle
   and to the extent that a person does not recognize bigotry as existent
   on either side that could be stated as hypocritical. However you are
   taking an absolutist position here: you are automatically and
   incorrectly and incoherently assuming that because @TheActivist did not
   state both Republicans and Democrats that this therefore means that
   TheActivist was stating only Republicans are bigoted. That's like
   saying that because I say "I like the color blue" that I am necessarily
   saying I hate every other color. You are attempting to point out
   hypocrisy here, but in reality you are only succeeding in committing a
   logical fallacy. YET AGAIN PLEASE CONSERVATIVES/REPUBLICANS FOR THE
   LOVE OF GOD: logical fallacies do NOT point out hypocrisy.

   One more thing: it is not intolerance for someone to express
   disagreement to your world views. Tolerance does not mean that you get
   to say whatever you want and no one else gets to have a contrary
   opinion or voice to you. Again this is an absolutist and authoritarian
   interpretation of tolerance and, ironically enough, is w/in it's own
   nature very intolerant. You are essentially using what I like to call
   the Tracy Jordan defense. *In Tracy's voice*: "You all know I'm
   irresponsible and stupid therefore whenever I say something hate filled
   and bigoted it's YOUR responsibility to clean up after me!" That's not
   the way tolerance works. Tolerance means that you are not going to use
   the law to abuse someone or force someone into submission simply
   because you arbitrarily decide it's the right thing. Acceptance means
   you agree w/ a person 100%. Tolerance =/= Acceptance.

   It is funny to see a group of Republican men adopt a belief that
   homosexuals are incapable of holding a public office. The man was
   capable of piloting a fighter plane but, not capable of this vocation
   in their eyes. The people in the state of Virginia should remove the
   pebble from their eyes so they might see that the men dictating these
   rules should be the ones removed. How convenient it is for them to
   interpret the Bible into their own language of hate. The Bible is a
   History book not a reference in which to adopt Hate rulings of their
   own making. The actors have merely switched places in their minds they
   are now playing the role of The Romans.

   Seems to me that these "small government" conservative types always
   want to be intrusive when it comes to "other people's sex lives". I
   mean do they even understand the meaning of hypocrisy or
   double-standards? For that matter most of these types tend toward being
   evangelical (born again) - so maybe it's being "born again" that has
   allowed them to: be hate-filled towards everyone else, not understand
   the meaning of morality, allows them to have no empathy for "the least
   of these", live in glass houses yet throw boulders at "others", allows
   them to participate in a mass hysterical psychosis - whatever it is ,
   I'd just like to know how do WE undo their paranoia?

   It doesn't appear to me that the GOP is ever going to figure out that
   being gay isn't nearly as much about sex as they think it is. Aside
   from their sexual preferences, gay men and women lead lives that are
   much the same as the rest of us. They go to school, go to work, shop,
   participate in sports, buy groceries, cook meals, clean house, mow the
   lawn, watch TV, and pay bills. Just like the rest of us. They're not
   sex offenders or any less moral than we are. And they don't judge us as
   heterosexuals for our natural inclinations. They just want to live
   thier lives pretty much like anyone else, and shouldn't be cast out for
   doing so. But like I said, the GOP don't get that. They just want to
   judge and look down on others for being different.

   I think it is interesting that progressive commenters keep using the
   argument that prior advocacy as a disqualifying factor would have mead
   Thurgood Marshall ineligible for the Supreme Court - as if that ipso
   facto proves the Del Marshalls of Virginia wrong in a way that will be
   obvious even to them.

   I doubt it. I strongly suspect that any argument that delegitimizes
   Thurgood Marshall and his opinions is one the right would favor and
   adopt. Rather than hearing that argument and saying "gee, we must be
   wrong about Thorne-Begland" they will instead hear it and say "damn
   right - we never should have let that negro on the court either!"

   I see so a patriotic American who appearently put his country above his

   Justice and declare corporations are people?

   Well now it should be noted that no NAZI or Klansman can enlist in the
   service either.

   Once the government had its hands on Bush's books, the whole story of
   the intricate web of Nazi front corporations began to unravel. A few
   days later two of Union Banking's subsidiaries -- the Holland American
   Trading Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation --
   also were seized. Then the government went after the Harriman Fifteen
   Holding Company, which Bush shared with his father-in-law, Bert Walker,
   the Hamburg-Amerika Line, and the Silesian-American Corporation. The
   U.S. government found that huge sections of Prescott Bush's empire had
   been operated on behalf of Nazi Germany and had greatly assisted the
   German war effort."

   I joined the military in the early 80's. 1982 to be exact. There was no
   question on any form that asked about who I was boning or what my
   boning preference was. I like how all the people who never spent a
   minute in the military pretend to know the military. DADT wasn't
   created until Clinton was in office (late 90's) and it was then that
   sexual preference became a military concern.

   ...when DADT was put into place they were no longer allowed to ask
   people on paper or in person whether or not you were a homosexual. They
   did this in Vietnam and prior to Vietnam, but stopped about a decade
   later. I do think the military stopped asking in anticipation of DADT
   or gay service being accepted and this was shortly after women were
   allowed in the US military. So more than likely it depends on when
   either of you joined the service. FTR The Simpsons did a spoof of this,
   but I cannot seem to find a video to link to ya. Basically Homer starts
   to fill out a form and crossed off on it is the question "are you a
   homosexual" and Homer attempts to answer it outloud, but fearing jail
   time his recruiter covers his ears and runs out of the building
   screaming "la la la!"

   Just to clarify, if Tracy Thorne-Begland was a Navy pilot, then he was
   an officer. If he was an officer, then he was not "enlisted," he was
   commissioned. I know it seems petty, but for those who know the
   difference, it makes the reporting sound weak.

   Also, something that hasn't been brought up (that I have seen) is that
   Tracy Thorne-Begland was serving as an openly gay officer. [132]He was
   discharged under DADT. Can the TRMS confirm that this is the case? I
   think that this takes all the wind out of Mr. Marshall's sails.

   This article only tells part of the story. 8 Republicans voted for this
   appointment. The real reason that Tracy Thorne-Begland did not get
   appointed is that 36 of the approximately 100 members of the Virginia
   Assembly either abstained or failed to vote one way or another. Since
   it takes 51 members to appoint, it is no surprise that he did not get
   appointed. Most of the Assemblymen that failed to vote were Democrats.
