[22]GOP congressman: If immigration reform doesn't stop immigration, it will
kill the Republican Party

   GOP gunslinger
   Republican congressman Raul Labrador on NBC's Meet the Press,
   [29]explaining explaining why he opposes the Senate's immigration
   reform bill:

     I actually think if we don't do it right politically it's going to
     be the death of the Republican Party. If we do it right, I think
     it's going to be good for us. But if we don't do it right, what's
     going to happen is that we're going to lose our base because we're
     still going to have a large number of illegal immigrants coming into
     the United States. And the Hispanic community is not going to listen
     to us because they're going to always listen to, at this point, to
     the people that are offering more, that are offering a faster
     pathway to citizenship, all those things. So, I think we lose on
     both grounds if we don't do it right.

   In other words, according to Labrador (who is, ironically, Hispanic):
   Republicans should oppose immigration reform unless it stops Hispanic
   immigration into the United States because Republicans don't have much
   to offer to Hispanics. Even if you set aside the crass nature of
   Labrador's political calculation on how his party should handle a
   question of basic human dignity, isn't it amazing that he seems
   oblivious to the fact that Republicans could do something about the
   fact that they are so unpopular with Hispanics? Instead, he--and his
   fellow conservatives--seem eager to make their problem even worse.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [43]Civil
   Rights, [44]Community, [45]Congress, [46]Culture, [47]Economy,
   [48]Education, [49]Elections, [50]Energy, [51]Environment, [52]Health
   Care, [53]International, [54]Labor, [55]Law, [56]Media, [57]Meta,
   [58]National Security, [59]Science, [60]Transportation, or [61]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([62]California, [63]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       When President Johnson signed the Civil Rights bill he accurately
       predicted that it would give the South to the Republicans.
       Things have changed. Republicans are backed into a no-win
       situation, and the result will eventually turn Texas, then the
       whole South, Democratic. Only states that can retain their white
       ethnic purity will escape.

       Give me Texas leaning blue and I'll let them have Florida in
       exchange. The map gets incredibly ugly for the GOP. Look at this as
       a starting point: [97]http://www.270towin.com/...
       Hell, give them every close state (Ohio, Virginia, Florida, North
       Carolina) and give us Texas, we still win. They are looking at
       flipping states Obama carried by 5 points just to get in the game.

 All they really need is to restrict voting... ([102]4+ / 0-)

       Gerrymandering, Illegal voting restrictions, what have you -- all
       the GOP really needs to hold on is to stem the tide of immigration
       slightly, continue disenfranchising minorities through things like
       the Drug War and illegal anti-minority voting laws, and they'll
       hold on for decades to come.
       Which is why they gutted the Voting Rights Act.  They had no
       choice, with the VRA intact they were doomed in places like Texas.
        Now Texas can just make it hard enough to vote if you're not white
       and republican and it doesn't matter how "blue" Texas gets, they'll
       retain it.

       Today the ACLU, Wendy Davis and other organizations filed suit on
       Section 3 of the the VRA, alleging discrimination against minority
       voters.  Section 4 simply discarded the existing maps of
       "pre-clearance" states, but section 3 allows the courts to start
       all over again and create a new list.  I'm thinking that a lot of
       organizations are going to be doing the same thing in other states
       formerly required to clear voting changes.

       endlessly dividing themselves with the 'No True Scotsman' fallacy.
       They expect 'legal' Hispanics to turn on 'illegal' Hispanics, to
       say 'we are not like them' -- or to choose some social issue over
       their own brothers and sisters as the GOP has done over the last 30
       years. This is why you hear GOP operatives saying something like
       'but they're Catholic...why don't they love us for our
       anti-abortion/anti-gay marriage stance?'
       The GOP is mighty confused when Hispanics do not divide themselves
       into ever smaller groups which the GOP could then gather in...and
       can't help saying further damaging things in an attempt to get them
       to do so.

   No jobs..and from a very recent  report on this by PEW:  "The survey

       The border needs much less "enforcement" than advertised because
       the potential "payoff" for a border crossing is no longer worth the
       risk.
       That won't be admitted until the flow of Elite College grads is
       undeniably, very visibly North to South of the Border.

   So the Republican Party, that claims to champion "meritocracy" --
   winning based on the merits of an argument, or product, in the
   marketplace -- can't handle a meritocracy if it means their party will
   lose?

   Oh delicious irony.

   How you continue to expose the right wing fraud for what it is -- white
   privilege dressed up in pseudo-intellectualism.

   But when the chips are on the table, Republicans are happy to break the
   rules, bend the rules, lie, cheat, and steal, to maintain the power
   that their presumed "merit" has earned.

   What a joke.

   The big problem of illegal immigrants for ordinary Americans is not the
   presence of people with a different culture, it's people who cannot
   legally work and fear report abuses.

   People who are in the country legally -- including legal immigrants --
   must then compete for jobs on a tilted playing field.

   An immigration bill that does not allow enforcement officials to stomp
   on employers who hire illegal immigrants and does not protect the
   rights of American workers will be bad news for everybody.

       You are parrotting the myth that illegal immigrants take jobs that
       Americans don't want.
       That, however, is only part of the picture.
       They also take jobs that Americans and legal immigrants afforded
       the protection of labor laws do want.  They take them without
       recourse to legal protections.
       One of the big stories out of Katrina was ripping off illegal
       immigrant construction workers who flocked to the New Orleans for
       big paydays.
       Immigration is a lovely thing. People come here who actually want
       to be here.  Many of them work very hard and contribute to the
       future of this country. We should not relegate them to an
       undercalss. We should not abuse them and take advantage of them.
       Likewise, we should not make Americans subject to the same sort of
       abuse for the simple want of a job.

   if they were legal, immigrants might still be likely to take those jobs
   because they know how to do them well and what they can make here is
   more than what they can make at home for doing the same job.

   Even illegal immigrants who are educated don't want those jobs, no more
   than most Americans do (though most Americans seem to totally overrate
   their skill levels).

   It's the difference between seeing a job as an opportunity or as a
   punishment.

   To most immigrants, legal or illegal, a job is seen as an opportunity -
   a way to get ahead, get their children a better future, make a new
   life. Even if the work is backbreaking.

   To most Americans, a hard physical job that doesn't pay a lot is seen
   as a punishment, something you get forced to do, something that's a
   step backwards, that will get you nowhere.

       The problem with our current immigration is that it fails to

       I believe that the US has as much right to protect its border as
       Mexico does -- and don't kid yourself, Mexico is not friendlh to
       illegal entrants.
       I also believe that we should welcome immigrants.  Think of all
       those immigrants -- including those who entered illegally -- who
       have been here raising families, doing jobs, starting businesses,
       and making the US a better place.  We want those people. We'd be

       Even if they're only here temporarily. If they don't want to stay,
       we shouldn't make it so hard for them to come and go that we in

       The GOP has pretty much done that. It's part of the reason why
       there are so many younger Hispanic voters, and so many who will be
       eligible to vote soon.
       You make people stay somewhere, they create families. It's what
       people are pretty much hard-wired to do. Which means they have kids
       HERE, and those kids are CITIZENS.
       If you don't want an increase in the number of Hispanic CITIZENS,

 "Republicans and Democrats agree 'Labor' is an ([503]0+ / 0-)

       I.e., that both parties only see labor as an expense and seek to
       devalue it further.
       That is simply not true.  Ds do not simply see it as an expense.
       If they did so, the Democratic party would not be committed to
       raising the cost of labor through the measures I gave examples of,
       as well as other (including raising safety and enviromental
       standards).  Some D pols do not agree with the party, of course,
       but they are the exception not the rule.

   Legal citizens of Hispanic ancestry are still going to be Democratic
   leaning on every other issue, more or less. So even setting aside CIR,
   giving millions of Hispanics the right to vote is a setback for the
   GOP.

   Denying them citizenship, though, gives the millions of legal citizens
   of Hispanic ancestry that already exist still more motivation to vote
   Democratic - and, more to the point, to turn out and vote.

   Remember: Hispanic voter turnout comes up to AA and white levels, and
   Texas is in play in 2016, and probably leans blue by 2020.

   The worst thing the GOP could do is provide a path to citizenship in
   such a ham-fisted, grudging manner that it both giving millions of new
   Democratic voters citizenship while still infuriating the existing
   citizens.

   Here's betting that they are capable of that level of fail.

   Republicans are afraid that all those brown skinned people will vote

   to pass disenfranchise US citizens only, because illegals aren't trying
   to and can't vote.  Even with a path to citizenship, illegals (I hate
   that term) will not be eligible to vote for 12-15 years, at minimum.

   Long before then, Texas and half the southern states, will be turning
   blue.  Republicans worry so much about what is going to happen to them
   down the road that they are willing to alienate the Hispanic voters
   right now, which will guarantee that they lose down the road as well.

   Whenever you see this phrase

   It's time to be on a strawman alert. Unfortunately that's  the case
   here. Rep Labrador did not say this:

     Republicans should oppose immigration reform unless it stops
     Hispanic immigration into the United States because Republicans
     don't have much to offer to Hispanics.

   What he said was ... well there's quite a bit of weasel-room in what he
   said referred to illegal immigration in the future. He did not say
   anything about stopping all Hispanic immigration in the future.

   I take his meaning to be along these lines:

   The Hispanic community will always be concerned about immigration law
   as it pertains to citizenship, because there will always be some
   illegal immigration. The Hispanic community will therefor always tend
   to support the party seen to be the strongest supporter of a path to
   citizenship.

   Which is hardly the same sort of crass, mean-spirited statement as the
   strawman erected. In fact, it seems like pretty basic politics.
   Straight talk from a member of the Hispanic community.

     ...we're going to lose our base because we're still going to have a

   Exactly where does the Representative think his "base" is going to go?
    To the Democrats, who want to make a pathway to citizenship for
   undocumented immigrants less onerous?  Unlikely.  Does he fear his base
   will start a third party over this one issue?  Less likely.

   What's most likely to happen if the Republicans refuse to come to terms
   on an immigration bill is that he's going to lose his "base" in the
   business community who overwhelmingly favor the immigration bill just
   passed by the Senate and don't particularly oppose having "a large
   number of illegal immigrants coming into the United States" since they
   can be hired at much lower wages.

 Not every job is for every person ([649]0+ / 0-)
       Young people w/o families might be more apt to take that sort of
       job. If they are returning to their home communities they bring
       that money back to that community. It gets spent there, creating
       more jobs in the community for those that don't want to travel.
       Today, often times the person and the money is stuck north of the
       border.
       I worked for a company that moved its factories to Juarez. After
       one year of operation, not a single worker on staff had a full
       year's experience. Every single person who was employed on Day 1 of
       operations had quit by day 365. This is a statement of fact not an
       exaggeration. These people were simply carrying out their own
       plans. They chose to work for several months, save up money, then
       return to their families.
       Believe me, factory management wanted workers to stay. Desperately.
       The need for constant training cost money and worse it prevented
       that factory from making anything but the simplest item (item -
       singular) in our product line of some 4,000 items.
       This to me seems to indicate there are millions of workers who
       would be comfortable with the ability to travel to the US and back
       with the understanding both the job and the residency would be
       temporary - but legal and safe.
       Anyway, as you say we agree. I'm just hoping to put your mind at

   I suppose finishing off the Republican party is almost as important to
   the country as immigration reform.

 Human Beings ([657]0+ / 0-)

   These people never seem to speak about these immigrants as if they are
   human beings.  Most probably didn't want to leave their homes.  They
   miss their families.  Their children, born here, are not supposed to be
   real citizens in some form since their status as citizens and voters is
   a threat to the country.

   Evidently they can't even grasp shy the Latino community detests them
   in such huge numbers.

   The Republican Party can't really change.  It has spent 30 years
   building it's current base, which is energized by fear and racism.  The
   politicians know they have to change to serve the corporate economic
   agenda, but the base won't have any of it in most of their carefully
   segregated districts.

   If all that new fence, hardware, computer systems and a militaries
   border aren't enough, what would be.

   Probably a real, nationally coordinated identity and registration
   system standard across all 50 states, like every other civilized nation
   has, but that would violate states rights and be big brother. It would
   also give us, after a few years a single, reliable national database of
   who is a citizen and whoever else is in the country legally.  The
   Republican base is opposed to a system so we really don't have a list
   of who is supposed to be here, who was born here and who is a citizen.
    We have a system founded on shaky state and local records.

 He is kinda right. The GOP has a conundrum that ([660]0+ / 0-)

   cannot be solved - try to attract the Hispanic or please the base, but
   never both and it could be neither.  Pass the popcorn!

 "Ironically Hispanic" ([663]0+ / 0-)

   Isn't that the title of Raul Labrador's latest album?

   by [664]timkens on [665]Mon Jul 08, 2013 at 09:40:54 AM PDT



 I love the idea of a wood stake or silver bullet ([666]0+ / 0-)

   to kill this incarnation of the Republican party.  Unfortunately, in
   todays gerrymandered environment it seems a Republican in a Red
   district could rape their mother, kill their brother then maim their
   wife all live on a pay-per-view and still get reelected if they promise
   to stop the Gay and Brown and protect the blastocyte.

   The ground for taking ignorance to be restrictive of freedom is that it
   causes people to make choices which they would not have made if they
   had seen what the realization of their choices involved. A.J. Ayer,
   Sir. "The Concept of Freedom "

 I think Labrador is exactly right ([669]0+ / 0-)

   They aren't going to win over Hispanics and they will damage base
   loyalty.  But there is no way for them to "do it right."  They're
   screwed.

 I'm confused ([672]0+ / 0-)

   Do you equate "basic human dignity" with a "right" to illegal
   immigration to the U.S.?

 The most effective villain ([675]0+ / 0-)

   Comes from the class of people of his victims.

   For fiction, look at the recent movie Django Unchained, where Samuel
   Jackson is playing one of the primary villains helping the slave owner.

   For history, guards at Nazi camps who were Jewish.

   For present day, Justices like Uncle Thomas...

   This guy being Hispanic and Republican is not 'shouldn't he know
   better' but 'coup for the GOP to get a race-traiter'.

   People who attack their own can always do a LOT more damage than
   outsiders who attack.

   (Yeah... but there's no other way to say it than that...)

 Raul Labrador - Work on defeating in 2014 ([678]0+ / 0-)

   Or 2016.  Either way, this nation cannot afford more braindead GOP
   Congressmen/Congressowmen.
