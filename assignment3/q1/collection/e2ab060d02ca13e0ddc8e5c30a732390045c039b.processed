   The administration of Gov. Rick Snyder has drafted [156]a new emergency
   manager law they hope will replace Public Act 4 of 2011, which was
   rejected by voters on Nov. 6.

   The bill will be discussed Thursday morning in the House Local
   Intergovernmental and Regional Affairs committee and could be taken up
   by the full House as soon as Thursday afternoon.

   Called the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, the bill is
   designed to address shortcomings in PA 4 by giving local officials in
   financially troubled cities and school district more input in
   decision-making.

   In a statement released Wednesday by state Treasurer Andy Dillons
   office, PA 72 does not provide all of the tools that are necessary to
   address financial emergencies in Michigan municipalities and school
   districts. Governor Snyder feels strongly that he has a responsibility
   to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our residents and
   children.

   Provisions include:

   o Providing for greater input by local officials before a financial
   emergency is declared by the governor. Financial review teams would be
   required to hold at least one public meeting before making a decision.

   o Giving local officials a choice among four options if a financial
   emergency is declared: a consent agreement; mediation; an emergency
   manager; or Chapter 9 bankruptcy.

   o Giving local officials more power to approve certain actions by an
   emergency manager or come up with alternative solutions that provide
   equal cost savings.

   o Paying the salaries of emergency managers, and costs associated with
   a financial review, eliminating a current sore point for cities and
   school districts, which now have to pick up those costs.

   o Providing for the removal of an emergency manager if two-thirds of
   the local unit of government votes in favor of removal.
