   Ogg:  Uck!  What are you doing?!

   Uck:  Bashing head keeps Uck warm, makes me see lights!

   Ogg:  But there are other ways to keep warm, and make lights too!

   Uck:  This work well, though.  Me do this for long long time.  No need
   to change, Ogg.

   Ogg:  But the pain will just get worse!

   Uck:  That is just theory, not fact before my eyes.  Headaches are
   naturally-occurring.  There have been headaches before.

   Ogg:  But scientists agree overwhelmingly you're causing your head to
   ache, and the pain will increase!

   Uck:  Uck fine now.  Me warm.  See lights.

   Ogg:  But, but this is terrible for civilization, innovation, the
   economy!

   Uck:  I will stop if Chunuk and Indoog stop too.

   Ogg:  Uck, please!  Put down the club!

   Uck:  But club-makers mean jobs!

   Ogg:  You- you can't keep this up forever!

   Uck:  Then me get bigger club from North-land, and get more bang for
   club!

   Ogg:  That's even worse!  The pain will happen faster!

   Uck:  Everybody's doing it.

   Ogg:  I know, that's why it's worse!

   Uck:  You forgot one thing, Ogg.

   Ogg:  What?

   [beat]

   Uck:  Emissions from club.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [58]Tagging tips - [59]Search For Tags - [60]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [61]Civil
   Rights, [62]Community, [63]Congress, [64]Culture, [65]Economy,
   [66]Education, [67]Elections, [68]Energy, [69]Environment, [70]Health
   Care, [71]International, [72]Labor, [73]Law, [74]Media, [75]Meta,
   [76]National Security, [77]Science, [78]Transportation, or [79]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([80]California, [81]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   Are you sure you want to remove this diary from your hotlist?
   Are you sure you want to remove your recommendation? You can only
   recommend a diary once, so you will not be able to re-recommend it
   afterwards.
   Rescue this diary, and add a note:

   Are you sure you want to remove this diary from Rescue?

 Insensitive to musical headbangers. Shame on you! ([118]4+ / 0-)

       In all seriousness though (and on a completely unrelated note) this
       reminds me of several years ago when Judas Priest singer Rob
       Halford met Queen Elizabeth II.
       Queen Elizabeth II to Halford:

     "Why is Heavy Metal so loud?"
       Rob Halford, with characteristic politeness:

     "You have to have it loud to bang your head, Your Majesty."
       Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!
