Wisconsin sets recalls for Walker, GOP state senators; Republican majority at
stake

   UPDATE: A federal judge in Wisconsin today [3]struck part of the
   state's union-stripping bill (pdf of the [4]ruling).

   EARLIER: As expected, the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board
   ordered recall elections for Governor Scott Walker, Lieutenant Governor
   Rebecca Kleefisch and three Republican state Senators. The board also
   ordered a [5]recall election for a fourth Republican state senator, Pam
   Galloway, but [6]she resigned earlier this month. Depending on
   potential primaries, the elections will happen May 8 and June 5.

   Organizers had turned in an [7]overwhelming number of signatures for
   recalling Walker and Kleefisch especially, and those signatures proved
   to be valid at a rate of more than 95 percent. From the [8]Wisconsin
   State Journal:

     The board's staff had said in a memo Thursday that there were five
     fake names on Walker recall petitions, but it turned out one of
     those they suggested striking -- Fungky Van Den Elzen -- was a real
     person. That means they found just four fake names out of the
     931,053 submitted on the Walker petitions: Adolf Hitler, Mick E.
     Mous, Donald L. Duck, and I Love Scott Walker Thanks.

   That last name, I Love Scott Walker Thanks, sounds more like a protest
   of the recall than an attempt to fake a name for the sake of having him
   kicked out of office.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It's worth noting that Wisconsin Republicans have lost what used to be
   a solid majority in the state Senate. As of this month, they're down to
   a 16-16 tie, with an empty seat and one Republican who sides with
   Democrat on union issues. If they tried to pass Walker's
   union-stripping bill today, they would lose. And if they fail to defend
   the seats they hold that are under recall, they face the loss of their
   majority entirely.

   An outrageous example of Voter Fraud!

   Throw out all the petitions, and make the signers push a peanut with
   their nose to the closest photo ID center. . .

   You have to wonder if there is any correlation between Obama's numbers
   in Wisconsin these days and the recall elections.

   Have Wisconsin's turn to the right finally subsided?

   Once again, the far right fringe is slapped upside the head because
   there were no examples of "fraud" among the nearly 1-million
   signatures. After all, who is going to show up at an election place
   claiming to be Adolph Hitler or Mick E. Mous unless that actually was
   their name? Now, if the rcall movement can get 80% of the people who
   signed petitions to vote when the time comes, we might actually see
   what democracy looks like.

   That's the trick. I hope Wisconsin Dems got e-mail addresses at the
   time they had people signing petitions. They need to use those to
   reinforce the bases for the recall and to remind people to vote.

   The recall petitions should be the recall organizers' best tool. They
   already have names and contact information for almost a million
   supporters. It shouldn't be hard to make follow up phone calls to these
   people, and to get those signers to remind their friends and fellow
   workers to vote.

   We did collect e-mail addresses, but promised to use them only as a
   means of contacting them for verification should their signature be
   challenged. However, as we did in the first round of recalls, we will
   use the PHYSICAL ADDRESSES collected to send targeted mailings and for
   volunteer door-to-door efforts to get out the vote. I imagine efforts
   are already underway to get signers registered to vote if they are not
   registered already.

   The recall drive was grassroots and volunteer driven, and the push for
   the election will be as well. I only wish there were more time after
   the primary, before the general, to really rally behind our candidate.

   I don't understand why Wisconsin Republicans didn't make it a felony to
   turn in improperly filled-out recall petitions. Oh well, live and
   learn!

   The court case is interesting because Wisconsin cannot discriminate
   between classes of union employees regarding the deduction of dues.
   What the Republicans wanted to do was to cut the funding to the public
   employee unions through deductions but not safety employees as defined
   by the statute. That part of the law was struck and the state must
   allow the deduction of dues for all unions. The alternative is that the
   state will have to bar all union dues deductions for all unions.

   Throughout the country, massive voter disenfranchisement campaigns are
   under way. Republican governors who have absolutely NO evidence of any
   voter fraud have said, "It is our duty to anticipate this problem, and
   deal with it before it happens." But of course it is their real purpose
   to disenfranchise cohorts that tend to vote Democratic--the old, the
   young, the ill and disabled, minorities, workers.

   The "voter fraud" drive in Wisconsin at the start relied on ten (yes
   TEN) incorrect votes. Most of those ten were not aware that they were
   ineligible. When Democrats collected nearly a million petition
   signatures (not counting the ones torn out of their hands and thrown
   away by Walker people), as this article points out, there were four
   specious signatures, none of which were certainly placed there by Dems.

   As an aside--Republican petitions in the previous Senatorial recall
   were so riddled with false signatures to get their people on the ballot
   that checking them contributed to the postponement of the election. We
   don't think they came from the above groups--no kidding.

   As for fraudulent voting, that's not an issue in the Republican party
   in Wisconsin. They just send Koch lawyers out to Waukesha the next
   morning, and when they leave, the election is repaired and Prosser et
   al. are elected.
