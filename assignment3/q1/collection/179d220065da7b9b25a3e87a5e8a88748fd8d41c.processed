What we know now about True the Vote

   I got something in the mail yesterday, a certified letter from True the
   Vote in Houston.

   We've been [3]covering the Tea Party-organized group, which trains
   volunteers to challenge voters' registrations and then voters
   themselves at the polls. [4]True the Vote aims to have [5]a million
   poll watchers ready for November, so every precinct in America gets at
   least one. Those watchers are supposed to give voters a feeling like
   "[6]driving and seeing the police following you."

   We knew that True the Vote raised $[7]64,687 (pdf) in 2010, the first
   year the group sent watchers into the polls, and we knew that True the
   Vote reported its revenue as coming from contributions, gifts and
   grants. True the Vote's founder says they get money by passing around
   an [8]old felt cowboy hat at meetings.

   Now that we've got True the Vote's 2011 tax returns, we can tell you
   the old felt hat has gotten a good bit heavier. The group took in twice
   as much money that year -- $136,957 -- as the one before. More than
   half of that came from three contributions: $50,000, $19,000 and
   $5,000. We know the amounts because the IRS requires nonprofits to
   itemize large donations. We don't know who made the donations, because
   the IRS doesn't require nonprofits like True the Vote to reveal that,
   and True the Vote redacted the names in the copy they sent us.

   True the Vote's right to shield the names of its donors is in some
   dispute. In March, a [9]Texas judge ruled that True the Vote is
   operating as an unregistered political action committee supporting
   Republicans, and not as a nonpolitical charity. True the Vote has
   appealed, and for now, this is what the public can see about their
   big-money donors (red circles added):

   A couple more bits about True the Vote:
     __________________________________________________________________

   True the Vote was founded by King Street Patriots, a Houston Tea Party
   chapter. In August 2011, according to the tax papers, the founders
   moved to change the official name from KSP/True the Vote to just True
   the Vote. The idea, they wrote, is that King Street Patriots has a
   different mission. In September 2011, True the Vote reached a "facility
   use agreement" in which it pays the King Street for "occupancy costs."
   By December 2011, True the Vote owed King Street Patriots $22,038 for
   "occupancy related costs" and "certain costs paid by King Street
   Patriots for programmatic activities of True the Vote."

   Anybody want to bet that the names within those circles aren't those of
   the Koch Brothers, Harold Simmons, Bob Perry, Jim Davis, Edward Conard,
   or other multi-million dollar donors to the Romney campaign?
