[23]NC jobless losing federal compensation Sunday: 'They are really putting
the gun to your head now.'

   At 8.8 percent, the official unemployment rate in North Carolina is the
   [30]fifth highest in the nation, with only Nevada, Illinois,
   Mississippi and Rhode Island worse off. As elsewhere across America,
   that figure doesn't fully measure the misery of the state's economic
   situation.

   But as of this weekend, the situation is going to [31]get a lot worse
   for about 70,000 out-of-work residents. Having bought into the cries
   for austerity, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory and the legislature made it
   a priority to slash unemployment compensation in February. As a result,
   North Carolina will be the first to lose a lifeline for the long-term
   unemployed--the Federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program.

   That 100 percent federally funded program was enacted because of the
   Great Recession. It extended the period of time jobless Americans could
   collect compensation checks to as much as 99 weeks in the worst-hit
   states. Nationwide, 1.7 million Americans still receive compensation
   under the EUC. Unless Congress acts, which seems highly unlikely, the
   entire program expires Dec. 31 this year. But North Carolina is bailing
   six months early.

   The reason North Carolinians will no longer be covered under the
   federal program is because the legislature cut maximum compensation of
   the state unemployment program to $350 a week. Under the provisions of
   the EUC, no such cuts are allowed without a federal waiver, which North
   Carolina did not obtain.

   The stated rationale behind the cuts? North Carolina [32]owes the
   federal government $2.1 billion it borrowed to cover payments when it
   ran out of money in the state compensation fund because of the severity
   of the recession. The goal is to pay off that debt by 2015. Nineteen
   other states also borrowed money from the feds to cover holes in their
   compensation funds.

   Altogether, between now and 2017, the North Carolina legislature's
   fiscal research office says, the state will save $3.6 billion from
   compensation cuts and an additional charge to businesses of $42 a year
   for each employee. Of the total, 74 percent of the savings will come
   from cuts in worker compensation.

   Not only did the legislature whack how much an eligible jobless person
   can collect each week--the average is $292.60--it also cut how long a
   person can collect payments to 20 weeks from the 26 weeks every state
   has provided compensation for the past half-century. If the
   unemployment rate falls far enough in North Carolina, the maximum
   compensation period will be reduced to just 12 weeks, the lowest in the
   nation.

   The package of cuts was originally the work of the North Carolina
   Chamber of Commerce, the state's main business lobby.

   Please continue reading about the situation in North Carolina below the
   fold.

   So, in two days, those eligible for compensation in North Carolina can
   collect a maximum weekly payment of $350 for a maximum of 20 weeks.

   Then nothing.

   For comparison, New Jersey, whose official jobless rate at 8.6 percent
   is just barely under North Carolina's--and also owes the feds money it
   borrowed because heavy, long-term unemployment had drained its
   compensation fund--the maximum weekly check is $624 for 26 weeks from
   the state fund and 47 weeks from the federal EUC.

   In the Tar Heel State, it's going to be grim going for those 70,000:

     Wayne Bostick, 58, of Raleigh, said he lost his job in April 2011
     and will lose extended federal benefits immediately. He said he
     earned about $700 a week in take-home pay, often working double
     shifts at a ConAgra Foods plant until it shut down after a fatal
     explosion. Since then, he said, the only jobs he's found matching
     his skills pay less than $10 an hour and are outside Raleigh. Now
     he'll have to revisit those or start a handyman business.

     "I'd rather do that than bring home $200" after commuting and taxes,
     he said. "They are really putting the gun to your head now."

   But to the state's lawmakers, the plight of Bostick and 70,000 other
   out-of-work citizens makes no never-mind.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [55]Civil
   Rights, [56]Community, [57]Congress, [58]Culture, [59]Economy,
   [60]Education, [61]Elections, [62]Energy, [63]Environment, [64]Health
   Care, [65]International, [66]Labor, [67]Law, [68]Media, [69]Meta,
   [70]National Security, [71]Science, [72]Transportation, or [73]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([74]California, [75]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       Seriously, more people I know that are on the left side of the
       spectrum can't stomach the thought of fucking over other people.
       On the other side of the spectrum they don't even see us as
       people... or worse "The Damned"
       So they don't care who they fuck over. It's their nature.

   Here's a couple of "real unemployed people in North Carolina stories"

   [339]Lee Creighton depends on his elderly parents to buy him groceries
   to eat in weekly trips to Wal-Mart, something the 45-year-old with a
   doctorate in mathematics never imagined would happen.

   There are over [340]400,000 unemployed in NC.

   From [341]this link:

     I am 29, I recently finished law school and was working my first
     attorney job when i got let go. I cannot find a job for the life of
     me.  It took me over a year to get a law job as it was... part of me
     wishes i never made the mistake to go to law school.

     I doubt Anything will happen.. I'm a full time college student, and
     Veteran.. My benefits end on Dec. 29th.. I don't know what to do!!
     College costs a fortune, And trying to find a job is hopeless! What
     is a guy to do this day in age.

     The unemployment rate in North Carolina is 9.3 and has been for more
     than 3 years, there are no jobs here not even minimum wage. Everyone
     is fighting for the same Wal-Mart jobs.

     I, too, have put in - check this out - 1,119 applications since
     becoming unemployed in November 2011. I definitely feel everyone's
     frustration.

   It's difficult to be happy knowing so many suffer. We must unite.

       It's all because you did not get the training you need or because
       you didn't work hard enough.  It's always you fault even when there
       are no jobs to be had.   It's your fault when business hire their

   Historically, the Southern states have limited their public benefits :
   health, education, and welfare ... not to mention justice and  civil
   rights ...  precisely so that the "surplus population" would move in a
   northerly direction, where there were both more benefits and more
   opportunities.

   In case no one has noticed, Justices Roberts and Scalia are GREAT
   admirers of States Rights.  Not as much as they admire Corporate
   Interests ... but it wouldn't be a great stretch to label this court
   "The New Anti-Federalists."

   Personally, I think of them as "treacherous, disloyal, Confederate
   Revanchists ... "

   But ... the South has already "risen again" and it occupies the House
   -- without any of that foolish bombardment and secession whoop-de-do.

   (The Southern Conservatives KNOW how dumb national Democrats can be  --
   they used to BE them.)

   Look up "Moral Mondays" and diaries about it here.  I think we are up
   to more than 500 people who have been arrested and thousands showed up
   last week.  But our legislature has been very clear that, frankly, they
   just don't give a damn what we think.  ALEC and the Koch brothers'
   brother-in-hate, Art Pope are who our legislature works for.  The
   people are there to pay taxes so they can spend those taxes for the
   benefits of themselves and their rich corporate friends.  And to work
   for slave wages to increase their profits.

       is.  The 2010 election gave the GOP the ability to gerrymander
       democrats right out of contention.  There is a lawsuit challenging
       it but our appellate courts are GOP/tea party controlled now too.
       It's a dismal situation.  The only "bright spot" is that GOP

       I wish more commentators would speak to this.  My state of NC is a
       purple state with probably a 1 to 2 percent Republical lean at this
       point.  We went for Obama in 08 and for Romeny by only 2 pts in 12.
       Obama's handling of the health care reform is killing us.  By
       letting it drag on so long and impact the 2010 elections, it gave
       the Republicans here a chance to expand their slim majority in the
       legislature just in time for the 2010 redistricting.  The
       Republicans used advanced street-level statistical analysis to
       gerrymander the districts like never before.
       That gave them a veto-proof majority in the 2012 elections, despite
       the same near-even vote split.
       Because of the effectiveness of the gerrymandering, it'll probably
       take us 10 years to dig back out of this.  There is no way NC will
       be blue in the next couple presidential elections because this
       legislature is setting up too many voter blocks.  They are
       shrinking early voting (NC was a national leader) to almost
       nothing.  Democrats had huge leads in early voting.
       It's sad, but time is on our side.  This state is trending blue and
       will overcome even the gerrymandering and voter suppression given
       time.

   Maximum benefits are $240 a week. Maximum duration of benefits is
   approximately 60 weeks (maybe as high as 63 weeks), even with the
   federal extension. (Hard to pin down a number.) But maximum benefits

       the conservative cabal has been way ahead of us in planning for
       this.  NC and Wisconsin were states where people felt comfortable
       that progressive policy was making...well..progress.  The true
       conservative overlords planned their strategy for decades and
       implemented it slowly.  And while they do that liberals tear each
       other apart over candidates who don't address everybody's issues.
       For instance, for decades abortion wasn't an important part of the
       GOP platform.  Yet the forced birthers never threatened to support
       third parties or to withhold their votes over it.  For a long time
       it was there but only in a wink and a nod role.  They didn't desert
       their GOP politicians when they failed to live up to their promises
       to ban abortion.  But now, because they were loyal and
       conservatives have taken over state legislatures, and because they
       have been able to appoint their federal judges and Supreme Court
       Justices, they are in a position to make us fight once again for
       something that most of us thought we already had.  The long game of
       loyalty is paying off for those people who probably thought they
       were "having to hold their noses and vote for the least bad
       candidate".  Only recently has the GOP had to deal with the problem
       of a segment of their base refusing to support the party overall
       unless their conditions were met.  And it's starting to destroy
       their party.  I'm not so much blaming people for not supporting
       democrats as I am saying that we have got to learn to pull together
       and look at the long game.  Of course we don't have single payer or
       real, green environmental  policies, but if we refuse to give them
       an inch we can keep building on what we do have until the time that
       we have the State legislatures-- and most importantly the courts.
       Then, just like the forced birthers now, we will be giddy with the
       kinds of progressive policy we see popping up everywhere.  And they
       will be reeling from the shock of seeing things they thought would
       never happen starting to get done.

   This basic safety net of understanding has been lost, and the only way
   we will ever get it back is unfortunately through massive suffering by

   in NC. Yes, there are a lot of meatheads here - just as in your state,
   I'd imagine - but this is a truly purple state.

   The Republicans got barely over half of the votes for state legislature
   positions and they have huge majorities. They can play the system, and
   they don't give one half of a damn what the people of the state think.

   It's not noted in the diary, but at the same time they're trying to cut
   corporate taxes and put sales tax on items such as medicine and food.
   It makes me sick to think about.

       came from the state electing Republicans to power.... and first

       control continues.
       People.... "people"... in general nationwide seem to have a
       disconnect between local/state politics and reality. Like it
       doesn't really count some how.
       It stems from the failure of education, which was undermined
       systematically by the Republicans over th elast 40 years.... to
       this end. Make the people ignorant, then exploit that ignorance...
       it works, sad to say.

   Filed for UE last week.

   UE in Georgia is heinous.

   At no time have I heard 1 person in UE express anything remotely like
   "Oh dude, we;re sorry you got laid off".

   It is a constant negative drum beat about fraud, fraud, fraud. As if
   one manages to get laid off to live La Dolce Vita on $330 a week. I get
   19 weeks.

   I have to make 3 'job contacts" a week. That has been sticking in my
   craw.

   It is a really stupid, stupid requirement.

   How many people are laid off in Ga right now? I am unsure but lest's
   say 400000.

   400000 people EACH need to make 3 'job contacts" a week.

   That is 1.2  MILLION job contacts per week JUST for Georgia.

   Nearly 5 million per month.

   Indiana has basically the same rules so that is approximately 10
   million job contact to be made PER MONTH in just 2 states. in 6 months
   that is 60 million  job contact.

   add 2 more states with that calculation and that is 120 million Job
   Contacts over a 6 month period in 4 states.

   120 million is 1-freaking-third of the nation's population.

   Am I alone in thinking this is well-beyond preposterous?

   Further

     I have a piece of paper from them
     specifically telling me I didn't earn anything and I am costing
     people poor ol employers  money.

     Unemployment insurance is financed WHOlLY by an employer payroll
     tax: no part is paid by the worker.

   I have been approved for only 19 weeks and they won't pay you for at
   least 2 weeks.

   They treat me like a criminal.

   They totally make whoopee with their moms.

       it was also 3 contacts a week.. I sent out over 400 resumes during
       the 15 months I was unemployed.. A lot of the time the resumes just
       went into the black hole of HR departments. Several of my friends
       had also been laid off, we were all applying to the same jobs.  One
       job at a large manufacturing company had a job that you didn't need
       an engineering degree to qualify. 200 plus resumes for that one
       job.  IT is insane. Luckily I found a job that paid 20% less than I
       made prior to being laid off but I have a job.  Good luck..  I
       understand and you have my sympathies.

       I was listening to a story about a city here in North Carolina
       which was just listed as having the fifth highest rate of property
       theft in the country. A lot of folks are scratching their heads
       about it, but one of the elected officials has been trying to point
       out that it's one of the poorest areas in the state, and with the
       economy as bad as it is, people are starting to break into other
       folks' houses for food. That's how bad things have gotten in this

       (2011 / North Carolina) [1238]Man robs bank to get medical care in
       jail

     a 59-year-old convenience store clerk, walked into a Gastonia, N.C.,
     bank and handed the cashier a note demanding $1 and medical
     attention. Then he waited calmly for police to show up.

     He's now in jail and has an appointment with a doctor this week.
     Verone's problems started when he lost the job he'd held for 17
     years as a Coca Cola deliveryman, amid the economic downturn. He
     found new work driving a truck, but it didn't last. Eventually, he
     took a part-time position at the convenience store.
     But Verone's body wasn't up to it. The bending and lifting made his
     back ache. He had problems with his left foot, making him limp. He
     also suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis.
     Then he noticed a protrusion on his chest. "The pain was beyond the
     tolerance that I could accept," Verone told the Gaston Gazette. "I
     kind of hit a brick wall with everything."

   I used to live in Raleigh, volunteered on Kay Hagen's Senate campaign
   and Obama's campaign in 2008.  It was wonderful seeing the state turn
   Blue, and also have Bev Perdue win the Governer's seat.  I moved away
   in late 2009, because of the economy.

   It's sad to see how things have turned around so quickly.  The people
   of NC deserve better, and I hope non-conservatives can rally and start
   changing the tide back.  I saw first hand in 2008 how with a huge
   effort, liberals can gain the upper hand.

   I don't know what happened.  Perhaps people became complacent enough to

   When so many Democrats "stayed home" as the Obama folks refused to use
   their machine to help propel their agenda into the states, we lost NC
   to the GoOPers/GOTP.  Art Pope, a Raleigh businessman and owner of a
   chain of cheap merchandise stores (think Dollar Store type) who is
   close friend  Koch friend and follower saw his opportunity to fund the
   takeover of the NC lege and Governorship with cash and support, and he
   did.

   The Democrats ran a nice guy, Walter Dalton against Pat McCrory who ran
   as a "moderate". His advertising claimed that as (I believe) Charlotte
   Mayor he "had to get along with everyone")...hehehe, he played on the
   credulity of the independents by saying that and won the Governor's
   Mansion even though he had no intent of doing anything close to being
   moderate...one of his first acts was to appoint his patron Art Pope as
   "Budget Director" i.e. Shadow Governor.  The Democratic candidate got
   almost not support from the party here, I never saw more than three or
   four yard signs, no rallys, no speeches, no nothing from Dalton because
   his support from the weak-as-a-sick-kitten Democratic Party was about
   this much --->| |<-----

   The GOP legislature then gerrymandered the hell out of the state and it
   will likely stay that way until the next census, unless they GOP
   somehow figures out how to cancel that.  We lost a US House seat, and
   many state legislative seats to GOTP members, whose idea of governing
   is to give as much to their contributors as possible while getting
   reelected.  Example:  The legislature passed a bill essentially saying
   that beach erosion is a myth and the ocean isn't rising, nor will it.
   Makes their real-estate developer contributors very happy.  See how
   this is working?  They even did away with the Racial Justice Act that
   allowed minority inmates to appeal their sentences on the grounds that
   racial motives might have led to their sentencing...McCrory says it
   effectively ends Capital Punishment and so signed it's repeal, again,
   see how this is working?  It's not about Governing and Justice, it's
   about satisfying the Tea Party base and the economic interests who will
   go to the polls for brain-dead pigs as long as they have GOP tattooed
   on their flank.

   It's no surprise that the GOP cut off unemployment, they're hoping that
   the unemployed "deadbeats" will come fix their roofs for cheap/free, do
   their yard work, or just leave the state.  I have to wonder how many of
   those affected voted for these cruel people in 2010 and 2012 because
   they don't like the Black President and don't get the concept of voting
   against their own self-interest (until now).

   It would also not surprise me to  see Michele Rhee's horrid
   "StudentsFirst" corruption and other stuff coming to NC soon as the
   lege decides that public schools suck, teachers are overpaid and
   standardized testing in Biblical Charter Schools rocks it.  Stay tuned,
   it's gonna get worse.

   the same anti-unemployment benefits growd caused this problem as part
   of their [1340]anti-tax policies:

     States are supposed to build up their unemployment accounts during
     good times by taxing employers, based on wages. But their tax rates
     vary.

     Prior to the recession, most states lowered taxes on employers.
     Between 1995 and 2005, 31 states reduced unemployment insurance
     taxes by at least 20 percent, according to the Tax Foundation. That
     brought contributions down to 0.65 percent of total wages from 2000
     to 2009 -- a record low, according to NELP.

   And what would it cost employers in NC to NOT cut unemployment
   benefits?

   [1341]A mere $21 a year per employee.

     North Carolina companies now pay an additional $42 per employee
     yearly to pay the debt. Without the changes, businesses'
     unemployment insurance taxes would rise by $21 per employee every
     year until the federal debt is paid.

   Bank of America is headquartered in North Carolina.

   Heaven forbid BoA use any of the money the FED gives to BoA at almost
   if not NO interest to spare North Carolina families serious harm.

   Speaking of which, DC could trickle a bit of interest rate forbearance
   to states, imo.

   ..what republicans always do; adopted Reagan's failed, proven failed
   [1362]trickle down "voo-doo" economics. [1363]race to the bottom

     McCrory has made cutting taxes the centerpiece of his campaign for
     governor. He has pledged to cut the corporate income tax, the
     individual income tax and the estate tax if elected. Sadly, yet
     predictably, this candidate has also refused to release any details
     about the structure of these proposals, including their bottom-line
     cost in terms of revenues. What we do know, though, is that he'd
     have a friendly audience in the state capital, where GOP leaders -
     who control the legislature - have already proposed the outright
     elimination of personal and corporate income taxes.

   This is from back in January

     "We have to recognize and admit that we have some problems," he
     said, citing the state unemployment rate and competitive imbalance.
     "Our brand of economic prosperity has been diminished."

     Updating that brand will require restructuring the state's tax
     system, especially lowering the corporate and personal income tax
     rates, so that North Carolina can attract businesses and trained
     workers, McCrory said.

   Unemployment? cut taxes

     McCrory will be sworn into office on Saturday, and he said his first
     priority is repaying the $2.8 billion that North Carolina owes the
     federal government for unemployment benefits paid to laid-off
     workers during the height of the recession.

   So to pay off a debt, instead of raising corporate taxes to increase
   revenues, McCrory does exactly the opposite; lowers corporate taxes and
   then cuts off workers who have been laid off.

   And blames PPACA:

     His other immediate concerns involve handling the provisions of the
     Affordable Care Act that will kick in over the next 12 to 18 months,
     such as building a system where people can shop for health coverage,
     deciding whether to expand the state's Medicaid program and working
     with businesses that are considering dropping their employee health
     plans.

   And repeats a Sarah Palin lie that PPACA will cause people to lose
   their employer based health care without remedy:

     "I don't think the people of North Carolina or the people of our
     country really understand the implications of the major changes that
     are going to be occurring with regard to health care," he said.

   It's almost amazing how opposite the republicans "solutions" are to
   what is needed - slashing benefits for workers and giving tax breaks
   for corporations every, single, time.

   And now McCrory is taking his orders from [1364]chamber of commerce

     The state's top business lobby, the North Carolina Chamber,
     primarily assembled the package of proposals that lawmakers adopted.

   And he'll probably be praised as the first to pull this cruel move.
