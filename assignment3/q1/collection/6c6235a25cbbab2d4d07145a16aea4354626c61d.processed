   Researchers report a breakthrough in generating powerful antibodies
   that can neutralize HIV.

   An HIV infection is really an intensive molecular arms race launched
   from the minute the virus infects a new host. AIDS progresses not
   because the body isn‚t capable of fighting off HIV ‚ it is. But the
   immune defenses eventually succumb to the virus in the final standoff.
   Now researchers, led by Barton Haynes, director of the Duke University
   Human Vaccine Institute at Duke University School of Medicine, believe
   they have found a way to tip the odds in the immune system‚s favor.

   From the moment of infection, the immune system goes on alert and
   immediately generates antibodies designed to attach to and destroy HIV.
   And for the first few weeks, these antibodies are successful,
   eliminating all but a few viruses that remain hidden away from the
   body‚s surveillance systems. These viral stalwarts then mutate to
   escape detection and start to flourish, expanding until new antibodies
   are generated to dispatch them. That launches another wave of viral
   destruction that pushes HIV to mutate yet again, prompting another
   immune attack, and so on, until eventually the body isn‚t able to keep
   up with the virus and pushes out poor, or no more additional antibodies
   that can neutralize HIV.

   (MORE: [69]A Newborn May Be Cured of HIV. Is the End of AIDS Near?)

   That‚s the scenario in about 80% of those who are infected with HIV.
   But in a fortunate 20%, this arms race is stacked in the host‚s favor,
   with antibodies that are able to neutralize not just the latest,
   specific mutated version of HIV but a broader range of viral marauders.
   Such [70]broadly neutralizing antibodies are the holy grail of [71]AIDS
   vaccine researchers, who hope to corral these agents in an immunization
   that can protect against infection.

   But most attempts to convince the body to churn out these antibodies
   haven‚t been successful, primarily because the antibodies take on an
   unusual shape that marks them for destruction by the very immune system
   that generated them. In addition, these antibodies can bind to and
   destroy healthy cells as well as HIV-infected ones, making them a
   potentially useful but unpredictable partner in fighting the virus.

   (MORE: [72]Study Explains How the First Effective HIV Vaccine Worked)

   But by carefully mapping the different mutations that HIV generates,
   and the resulting antibodies made against them in an African patient
   who is able to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies, Haynes and his
   colleagues believe they have come up with a way to drive the immune
   system to preferentially churn out these HIV-fighting immune cells. ‚We
   followed individuals from the time of HIV infection to the time they
   generated broadly neutralizing antibodies, and mapped and isolated the
   virus at every step along the way so we now don‚t have to guess any
   more about what induced those antibodies. We have a map on how to
   recreate the sequential [versions of HIV] that could drive particular
   antibody lineages.‚

   The work, which was published in the journal Nature, was possible
   because Haynes had collected and saved blood samples over the course of
   about three years from roughly 400 patients, starting within weeks of
   their infection. Researchers found that the first round of broadly
   neutralizing antibodies generally appeared about 14 weeks after
   infection, and these were better able to bind to portions of HIV that
   the virus doesn‚t change as quickly or as frequently. That makes the
   antibodies useful weapons in attacking the virus's Achille‚s heel, and
   a potentially powerful target for an effective vaccine.

   (MORE: [73]Treatment As Prevention: How the New Way to Control HIV Came
   to Be)

   ‚Now we have a picture of how these antibodies developed, so what we
   are doing is figuring out how to use them to make a vaccine,‚ says
   Haynes.

   The challenge will be to push the body to pump out these antibodies
   rather than the more specific ones aimed at the ever-changing portions
   of HIV. It turns out that most infected people do produce these
   antibodies, but HIV distracts the immune system into crowding them out
   with all the subsequent iterations they convince the body to make
   against the mutating virus. ‚We are trying to take an unusual or rare
   event and make it more common,‚ says Haynes.

   (MORE: [74]HIV Drugs May Prevent Infection in Healthy Individuals)

   Ultimately, he adds, a vaccine will probably need to generate several
   of these broadly neutralizing antibodies; each person tends to make
   unique versions that have differing efficacy in stopping HIV. But
   there‚s precedent for such an approach, since the antiretroviral drugs
   that now control HIV infections are used in combination to hit the
   virus at more than one point in its life cycle. ‚The hope is that by
   mapping individual pathways to generating broadly neutralizing
   antibodies, we can find some commonalities among people even though
   everyone is different, and that gives us hope for using these pathways
   in a vaccine,‚ says Haynes. ‚It‚s a huge effort but it looks like it‚s
   going to pay off.‚

   Using patients own blood sample and used as auto vaccine can stimulate
   antibody formation which can be instrumental in enhanced antibody
   formations which could be ameliorative or curative for HIV infections .
   The enhanced responses have been learned and studied through
   contemporary/ allied medical practices. when no extraneous material is
   used in the procedure and as such being ethical¬
