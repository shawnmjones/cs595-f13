   U.S. Vice president Dick Cheney (L) takes the oath for his second term
   in office from House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R) at inaugural ceremonies
   in Washington D.C. on January 20, 2005. Cheney's daughters Mary (2nd L)
   and Liz (2nd R) watched. REUTERS/Jason R
   ... and, when you consider that Mike Enzi was the 8th-most conservative
   senator [29]in 2012 and the 4th-most conservative one [30]in 2011,
   [31]her explanation makes absolutely no sense:

     "We've got to stand and fight, and we have to defend what we believe
     in. We have to not be afraid of being called obstructionists,"
     Cheney said.

     "In my view, obstructing President Obama's policies and his agenda
     isn't actually obstruction; it's patriotism," Cheney said. [...]

     Cheney didn't give specifics in response to reporters' questions
     about what she believes Enzi might have done to show complicity with
     Obama's agenda.

     But she said, "Instead of cutting deals with the president's allies
     in Congress, we can be opposing them every step of the way."

   In light of his voting record, that would have been a pretty good
   endorsement speech for Enzi, but as a rationale for Cheney's candidacy,
   it's gibberish and fluff. Obviously, the real reason Cheney is running
   is because she feels entitled to whatever she wants. Her dad was Dick
   Cheney, after all! In a way, that's actually understandable: Wouldn't
   you feel entitled to some sort of compensation if you were daddy's
   little draft deferment?

   Seriously, though, while I wish Liz Cheney were more honest about the
   reason for her run, I do admire her willingness to put in the hard work
   necessary to win a wingnut primary. For at least four years now, she's
   taken fifteen minutes out of one or two Sundays a month to appear on
   one of those Sunday talk shows, and that shows dedication. In fact,
   it's probably more than fifteen minutes if you factor in the time it
   takes to apply makeup--not to mention the time it took for her to
   travel from her home in suburban Washington to the television studio.

   Moreover, Cheney is so passionate about taking this job that she moved
   from those suburbs in Virginia all the way to Wyoming just so she could
   run for U.S. Senate. That's a big move! True, it's a bit ironic that
   she made the move to get a job that will allow her to move back home to
   Virginia, but for someone who clearly feels more at home in the swamp
   of Washington than the mountain ranges of Wyoming, that was a big
   sacrifice.

   All that being said, to be absolutely fair to Liz Cheney, the reason
   I'm rooting against her is pretty much the same as the reason she's
   running: Because she's Dick Cheney's daughter.

   [32]7:43 AM PT: It also occurs to me that while Liz Cheney is running
   for a six year term, her entire rationale is about opposing a guy who
   will be president for only the first two years of that term (if Wyoming
   Republicans inflict her upon America).

   [33]7:49 AM PT: Last night on MSNBC, Chris Hayes [34]had a very
   enjoyable tribute to all the reasons why Liz Cheney really is the worst
   thing in the world.

   [46]Tagging tips - [47]Search For Tags - [48]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       that anything they don't like should be nullified - just like all

   I don't recall the statistics, but isn't the "obstructionist Party of
   No" pretty unpopular even among Republicans these days? That's why most
   of them pretend that they're doing some actual legislating, instread of
   just figuring out new ways to obstruct. She apparently thinks
   transparent obstructionism is a better policy.

   Obstruction as patriotism. How can a government function like that?  I
   guess that is the problem.  These people hate government and want to
   INSURE it doesn't function.  Self-fulfilling prophecies are so nice.

   The sequester is the new Republican immigration reform plan. Make

       If it is doing the things they like, making wars, stomping out
       rights other than the Second Amendment, giving away billions to
       "entrepreneurs", then government simply can't be big enough for

       and the companies that first developed and manufactured them such
       as Boeing and McDonald-Douglas.
       A good part of the special was about these companies response to
       WWII. Within an astonishingly short time, these companies and
       others switched to the design and manufacturer of military
       aircraft. The Army needed a long range bomber, they got the B-17.
       They needed a fighter that could protect those bomber wings? They
       got the P-51. Again and again, the men who headed these companies
       put patriotism at the top of the list and when the military needed
       a particular type of plane, prop or jet during wartime, they got
       it, in astonishingly short amounts of time and in huge quantities.
       (Ironically, during WWII, many of those building these planes were
       women.) And when the war was won, these companies went back to
       building planes for commercial aviation.
       Now? The military procurement process is an overflowing tub of
       pork. The Pentagon has a number of weapons systems contracts they'd
       like to cancel, often because the weapons are so far behind
       schedule-- a delay often expressed in terms of years -- that
       they're now functionally obsolete. Case in point? The  contract for
       the 80 Abrams tanks from General Dynamic, tanks that no one wants,
       not the Pentagon, not the generals. So why are we buying them?
       Because cancelling the contract would close down a production line
       at a GD plant in Ohio, and that would cost GD a hundred million
       dollars.  Can't piss GD off....so the taxpayer money--nearly a
       billion dollars worth-- goes to build unneeded, unwanted tanks to
       keep senators and congressmen from Ohio happy.  The days of tanks
       being the decisive factor in war is over....but the corruption and
       waste isn't.
       Freedom has two enemies: Those who want to control everyone around

       The permanent funding of the MIIC, using America's military power

       equality because of her gay sister and is somewhat libertarian on
       social issues, the Cheneys not being noted as religious activists.
        Her husband is a fossil fuel guy so she also probably doesn't want
       any action on global warming, though surely she is smart enough to
       know it is coming and poses real national security challenges.
       Her whole rationale for running is that she is tired of waiting and
       if she doesn't hurry up Kirsten Gillibrand will beat her to be the
       first woman President.

   She's gotta convince Wyomingites that she's one of us, and she's got a
   lot of work to do to accomplish that.  She didn't live in Wyoming at
   all as an adult until about a year ago, and when she did move back she
   chose the Jackson area.  Plus I think her husband and kids stayed in
   Virginia.

   We don't much cotton to carpetbaggers in these parts.  Even if they
   have a famous last name.

        Especially if all achieved via one's own effort, not privilege.
       Serving for a decade in a govt office, to which position she
       ascended by pull, so far as I know, that's not impressive to me.
       Was she known for any accomplishments in that office?  It appears
       she did nothing else in her life, that one could call a job or
       other accomplishment.
       Pulling off face time on Sunday shows and Fox, on the resume of 10
       years in the State Dept--or rather, on the resume of her last

   it's a freaking joke that celebrity Liz Cheney thinks she can just

   Look at Enzi's resume:

     Raised in Thermopolis, Wyoming, Enzi attended George Washington
     University and the University of Denver. He expanded his father's
     shoe store business in Gillette before being elected mayor of
     Gillette in 1974. In the late 1970s he worked in the United States
     Department of the Interior. He served as a state legislator in the
     Wyoming House of Representatives from 1987 to 1991 and the Wyoming
     Senate from 1991 to 1997. During the 1980s and 1990s he worked as an
     accountant and executive director in the energy industry.
     Enzi won a tight primary for election to the U.S. Senate in 1996 and
     was re-elected by large margins in 2002 and 2008. Since his
     election, he has consistently been ranked as one of the most
     conservative members of the Senate. He is the ranking Republican on
     the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which
     he chaired from 2005 to 2007.

       citizen and a legitimate conservative. And he's being primaried
       by.... Liz Cheney. Um, okay.
       It's too bad this happened in such a crazy red state, or else we
       might have a shot at this seat. I almost want Cheney to win so we

       that push he took off, and Lynne wrote some lesbian novels and

   unabashedly be called an obstructionist, to obstruct Pres Obama, and to
   obstruct anyone who might be tempted to work with Pres Obama.
   Senate seats run for 6 years.  What will she do when Pres Obama is
   gone?  Does she have any agenda, any sense of governing and legislating
   beyond "I hate Obama with a white, hot passion"?  I didn't think that
   was the role of the US Senate.  Course, I'm not Dick Cheney's daughter,

   Look, I get it that conservatives loath Obama but he got elected by the
   majority of voters fair and square. More people voted for his policy
   ideas than theirs. Obstructing policies because you don't approve the
   outcome of the election is not patriotism. It's authoritarianism. It's
   the opposite of patriotism. Conservatives are heading in a very
   dangerous direction with this kind of talk.

       President Obama is freaking LOATHED in Wyoming. I voted for him
       while living in Wyoming, and while liberals are viewed as bad, OMG,
       the locals freaked when a black "liberal" was elected. The day
       after the election, the cons were losing their minds. One of my
       students announced he'd be coming for their guns soon. I asked her
       to prove it, and she hated me from the moment forward. Within a
       month, a new gun shop opened in town.
       Don't get me wrong though--there are liberals who live in Wyoming,
       truly courageous people. And also to be fair, though mocked
       ruthlessly, the libs are pretty much left alone in Wyoming.

   As I see it, Cheney's candidacy fits in perfect with the right-wing
   strategy to push the GOP even further to the right at every
   opportunity. No candidate can be right-wing enough for today's GOP
   base. If they are constantly attacking from the right, they can keep
   pushing the party further into nutjob territory. Even if Cheney loses,
   there is no chance Enzi will creep anywhere close to practical
   governance. If anything, expect Enzi to try to out-crazy Cheney, which
   at the end of the day (in the near-term, at least) is a victory for the
   right-wing.

 Liz = last shot of tequila... ([815]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [816]ER Doc

   [817]Jon Lovett, former Obama speechwriter:

     America needs a strong, positive, rational conservative movement
     that appeals to a wider range of voters; that offers market-oriented
     policies and shows a willingness to work with Democrats; that serves
     as a check against the centrist liberal philosophy that is now, like
     it or not, the natural home of the majority of Americans. That is
     the conservative counterweight that would serve America well. But it
     will only be possible if the Republican Party faces its demons and
     the shrill and strange voices that now dominate. Liz Cheney's
     candidacy will help force that conversation, and it is one the
     country sorely needs.

     In the same interview with the Times, Alan Simpson, the former
     senator of Wyoming, said that a contest between Liz Cheney and Mike
     Enzi might bring about "the destruction of the Republican Party in
     Wyoming." Maybe that's right. And maybe that's what has to happen.

     Perhaps the Republican Party needs to hit rock bottom and Liz Cheney
     is the last shot of rail tequila before the conservative movement
     blacks out, wakes up and heads to a meeting.

     One can only hope.

     Liz Cheney for Senate.

       how low the GOP can sink. I have thought several times over the
       last several years that the party had finally hit rock bottom only
       to see it fall even further into the depths of nihilism. It is in a
       death spiral but no one knows where it will lead or how violent it
       will become when all but the deadenders (as Rummy might say) have
       jumped off the sinking ship. I say this as a former GOPer who got
       off that crazy train back during the sad Terry Schiavo situation.
