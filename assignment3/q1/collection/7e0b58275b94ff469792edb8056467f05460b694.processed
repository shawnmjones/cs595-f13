   You've probably noticed that it takes certain kinds of congressional
   districts to elect certain kinds of Representatives. At an instinctual
   level, you can probably guess that a mostly non-white district in a
   northeastern city is going to elect a liberal Democrat, and a mostly
   white district in the rural south is going to elect a conservative
   Republican. Things get a little more complicated with, say, a
   middle-class suburban district in the west; that's the kind of place
   where candidate strength, fundraising, and what the direction the
   national winds are headed all play a role. But there a lot of other
   variables that go into shaping a district's makeup, and those variables
   can tell us something about a district's political potential.

   Why talk about this now, with the next election more than a year and a
   half away? Partly because now is the time when targets get picked and
   candidates get recruited; competitive races don't usually just pop up
   out of sheer will but require a lot of groundwork. But more
   importantly, the Census Bureau finally graced us last month with
   demographic information for the nation's congressional districts.
   Although the most recent Census has been in the books for several years
   now, things got slowed down by the redistricting process (which, of
   course, relies on the Census' initial population figures); they had to
   wait until the new district lines were finalized to be able to
   calculate new district data.

   With access to that data, finally, I initially planned to write a piece
   about the various superlatives in congressional districts (whitest
   districts! poorest districts! best educated districts! and so on).
   That's interesting trivia, of course, but by itself doesn't tell us
   much about how we can reshape the House in 2014 and in future years, so
   I also decided to pinpoint Republicans in the districts with the
   demographic categories that seemed most hostile to them (say, for
   example, the five congressional districts with the highest percentage
   of African-American residents that are still represented by
   Republicans).

   Rather than put up dozens and dozens of tables, though, that left me
   wondering: which variables actually matter the most? Which particular
   demographic categories are most strongly related with whether a
   district tends to elect a Democrat or Republican? That way, we could
   focus on only a few most important categories. So, with that in mind, I
   calculated correlations for each of the categories in the Census'
   release, factored against the percentage the Democratic candidate for
   the House got in each district. Some of the results are predictable,
   but others were a total surprise. Here's a chart of the characteristics
   that had the strongest positive and negative relationships with
   Democratic share of the House vote:

   Positive
   Relationship Correl. Negative
   Relationship Correl.
   Renter % 0.59 White % -0.58
   25-34 y.o.% 0.43 Veteran % -0.49
   Black % 0.38 Some College % -0.32
   "Some Other" race % 0.38 Male % -0.31
   Asian % 0.30 10-14 y.o. % -0.27

   Some of the other things that you'd think might matter turn out not to
   matter much at all. For instance, the correlation coefficient on median
   household income is only 0.02, meaning no relationship in any
   direction. (With correlations, 1 or -1 means a perfectly corresponding
   relationship within the data, while 0 means nothing but random noise.)
   It's tempting to think of the Republicans as the "party of the 1
   percent" and to think of all the Democrats representing blue-collar
   districts in the cities, but stop and think about the number of
   affluent suburban districts that elect Democrats, or the number of
   abjectly poor areas in the Appalachians that elect Republicans.

   Follow over the fold for full discussion on why these factors might
   matter, and the promised lists of Republicans vulnerable according to
   these criteria ...

   So what is it about the percentage of renters (or, more technically,
   the ratio of renter-occupied housing units to total occupied housing
   units) that makes it a decent predictor of Democratic fortunes? In
   large part, it's because it points to urban areas; more people tend to
   rent in urban areas than rural areas. And it takes only a quick glance
   at last year's election results to see that Democratic votes are most
   heavily concentrated in the nation's metropolitan areas.

   Although the Census Bureau will, at some point, calculate what portion
   of a congressional district is rural and what portion is urban, they
   didn't include that in their initial release. (You can see the entire
   data set here in a [31]Google Doc that I assembled.) However, I have
   run the correlation between urban/rural percentage and Dem performance
   in years before, and it wasn't as strong a relationship as "renters" is
   now. (It had never occurred to me to try a "renters" category before.)
   Either that urban/rural divide has gotten more precise (as a result of
   better gerrymandering and/or more self-sorting of Democrats to the
   cities and GOPers to rural areas and exurbs), or else "renters"
   incorporates an extra element that makes it even more powerful.

   My theory is that while it includes urbanites of all stripes, it also
   encompasses the rural poor, while avoiding the heavily-Republican rural
   middle-class (who, because of the relative costs, seem more likely to
   own property than the urban middle-class). You can see that especially
   with the most-renter-heavy district that's occupied by a Republican,
   California's 21st district in the Central Valley, which is represented
   by David Valadao. This district is a mostly-rural area bookended by
   Fresno and Bakersfield that's heavily Hispanic, mostly agricultural
   workers, and one of the nation's poorest districts.

   So, the following three charts of districts are: first, the five
   districts with the highest percentage of renters (heavily focused on
   New York City, unsurprisingly), and second, the five districts with the
   lowest percentage of renters (affluent suburbs with low density and
   mostly single-family homes, particularly in the midwest). And third,
   the five most-renter-heavy districts with Republicans. These are all
   districts with large Hispanic populations, though only CA-21 and TX-17
   are largely rural; they also include inner-city districts in Miami
   (FL-27) and Houston (TX-07).

   The #2 district, Kenny Marchant's TX-24, may be the most interesting
   one: it occupies the suburbs between Dallas and Fort Worth around DFW
   airport. Marchant has never seen much of a challenge before and Dems
   are only beginning to build a bench here, but this is one of the most
   rapidly Hispanic-trending parts of the country. Redistricting (and the
   creation of the adjacent, Hispanic-majority TX-33) may have helped
   Marchant rest easier for a few years, but even his newly-configured
   district is rapidly changing.

                   77   TX-17    Flores (R)       44.5%

   The second strongest factor, and the strongest negative correlation
   with Democratic House vote, seems a lot less surprising: the percentage
   of white residents in the district. It's interesting that "white" is a
   stronger predictor than any other specific race; considering that
   African-American voters went around 95 percent Democratic according to
   exit polls last year, you'd think that might be a stronger predictor.

   However, we're talking about districts as a whole, and there are a lot
   of black residents in rural districts in the deep south where there's a
   Republican Representative. The same is true of Hispanics, who put up
   large percentages in Republican-dominated places like west Texas. The
   absolutely whitest districts, percentage-wise, tend to be in pretty
   thoroughly Republican places, like Appalachia and the rural midwest.
   (You'll notice one exception shows up below: upper New England, one of
   the whitest parts of the country, nevertheless distinctly prefers
   Democrats.)

   Looking at the chart of Republicans in the least-white districts, I
   would have expected the top one to be Gary Miller in CA-31; that's a
   Hispanic-majority district in San Bernardino where Miller won a fluky
   victory thanks to a bizarre outcome in the state's new top two primary,
   where two Republicans wound up advancing thanks to a heavily split Dem
   field. However, he's second behind an unexpected neighbor: Ed Royce in
   CA-39 in north Orange County. This isn't a heavily Hispanic area, but
   the sum total of Asians plus Hispanics in this area is apparently large
   enough to push Royce into first place. Democrats haven't been very
   competitive in this area in the past (it is, after all, Orange County),
   but this part of the OC is rapidly changing and indeed the Dems are
   starting to come alive here (case in point, Sharon Quirk-Silva's
   surprise election to the state Assembly in 2012).

   At #3 is Rob Woodall, who represents Gwinnett County in Atlanta's
   suburbs; this used to be one of the most right-wing areas in the
   country (it's Newt Gingrich's former district) but it's also one of the
   most rapidly changing areas in the country, based on a mix of new
   black, Hispanic, and Asian residents, and former residents
   white-flighting out of there to newer exurbs further north. Right
   behind him are two northern Louisiana representatives in districts with
   large black populations, but not quite large enough to elect a
   Democrat. (It's hypothetically possible to draw an ugly-looking second
   black-majority district in rural Louisiana--in fact, one used to exist
   in the 1990s--but one doesn't seem to be forthcoming.)

                     358  LA-05    Alexander (R) 61.3%

   The factor with the second strongest positive relationship with
   Democratic performance is the percentage of 25-34 year olds. That's not
   too surprising; younger people tend to be more liberal in general, and
   the Millennial generation is, at least for now, a particularly
   Dem-friendly generation. However, you may be wondering why 25-34 year
   olds perform better than 20-24 year olds. Nobody's more idealistic than
   a college student, right?

   Well, again, it has more to do with the districts as a whole than
   individual people. My guess is that 25-34 year olds tend to be out of
   school and newly-employed, and likelier to be in cities or close-in
   suburbs, so their numbers boost, but also get commingled with, the
   overall Democratic lean of urban areas. By contrast, 20-24 year olds
   are likelier to be in college towns, which, while they're very liberal
   pockets, are in many cases surrounded by and balanced out by rural
   areas. (A larger proportion of 20-24 year olds may also still be living
   with their parents, rather than having moved to the big city yet.)

   In fact, here's the full list of what age groups correlate most and
   least with Democratic performance:

    Under 5  5-9  10-14 15-19 20-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-59 60-64 Over 65
    0.07    -0.20 -0.27 -0.04 0.26  0.43  0.17  -0.15 -0.16 -0.26 -0.20

   So what's with the large bulge in the relationship between Republican
   performance and 'tweens (10-14 year olds)? While it's tempting to point
   out the similarities between Republicanism and childishness, there's
   potentially a better demographic explanation, as the children
   themselves obviously aren't voting. Parents with children are more
   likely to have sought out more elbow-room in the suburbs or exurbs. You
   can also see that in the bulge of Republican performance among people
   on the older side of middle age. Note that I'm not attempting to assign
   any causation to the idea that having children, or owning a house,
   somehow "make" you more conservative, simply observing that families
   with children are more likely to be in the suburbs and suburban areas
   are more likely to elect Republicans than, say, urban areas.

   Also worth noting: as much as we like to stereotype Republicans as
   being the party of angry old people--and, indeed, exit polling did show
   senior citizens as one of the GOP's strongest blocs--districts that are
   particularly heavy on the over-65 set aren't as strongly Republican as
   certain other districts. Plenty of seniors still remember the impact of
   the New Deal, or were unionists when labor was stronger, or both.

   At any rate, you can see from the charts below that the districts
   heaviest on the 25-34 year olds are in major cities; in fact, these are
   fairly affluent, largely-white districts within major cities
   (Manhattan, north Chicago, San Francisco). The ones with fewest 25-34
   year olds are, with the exception of a Long Island suburban district,
   all retirement areas in Florida, the four districts that would be on
   top if you ran a list of highest percentages of persons over 65.

   The Republican-held districts with most persons 25-34 are mostly in Sun
   Belt suburbs and yield some familiar names: Kenny Marchant in the
   Dallas suburbs, Gary Miller in San Bernardino. There's one other name
   that stands out, though: Lee Terry in Omaha's NE-02. That's not a city
   that you think of as a real youth destination, but it does underscore a
   pattern that's especially pronounced in Terry's case among House
   GOPers: very competitive races in presidential years, easy races in
   off-years with lower youth turnout.

   The second most significant factor that has a negative relationship
   with Democratic performance is the percentage of residents who are
   veterans. This makes some instinctive sense, since veterans are
   likelier to have the pro-military stances that one associates with
   Republicans. But there are also demographic explanations for that;
   percentage of veterans is for the most part a strong proxy for
   percentage of male residents, which, if you refer back to the very
   first table, is a strong predictor in its own right. It's also a proxy
   for the elderly, as WWII, Korea, and increasingly, Vietnam veterans are
   all in the over 65 category.

   As you can see, the lowest percentages of veterans tend to be mostly
   non-white districts in major cities. Although it's a measure of veteran
   status, not active-duty status, the highest concentrations still tend
   to be around large military installations anyway, where both recent
   veterans tend to hang around and older veterans also tend to retire
   (Virginia Beach, Colorado Springs, Pensacola, Bremerton).

   The districts with the fewest vets that are represented by Republicans,
   again, tend to be urban districts with mostly non-white populations
   (several in Miami, several in California). Staten Island's NY-11, held
   by Mike Grimm, is a bit of an exception; it's mostly white, though it's
   certainly urban.

   Finally, let's look at one more category: the third-most-significant
   category with a negative relationship with Democratic performance. It's
   also the strongest correlation of any category of educational
   achievement. And it's kind of an odd one: the "some college" category.
   In other word, someone who took at least some college classes but never
   received a degree of any sort. That's one I don't have an easy
   explanation for; it may have to do with what the "some college" types
   aren't.

   In other words, the persons with the lowest educational achievement
   tend to also be persons who are poor and/or persons of color, which are
   groups that tend to vote Democratic. And high educational achievement
   tends to correlate with Democratic voting. It's natural to think "rich
   doctors and lawyers, party of the 1 percent, bla bla bla," but in fact
   probably the largest group of persons with graduate degrees in the
   country is public school teachers with M.Eds, a pretty solidly Dem
   constituency. And, at any rate, in the last few decades we've seen
   well-educated suburbanites in general increasingly move toward the
   Democrats, perhaps motivated by the GOP's "Mayberry machiavellian" and
   generally anti-science, anti-progress tendencies.

   That tends to leave persons of middling educational attainment leaning
   more toward the Republicans, creating kind of a U-shaped curve (which
   isn't limited to this kind of demographic analysis; it tends to show up
   in exit polling too):

   Of the districts with the lowest percentage of "Some college"
   residents, they're all in or near northeastern cities; four are wealthy
   districts with some of the highest percentages of persons with
   bachelors and graduate degrees, while the other (NY-07) is heavily
   skewed toward the poorly educated end of the spectrum. Interestingly,
   the "some college" category is at its strongest in the rural west; it's
   a heavily Republican bunch of districts, with Peter DeFazio's OR-04 the
   only exception (a district that's light-blue only because of the
   presence of, ironically, two large universities). In fact, you have to
   work your way through the 22 most strongly "some college" districts
   before you find one that isn't in the west (and that one's in Texas).
   I'm not sure what it is about the rural west that encourages starting
   and leaving college, but it's definitely a trend.

   The list of Republicans in the district with the fewest "some college"
   residents is kind of a mishmash: there are two districts in affluent
   northeastern suburbs that are more skewed toward graduate degrees. Jim
   Gerlach in PA-06 is used to seeing strong challenges, while Rodney
   Frelinghuysen in NJ-11 certainly should, especially since his district
   had to become bluer in redistricting to accommodate Republican plans to
   wipe out one Democratic district. There are also two rural districts in
   Pennsylvania's Appalachian-flavored middle that lean heavily toward
   high school grads, and then there's FL-27 in Miami, which seems rather
   polarized between the well-educated and the poorly educated without
   much in between.

   You may have noticed some of the same districts keep showing up on the
   lists of Republican "outlier" districts: two of them are CA-31 and
   CA-21, which Dems lost in 2012 mostly because of recruiting failures
   and which are at the top of everyone's target list this year. But there
   are some other recurring ones, like CA-39 in Orange County, TX-24 in
   the Dallas suburbs, and FL-27 in Miami, that have never been serious
   Democratic targets before. They might not be targets this cycle either,
   but soon should be, given the accelerating pace of demographic change.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health

   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   I also have to wonder what percentage of renters are also single? I ask
   because President Obama did so well with [179]single voters.

   One of my past professors pointed to an organization that advocates for
   [180]Unmarried Equality. I see that there may be some overlap with your
   data.

   My impression is that this is a population that isn't often talked
   about, yet runs counter to the image politicians like to present that
   we are a nation where the vast majority of households are married. They
   rarely direct their message to single people and may miss the
   opportunity to enlarge their base.

       Canvassing and mailings are done to single family homes.  Apartment
       buildings and complexes are ignored completely.
       I can speak to this as a lifelong renter.  Lots and lots of votes
       could be (and SHOULD be) gotten from targeting renters.

   I got plenty during the last election for our state house race.  It is
   difficult to canvass apartment complexes often, many of the people in
   them no longer have home phones, and mailing is probably one of the
   only ways they can be reached with any level of effectiveness.

 correlation ([256]0+ / 0-)

   Assuming that these are something like linear least squared fit, and
   the correlation is something like r^2, then most of these relationships
   are weak to non existant.  One might argue that the there is a
   correlation to renters, and perhaps an inverse correlation to whites.
   The danger of low correlation is it might just be an artifact of the
   data, or the analysis.  Low correlation is sometimes taken as  r^2<60.

 If someone says "correlation", they mean ([281]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [282]David Jarman

   (or should mean) Pearson's 'r', not r^2. r^2 will be much smaller, and
   indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable
   explained by the independent variable.

   So a correlation of 0.59 for proportion of renters means that about R^2
   = 35% of the total variance of the Congressional vote is explained by
   this variable. That is a huge deal; it makes a big difference. Effects
   this strong are highly significant. So I disagree with the thrust of
   your comment, in addition to the fact that you confuse r and r^2.

 Another aspect to be considered ([313]2+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [314]grubber, [315]CrissieP

       As a landlord (and lifelong democrat), I am quite interested in the
       renter data.  I am very much interested in expanding my business.
       I live in a Red State.   If I can attract dems to my units, perhaps
       I can help turn red states blue.  Likewise, I would consider
       expanding my business to other red districts in other states so
       that I can more effectively attract democratic voters.
       The trick is to find overly blue districts with "excess" voters,
       who may want to spend an election cycle or two turning a red
       district blue.  With an excess of dem voters, this is a tactic that
       is more likely to be available to dems than to repubs, who have no
       voters to spare in the majority of districts.
       Rental laws are somewhat tricky in that I can not legally make a
       renters voting preference a criteria a deciding one in
       establishing, who I will rent to and frankly I never discriminate
       against anyone, since ultimately from a business perspective I must
       choose among those, who best able to pay and be stable renters.
       Nonetheless, I do have latitude to better understand the market,
       since ultimately I want my residences (I rent homes not apartments)
       to provide stability and value to the neighborhoods in which they
       are found.  For numerous obvious and not so obvious  reasons, a
       blue neighborhood is far more favorable to my business than a red
       one.
       Any other landlords out there, who have similar inclinations?  If
       so, have you considered this and if so, what other thoughts might
       one add along these lines?  If any lawyers out there want to pipe
       in, I would be more than eager to hear your thoughts as well.  What
       are the differences in nuance from state to state.
       In most red districts the margins of victory are only a few
       thousand votes, so that given the 10 year cycle for gerrymandering,
       this approach might well doom gerrymandering as a political tactic
       if one can build a sufficient number of like minded landlords (and
       tenants).
       That said, the r value for renters is particularly low and may not
       reflect statistical cause and effect or significant predictor value
       as a single co-variates alone.  This kind of analysis needs to be
       done not univariately for variable, but in a multiple regression or
       multi-block design context.  If one is interested in utilizing
       these statistics for predictive value, one needs to identify linear
       combinations of variables that are most important.  I strongly
       suggest that the author look seriously at discriminant functions
       analysis to identify those linear combinations of co-variates that
       provide the greatest discrimination.
       Huitema (1980) provides a useful look at certain multivariate
       techniques surrounding covariance analysis that are well worth the
       look, especially for categorical variables such as those being
       dealt with here.  The author would do well to check this out, if he
       is not already familiar with these statistical techniques.
       In any event, great post.  Keep up the good work and help make the
       data more readily available so that we can mine it with the hope of
       striking blue.

   While reading it, I kept trying to think of something to add, but David
   covered everything I wanted to say before I got to the comments.

   The only thing I can think to add is that [331]scientist are breaking
   more and more with the Democrats, probably for the same reason teaches
   do.

     One of the great political shifts in the past decade has been the
     move of scientists toward the Democratic Party, a casualty of the
     Republican Party's war on reality. It's not about politics for
     scientists, it's about the fact that only one party accepts
     scientific findings on everything from global warming to
     evolutionary theory to what does and doesn't prevent pregnancy. Only
     6 percent of scientists identify as Republican, whereas 55 percent
     identify as Democratic. In October of 2012, 68 Nobel-winning
     scientists co-signed a strong endorsement of Obama, saying the
     President "has delivered on his promise to renew our faith in
     science-based decision making."

   renters are not registered or their registration is not up to date

       The issue is that some people are much much more responsive to GOTV
       door knocks than others, and the main predictors of GOTV impact are
       variables that don't geographically segregate well (Mostly voting
       history). The people who cut GOTV lists, at least in high level
       races, use sophisticated modeling to make sure you talk to those
       people and not waste your time with the vast majority of people for
       whom door knocks don't accomplish much.
       Also, you also have the issue that 1) Tons of people you meet
       aren't going to be registered to vote (Less of an issue in NH and
       WI because of same day reg), and 2)Unless you're canvassing a black
       neighborhood or maybe a UW dorm room, at least 30% of the people
       you talk to in a blind knock are going to be Republicans. A
       standard OFA GOTV list, on the other hand, would probably be closer
       to 5% Republican.

       Not an efficient idea necessarily, but not bad. Dealing with stats
       and high probability door knocks, you are going to leave a lot of
       potential votes out there. If OFA etc are hitting the high
       percentage targets, random knocks like this helps fill in the gaps.

   Recommended by:

   I live near the UW Madison campus, and blind knocking is way more
   effective than targetting, simply because in wards where voters are
   extremely transient, it's very hard to build effective lists. The fact
   that renters and young people tend to be Democrats means that rental
   housing near a campus will always be strongly Democratic, regardless of
   who lives there. I don't want to not knock on a door because the last
   time it was canvassed in 2010, or (even in the 2012 recall) a
   Republican or a non-voter lived there, because the odds are good that a
   Democrat lives there now.

       We are trying to determine what numbers are predictive.  Imagine a
       variable that means nothing at all, say electric vs gas stoves (no
       idea if it is actually true).  I can tell you the number in all
       districts and then the math has no correlation.  It would give you
       a zero.
       Now, imagine a variable that has everything to do with it and is
       perfectly predictive.  Lets call it percent of voters for the
       Democratic congressional contestant in two way vote.  This variable
       would accurately predict which districts are D and R everytime, the
       greater the percentage the more likely the D wins until you fall
       below 50%, then Republicans win.  This variable gives you a 1.  The
       Republican opposite (voters for R cong ect) would yield a -1.  This
       number perfectly predicts voting because, surprise, it is voting.
       Statisticians look for the variables where the math yields as close
       to 1 or -1 as possible.  I'm not 100% remembering but I think that
       .1 to -.1 are effectively seen as zero.  So that chart is the five
       strongest variables eachway rated from strongest to weakest.  So
       renters is the strongest variable from the census data, beating out
       even white voters, despite being imperfect.

 Look at linear combinations not single variates ([476]0+ / 0-)
       Variables may be relatively more highly correlated than others, but
       not necessarily predictive.  Yes, it seem counter-intuitive, but
       keep in mind that all such variables are likely to be proxies for
       the latent, underlying variable that you seek.
       From your data, it is clear that you really have NO highly
       correlated variables (an r value of .8 or higher would be generally

       You would do much better to understand the associations among
       combinations of your variables and then target those populations
       that best fit that particular combination of co-variates.
       What you are saying you want to do is to perform discriminant
       functions analysis or alternatively principal components analysis
       to better understand the latent variables of most interest, which
       are in this case far more relevant to the prediction of democrats
       than any of your variables alone in a series of multiple
       uni-variate analyses.  This will be especially true if you fail to
       correct for experiment wise error (the more tests you perform the
       greater the probability that you will reject a true null hypothesis
       by chance alone; if you set alpha at 0.05 then 5 out of 100 such
       tests should be expected to reject the null hypothesis of no
       difference by chance alone).
       Use Dunn-Bonferroni or Sheffe tests when multiple comparisons are
       being made, unless you can a priori identify a smaller number of
       tests, in which case Fisher's Protected Least Significant
       Difference Method or Bryant Paulson's modification of Tukey's
       Honestly Significant Difference Method, all of which can be used
       for multivariate designs.
       Discriminant functions analysis provides you with at linear
       combination of variables that provides the greatest prediction.
       Principal components analysis would provide you that linear
       combination of variables that explains the most variance in the

   "Correlation" means that, after many different measurements, it becomes
   apparent that there is a relationship between two different types of
   measurement.  The mathematical "correlation" is a measure of how
   strongly these two types of measurements are related to each other.
   Its value can range from +1.0 to -1.0.  If correlation is positive,
   then as one measurement increases, so does the other.  If the
   correlation is negative, then as one measurement increases, the other
   decreases.  The larger the (absolute) value, the stronger the
   correlation.  If the correlation is zero, then there really isn't any
   kind of relationship between the two measurements.

   In the very first table, one of the measurements here is always the
   percentage of votes for the Democratic Congressional candidate in the
   2012 election.  The other measurements are the percentages of people
   who are renters;  who are white;  who are 25-34, and so on.  We see
   that the largest positive correlation (0.59) with people voting
   Democratic is for people who rent.  So, districts that have a lot of
   renters tend to send Democrats to Congress.  On the other hand, the
   largest negative correlation with voting Democratic (-0.58) is with the
   percentage of white people in the district.  So, the whiter the
   district, the more likely the Congressional Representative is a
   Republican.

   I hope this helps.

   We're all renters in one way or another.

   There are two classes in this country: The Owners and the Workers.  And
   the Owners are constantly finding ways to get the Workers to pay them
   "rent."

   Whether it is interest on mortgages or tax dollars funneled to private
   corporations or a million other ways, we are constantly paying "rent"
   to the Owners.

   Republican masses, it seems, are working class loyalists to the Owners.

   Democratic party members see that the Owners are abusing the workers
   and try to change it.  The problem is that Democratic party officials
   and leading politicians are all Owners too.

       You're correct in your definition of rent.
       But not all rent is bad. Many who don't buy could buy, but use it

       spend to make and keep it rentable.
       Yes, some form of rent is unjust. Like patents: they're an
       artificial monopoly created by the government. The overriding of
       free expression by patents is justified in the Constitution on 18th
       Century economics, which is probably wrong for a lot of patents,
       especially on intangible inventions (like software, and certainly
       ideas like business processes). And then it's perverted beyond even
       the original justification of promoting progress by protecting a
       chance to return on investment for a limited time - the time when
       limited is far longer than necessary, and the time is often
       unlimited. Copyright is even worse, especially in its unlimited
       renewals. These monopolies protect unlimited profits, not progress.
       The rent they enable is unjust and counterproductive.
       But lots of rent is not unjust. And as I said, people whose
       mortgages are paid off are not renters.

 You confuse "rent for a place to live" as the ([579]0+ / 0-)

   sole view of "rent."

   Owners extract rent from Workers in many ways. You don't think taxing
   the poor to transfer that money to the rich is not rent?  Well, that's
   ok with me.  I'm not going argue with you.

   But there is another way of viewing it:

     The concept of economic rent can be generalised as an unearned
     income and need not apply to physical land.

   The wealthy profit most from the beneficial conditions provided by
   public infrastructure, yet every trickle-down tax cut leads to the
   working people paying for more and the wealthy less.  That's unearned
   income too - profiting from an infrastructure which delivers to the
   owners, yet charges the workers to build it.

   There are many other ways of describing rent.  Still paying property
   taxes on your mortgage-free home?  Who benefits the most from those?
   There may be a difference between red states and blue states.

        Recommended by:

       Rent is not merely any "unearned income". In fact, plenty of rent
       is earned. Who paid to build that house I used to rent? Not me. Who
       paid to renovate it when I moved in, and fixed the plumbing? Who
       bought the oil, maintained the boiler? In fact, who bought it and
       raised their family in it when the neighborhood was so bad even I
       wouldn't have lived there, and I've lived in some pretty bad
       places? Not me - my landlord did. Since I didn't, and I wanted to
       live there, I had to pay rent. That rent wasn't unearned: the
       landlord took risks for years, and did work himself, both on the
       house and to get money to pay other workers, including recruiting
       and managing me.
       That's pure rent, and it's not unearned.
       There's other rent than that, including on residences and other
       real estate, that isn't as well earned. But the point is simply
       that "unearned income" isn't a good definition of rent.
       Rent is the cost of using something that you don't own. Earned or
       not, though if you don't own it the rent is earned by the owner
       because they own it and let you use it at your discretion. Only if
       someone expropriates property from you and rents it back could the
       rent be unearned, but it's the expropriation that's wrong. The rent
       is just a perverse consequence that underscores the wrongness of
       the expropriation.
       Taxes are not rent, either. The case of paying for the use of a
       country you don't "own" is not rent, because in fact you do own it.
       Just jointly with so many that you don't directly control it. You
       have to pay for its operations. Property taxes are pretty
       arbitrary, since they're based on old calculations of the
       productive value of the property that haven't been valid for at
       least several generations. But they're not rent. They're the shared
       cost of the shared property.
       Even though the cost of the property includes paying the people who
       disproportionately control the shared property. It's still not
       rent.
       The workers who build it are not charged to build it. They're paid
       to build it. They do also pay to have it built, but that payment is
       by definition a fraction of what they're paid to do anything, a
       fraction of the fraction that is the tax fraction of their income.
       Yes, our tax system is unjust, taxing people more who work more,
       rather than taxing the capitalists who might or might not work as
       much but who do get more out of the system, financially and
       otherwise. Yes, economics have forced more property into the hands
       of fewer owners, while more people rent what they use instead of
       owning it. But not all rent is unjust; not all rent is involuntary
       or the only or best choice; and not all unjust economics is rent.
       As I said, paid-off home owners are not renters, even though they
       might pay taxes. They might even rent things like cars, but most do
       so because they don't get the value out of the property that makes
       the overhead of actually buying (and even maybe reselling) it
       worthwhile. Some people would be better off buying what they rent,
       but don't - but most have the choice, and don't take it.
       So I'm not going to just call economic injustice "rent" and stop
       thinking. The real problem is the bigotry and preferentiality of
       credit that's based on factors other than demonstrated risk of
       repayment. Many who rent can't get loans to buy, though they're
       lower risks than others who get loans. That's a bigger, more root
       problem than the renting.

       There is indeed a lot of talk about "rent". There is a lot of
       economics in there. A lot of economics, not just in this rent talk,
       is just talk - no value, no real sense. Our economy is managed by
       legions of economists whose quality is reflected in the terrible
       state it's been in for generations.
       You point at "[598]Why the Rich Act the Way They Do" as explaining
       "rent". Well, that points to "[599]rent seeking behavior" for its
       definition of "rent seeking behavior", which in turn points to a
       Wikipedia article "[600]rent-seeking". That article is not about
       the rent itself, but about the political economics of rent seeking:
       eg. bribing Congress to require people pay someone else without
       people deriving value from that someone else. It's about the
       bribing, not even about the payment without getting value. BTW,
       that article also says

     A simple definition of rent seeking is spending resources in order
     to gain by increasing one's share of existing wealth, instead of
     trying to create wealth. The net effect of rent-seeking is to reduce
     total social wealth, because resources are spent and no new wealth
     is created.
       Which is false, because the resources spent are paid to someone
       else, so the net "social wealth" (undefined, but evidently just net
       wealth) is the same, not less. So that whole article is both
       riddled with bad economics (and invalid logic), and an irrelevant
       derivative of the actual topic, rent. That's not rent, and building
       a series of DKos articles on it as the basis for an argument
       delivers a dwelling in which I wouldn't let my understanding live,
       even if offered free.
       Now it turns out that in your latest comment you made the
       distinction of economic rent. Which makes it clear that you are
       simply conflating two kinds of rent: economic and contract. All the
       rent I have described is contract rent, the default meaning of
       [601]renting. That is simply payment for use of property one
       doesn't themself own.
       If you want to use Wikipedia as your definitions, you'll have to
       stick close to

     Economic rent typically describes the difference between the amount
     paid for the inputs to a production process and the amount that
     would be paid for those inputs assuming a unitary (or greater)
     elasticity of supply.
       Economic rents use control of the resource to drive its price
       beyond the cost of its use to its owners. It's artificial pressure
       on the supply/demand ratio. It sounds unfair, but it is the basis
       of all profit, including the inconvenience of finding and
       negotiating with yet another supplier. While profit is any retained
       exercisable value beyond mere bare subsistence.
       So yes, some economic rents are unfair. And they lead to rent
       seeking, which is inherently economically unfair. And indeed we all
       are subject to many economic rents when we interact with our
       economy, which even paid off mortgage holders do, and indeed all
       taxes are economic rents.
       But:
       1. That is not the rent I have been talking about in specific
       terms, which you have been saying is economic rent. The rent you're
       referring to is not the rent I have been. And your rent is quite
       obscure compared to my rent.
       2. Not all economic rents are either unfair, or unnecessary, or
       incompatible with progressive values. Taxes are progressive - when
       they're progressive, meaning some are, meaning some economic rent
       is progressive.
       So owning your home protects you from contract rent, as I said
       (though I didn't specify "contract", because that is the common
       meaning of "rent" when talking about home ownership, and what I
       described is "contract").
       Nothing protects anyone from economic rent. And not all of it is
       unjust. Unless you're comparing to say a pure communist or pure
       libertarian society, which you might as well compare to Oz or some
       other magical place.
       I think we disagree only in semantics. But the distinctions between
       economic rent and contract rent, and even moreso between economic
       rent and rent-seeking, are important. Conflating them sees us
       disagreeing, or not even comprehending each other.
       Maybe if we can get the respective terms applied properly to their
       respective definitions we can finds something worth disagreeing
       about :).

       I think the Owners are always conspiring to squeeze more money from
       the Working people in every way possible.
       The times we live in are not so economically different from
       Feudalism.   The serfs pledge allegiance to their giant
       corporations (lords) and the lords pay as little as possible.
       Currently corporations hold record profits and record amounts of
       cash on hand, but there have been precious few raises in wages.
       Small business and independent workers all are beholding to banks
       and suppliers, which all end up being Owners in the final analysis
       (Owners are those very few people who do not have to work for a
       living.  They live only upon the rents they collect whether
       interest on loans they've given, investments, actual real estate,
       etc)
       I don't think I'm stopping my thinking. I just see it as a
       different perspective regarding "rent."
       Of course, I agree with you as to real property, but I also think
       it carries on to "economic rent" which is money transferred from
       the working class to the ownership class in my view.
       For over 30 years, policy has intentionally funneled money to the
       owners.  That is what has to change, but there is no sign that it
       is going to.  After watching video of Obama's neoliberal economics
       speech, I'm sorta depressed.

 More Mutual Correction ([611]0+ / 0-)
       Yes, we're on the  same side. I appreciate a dialectic argument:
       hones both the point and the sharpening tools.
       I suppose that "economic rent" is "rent" since it's a cost paid to
       someone else who controls what's rented, and it's "economic" since
       it's a consequence of the economics (eg. a labor monopoly or a
       government tarrif increasing costs down the line), that's "economic
       rent". But that is so different from "contract rent" that
       economists should use a word different from "rent", and any
       modifier not as redundant as "economic". Semantics is not
       negligible when it confuses.
       BTW, why "YucatanMan"?

 P.S. There's a top of the front page story ([625]0+ / 0-)

   about this right now which is related:  [626]Market didn't redistribute
   wealth upward, it was deliberate policy

     For example, trade policy was quite explicitly intended to place
     segments of the U.S. workforce in direct competition with low paid
     workers in Mexico, China and other developing countries. The
     predicted and actual result of this policy has been to push down the
     wages the bottom 50-70 percent of the workforce to the benefit of
     those at the top. [...]

   Unearned income.

     The government has also helped management against labor by having
     laws that asymmetrically punish workers and management. If workers
     have a strike that is ruled illegal, the case can immediately go
     into court and the leaders of the strike can be thrown in jail. By
     contrast, when management breaks the law to prevent workers from
     organizing, the case goes to the National Labor Relations Board,
     where it can be dragged out for months or even years. Management
     will almost never face imprisonment as a result of its lawbreaking.

   Unearned income.

     In the last three decades the government has allowed banks to merge
     and grow large enough so that they enjoy an implicit guarantee from
     the government. This guarantee provides a subsidy to the big banks
     that has been estimated to be as large as $80 billion a year.

   Unearned income.

   Rent is money extracted to pay the cost and Ownership benefits.

   Doesn't make it representative of the population it represents.
   Aesthetic appeal should never be a requirement of redistricting.

   Actually, if you really want to eliminate gerrymandering, either do

   allotted by how many people are in those districts (not sure if it

 Multi-member districts ([691]0+ / 0-)
       I remember when I was a teen in the 1960's (yes I was a political
       junkie even then) and the courts declared Maryland's state
       legislative districts unconstitutional.  The House of Delegates
       districts hadn't been redrawn in decades and each county got the
       same number of state senators - rural counties on the Eastern Shore
       had the same number of senators as Baltimore City or Baltimore
       County.
       The result, until post 1970 reapportionment, was that most of the
       districts in Baltimore City and the adjacent suburbs in Baltimore
       and Anne Arundel counties had seven representatives.  When there
       are 30 or 40 names on a ballot and you are asked to choose 7 and
       you don't know who all but 2 or 3 of these people are, that, IMO,
       is not very Democratic.
       Since then, the most populated urban and suburban districts elect 3
       delegates, and 1 senator.

   The non-crazy-racist anti-tax section of the Republican Party
   demographic is probably motivated by an ingrained fear and hatred of
   property taxes. That is, suburban semi-rural homeowners who feel,
   rightly or wrongly, that they are carrying the weight of the urban
   centers with spiraling property taxes. This is why the national
   Republicans know they have a winner with a "no taxes, ever" because the
   Democrats are too wishy washy (sold out? different thread) to make a
   statewide argument that a fairer Federal / corporate / capital gains
   tax rate could be ... uh ... trickled down (?) to alleviate state
   property taxes.

   To fight this fight the progressives are going to have to put making
   the social safety net and poverty programs much more efficient on front
   and center as well as defending them and make a coherent argument for
   "speculators taxes" and a fairer tax rate.

   Where Occupy got it wrong (well, one of the many areas) was the idea of
   "the 1%" - it's a bad meme. It's either, per Krugman, "the .1%" - that
   is Wall St excess, or, more depressing but more realistic, it's the 25%
   who aren't in the top 5% but got theirs and don't want to be taxed to
   pay for things like bottom 30% healthcare or housing or jobs programs.

   Until the Democrats can make a credible argument that they aren't going
   to overtax the suburban home owner - worth mid/high 6 figures asset but
   not income - the Republicans will always play this card (as the rest of
   their culture war cards are getting stale)

       because renters do, in fact, pay property taxes.  The tax rate the
       owner pays is a factor in determining the cost of rent.
       The big difference, though, is that the owner gets to deduct the
       property taxes from their income while renters in most states
       simply eat the cost without getting to deduct it.

       Renters can, and do, move. Suburban homeowners feel their property
       devalued by spiraling property taxes. It isn't, but they feel it in
       their wallet.
       For instance, I don't own a car but I technically pay a gasoline
       tax as just about everything I buy is shipped by truck. However if
       the Feds decided to raise the gas tax - which I'd be in favor of
       from a green standpoint - I wouldn't immediately feel it, I
       wouldn't feel singled out.
       From an electoral standpoint arguing that suburban homeowners
       should have a firmer grasp of macro economics is a non-starter as
       well. A misnomer to you is a Republican dominated political

       Owners care more about property taxes because they are more aware
       of property taxes.  When a tax is invisible, or included in the
       sticker, it is much easier not to think about it.  Property owners
       receive a bill.  It might not determine their location choice but

 You Got It Wrong ([748]1+ / 0-)

   Renters pay property taxes - in their rent. Where else do the property
   owners get the money to pay the property tax?

   And OWS getting "the 1%" wrong? That's the part they got most right.
   Now everyone in America knows we're talking about the uppermost class,
   a tiny minority, that's extremely privileged over the 99%, the vast
   majority, in a democracy that's supposed to rule by majority. The
   specific percentage doesn't matter: nobody thinks it's exactly 99:1,
   and most of us get that it's more overwhelming than that. And if you
   don't think the 1%, who collect upwards of $340K income a year, are
   more part of the problem than those plagued by it, you've got a lot
   more wrong about OWS.

   You probably also think that OWS not producing leaders or demands was
   wrong. What makes you an expert on what OWS should have done more
   right? What revolutions have you pulled off?

       I think OWS was/is fine but have opinions about what went right and
       wrong. And I'm certainly not convinced that it was the "movement
       that changed everything". Sorry if that hurts your feelings.
       And what have you personally accomplished lately? Just asking. I
       thought the meme was wrong then, was vocal about it, I think it's
       wrong now. You have a problem with that? Smash the state and I'll
       get back to you.
       Expecting suburban homeowners to internalize macro economics is
       kind of not happening. They, rightly or IMO wrongly, buy the "all
       taxes bad" jive that has been sold to them since Reagan. That's my
       point that it's not THE ONE PERCENT. It's the 25 +/- percent who
       got theirs and don't feel any common cause with the bottom 30
       percent. If the focus is Wall St all the time that crew might be
       reached. Strangely that's coming out of some conservative blocks
       now and the center right Dems might miss the boat. The usual
       suspects of the left - that would include Occupy - are
       demographically much too small. The rest of the country perceived
       the movement correctly as the serial protestors. 30% of this
       country is far right and wants nothing to do with any of that.

 You Have a Lot of Wrong Opinions ([758]0+ / 0-)
       I didn't say it was the movement that changed everything.
       I also didn't say you don't get to have an opinion. I just said
       your opinion is wrong.
       And you didn't hurt my feelings. You're good at being wrong.
       So you go on being wrong:
       Suburban homeowners don't "internalize macroeconomics"? I'm a
       suburban homeowner, I'm in that 25% you're attacking, and I don't
       know about "internalize", but I don't think "all taxes bad".
       Neither did a lot of us who voted for Obama and higher taxes. This
       diary actually says that there was no correlation of a district's
       median income with the party of who its voters voted to represent
       them. You are so wrong.
       OWS was not "the serial protestors". I was down there myself, and
       I'm not a serial protestor. Neither were the majority of people
       down there, including several on DKos who became fairly high
       profile because of it. You are wrong again.
       BTW, your sig disagrees with your opposition to OWS.
       Then you say OWS is counterproductive because "30% of the country
       is far right". Your logic says that if it's not acceptable to the
       far right, or to the rightmost 30%, then it's not happening. HA!
       I'm not going to bother explaining how that's wrong.
       You are so totally wrong about everything you're spouting. Yes,
       you're entitled to think those things. Indeed, you're entitled to
       be wrong.
       But you're not entitled to shoot your mouth off in public with your
       wrong opinions without being challenged. You're wrong. If you had
       any sense you'd keep it to yourself.

       You may be a homeowner (or not, this is the internet) but the
       electoral history since 1980 is on the side of my argument. Reagan
       and on have sold all "taxes" as "evil". Still going on as we speak.
       Dems (and this is a Dem, not OWS, site) have paid a big price for
       not enunciating tax fairness.
       This wasn't supposed to be yet another thread with the valiant
       warriors of Occupy but ...
       It's been generally accepted, including some strange academic
       study, that not only was OWS the "serial protestors" but that is
       how the general public perceived it. I'm basing many my opinions on
       living walking distance from the W in OWS. I was also there. < 1000
       people in a city of 8 1/2 million. A half a block away downtown
       going on as usual. Ipads on one side and meth deals on the other.
       And that was a general media assessment as well. Having been to
       lots of demonstrations - including labor on Broadway that didn't
       get anywhere near the media bubble - I stand by my statement - and
       the academic study - that says "serial protestors" (I include
       myself over the decades)
       My point about the 30% being far right is they look at a bunch of
       (us) hippies and say "You're not the 99%". Had this discussion
       outside of New York City with some Republican (and Independent
       which seemed to mean voting Democrat but not in public) friends.
       Even the sympathetic (working class) Republican was very adamant
       that some yuppies with ipads and street people in Zuccotti didn't
       represent him or his community. He may have been sympathetic to the
       idea of Wall St out of control but that's not the message he or his
       community was getting from OWS.
       So you're wrong. And if you're going to be wrong in a comment
       thread try to stick to the original argument.

 You're Still Wrong ([768]0+ / 0-)
       So you live in Wall Street and your Republican out of towner friend
       agrees with you that OWS was just a bunch of yuppies with iPads who
       all go to all the other protests.
       Sounds like you're just projecting.
       Because for one, "all the other protests" aren't filled with
       "yuppies with iPads". That's not even the corporate media story,
       which is that the "serial protestors" are all commies, at best
       college professors and students, not yuppies with iPads. It's a
       simple contradiction, though I expect that's indeed what Fox News
       portrayed it as in stories mutually exclusive from each other's
       meaning - and from the truth. And I expect that's where your
       Republican friend gets their news, or at least what they repeat in
       public with people "not  from here" like you, because that's where
       people like that get their news and their need to hide how they
       actually vote.
       For another, OWS wasn't just a bunch of yuppies with iPads. There
       were lots of college age and somewhat younger people down there to
       speak out about what Wall Street had just done to their chances of
       being a yuppie with an iPad, or anything else. There were also
       plenty of the permanently disenfranchised, who saw an unusual
       chance to maybe get their lives on the radar of the public in that
       extraordinary event.
       The mass media recognized this was a broad cross-section of society
       engaged in an unusual display, not the "every protest with the
       usual suspects" that the mass media long ago completely ignored
       (despite the public relevance of any given protest). That's why OWS
       got so much coverage, and spread to so many other places. Until the
       mass media directors realized that the spread threatened their
       incumbency, and then the security forces that protect their
       incumbency started beating the OWS people, so the cameras and the
       "this is new" story had to stop.
       So you're wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.
       You were also wrong when you said:
       * I said it was the movement that changed everything.
       * I said you don't get to have an opinion.
       * You hurt my feelings, in a really primitive attempt to win while
       being really wrong.
       * Suburban homeowners don't "internalize macroeconomics" and "think
       taxes bad".
       Even your sig thinks you're wrong.
       And now you're criticize me for "not sticking to the original
       argument". I am sticking to it. But chasing down the various
       spurious factors you introduced so you could work on being wrong
       about everything requires some flexibilty. I guess your whining
       about my chasing your tangents goes along with your equating my
       saying you're wrong with saying you can't have an opinion.
       So here's the core of the argument:
       [769]54% of Americans said they approve of Occupy Wall Street when
       polled just before last year's presidential election. That's over a
       quarter more than approved of Obama, who won reelection handily the
       next month, and people trusted to run the country for another 4
       years.
       You're wrong about everything. And you're getting boring to
       demonstrate as wrong. At least be wrong in a more interesting way
       if you want to keep getting these free corrections.

   I disagree.

   Occupy got it wrong by wasting time occupying places other than the
   ballot box.  Marching in the street, occupying buildings, parks, etc.
   isn't going to do the trick.  What is needed is targeted occupation of
   marginal red districts with excess dems from blue districts, who show
   up to vote in numbers.

   If this were begin to happen in substantial numbers, all of a sudden a
   lot of GOP reps in blue states would become "reasonable".  The irony is
   that in many cases this could be achieved by only moving a few thousand
   a few miles from one's present location, if the movement were organized
   enough.

   The entire concept would scare the bejezzus out of gerrymandered "safe"

       That's either voter fraud or everyone moving. After 2004 it was

       I don't have any big ideas on beating the gerrymander. I'm hoping
       that the centrist Democrats in control of the Senate and WH have a

 About predictability .... ([854]0+ / 0-)

   The correlation coeeficient doesn't speak directly to predictability.
   There is always, except for perfect correlations of 1 or -1, some
   variability.  For a sense of predictability, then, what you want to
   know is how much of that variability you can account for by your
   measures.  In other words, how much does the % of renters account for
   whether a district votes Democratic or Republican.

   The measure to use to answer that kind of question is the square of the
   correlation.  So, if the correlation for % renters is 0.59, then you
   can account for 35% of the variance in Dem voting districts by knowing
   the % renters (i.e., .59 X .59).  For age, the highest correlation was
   .43 so age accounts for 18% of the variance (variability) in which
   party control a district.  When looked at in this way, the
   relationships are not as impressive.  However, that doesn't mean that
   targeting certain populations couldn't affect things on the margins,
   but just that those margins might be quite small.

   And it's worth repeating that correlations do not speak to causation.
   Is there a higher % of renters in Dem districts because Dems tend to
   rent or because Dems are attracted to places with lots of rental
   property?

   Serrano is a leader in the Progressive Caucus. Rangel is a notoriously

   committe that "solved" the Fiscal Cliff by making Bush Tax Cuts
   permanent. Maloney is the 114th most progressive congressmember, and
   mixes some good legislation with a long history overseeing intel and
   other "reforms" that remain out of control.

   That's a pretty mixed bag. While the people in those districts might be
   "good Democrats", they send to Congress over and over again people who
   are more definitely "Democrats" than reliably "good".

   I'm more interested in seeing the demographics that districts have in
   common who send the worst Democrats to Congress. Because political
   change in America comes from primary elections. They are the elections
   with the worst media vacuum. Therefore, they are the natural place for
   Daily Kos to focus its efforts to elect not just more, but better
   Democrats. Get representatives elected in primaries who represent their
   districts better than their incumbents, Republican or Democrat, and
   help them win the general on that basis.

   Yes, it's early. Primaries are just a year away. Now is the time to
   focus on the most effective work Daily Kos and its members can do.

 Excellent Point ([866]0+ / 0-)
       Progressives need to do better at controlling the primaries and
       hence the final political outcome.
       An examination of the census data in terms of searching for latent
       variables that turn out more progressive voters rather than simply
       democratic voters, would be far more helpful to reach the intended
       effect.
       If one is going to look for progress its important not only to look
       at whether a candidate actually can be expected to promote progress
       but also at the rate at which such a direction once taken could
       lead to results.  Certainly conserva-dems are far better than
       republicans, but the trick is figuring out how to get change to
       occur at a faster pace.  One could die before one sees any progress
       at all otherwise.

 The key demographic to disenfranchise ([877]0+ / 0-)

   The Rs need to do some serious disenfranchisement, and soon, if they
   are to avoid being swamped by the demographic tide.  Yet they can't get
   their controlled state leges to directly disenfranchise by race, both
   because of the XVth Amendment and because of publc opinion.

   But property qualifications for the franchise are clearly
   constitutional.  Most states had them in the beginning.  They got rid
   of them, but not because of any federal law or amendment that made
   states give up property qualifications.  Obviously, keeping the working
   poor from voting would be a huge benefit to the othe side.

   But if the courts can't keep the other side from having their red
   states do this, keep the working poor from voting, then public opinion
   would keep them from doing this.  All the states quit having property
   qualifications for voting because public opinion evolved, and made such
   laws unacceptable to a consensus of public opinion.

   Well, for one thing, that consensus has been broken.  It is now one of
   their memes that a big chunk of the electorate, the 47%, and all those
   urban voters, are moochers who cannot be trusted to vote in their
   country's interests because they are too busy voting their own
   interests in the continuation of the welfare state.  Restricting the
   franchise to keep it out of the hands of the moochers might be
   acceptable to their voters.

   Sure, doing anything against any group of potential voters is risky
   business.  You motivate them to go to the polls to throw you out.  But
   disenfranchisment is the one bad thing you can do to a voter that
   avoids this risk.  Successfully disenfranchising a big chunk of D
   voters could work.  But they would still much prefer that
   disenfranchising the poor not be baldly and openly a disenfranchisement
   of the poor.

   This is where disenfranchising apartment dwellers comes in.  It
   actually would work much, much better for them, as the post explains,
   than disenfranchising on the basis of income or property ownership
   levels, since the rural poor tend to vote for them.  But besides being
   the best discriminating factor to use to target an effective
   disenfranchisement, it's much better PR than targeting the working poor
   directly and openly, in those terms.

   The way they'll get at it will be as a voter fraud prevention issue.
   They will vote in length of stable address as a criterion, perhaps
   combined with automatic registration of the addresses of home-owners,
   but a requirement that apartment dwellers jump through complicated and
   expensive hoops to confirm their place of residence.  Between those two
   sorts of measures, all but the wealthiest apartment dwellers, the one
   type of apartment dweller who migh vote R, could be effectivel
   disenfranchised -- all without the laws that accomplish the
   disenfranchisement having to say anything openly about taking away the
   vote based on wealth or income.

       If the US were more homogeneous and the constitution not so
       constructed this might be something worth arguing for, but from a
       practical political perspective its very much a waste of time.  We
       need to play the hand we are dealt to the best of our ability,
       which shouldn't be that difficult given that the numbers are
       actually in democrats favor.  We need to better motivate democrats
       to more focused progressive goals that are more immediately
       achievable so that a momentum for progress can be established.
       Certainly mobilizing renters, should they actually prove to be a
       favorable demographic for dems, could be a good priority.  I have
       no problem with this as I am a landlord.  A healthy, fair, and
       stable rental market is good for landlords as well as renters.  We
       need to spend less time on the us versus them aspects and better
       sell progressive wares as the logically better alternative.

 We don't get to choose if there's a fight or not ([885]0+ / 0-)
       We only get to choose whether to fight back or not.
       Politics isn't a cooperative venture.  One side wins and gets to
       implement the policies it thinks are best, while the other side has
       to suck eggs, at least until the next election.  Except that the
       other side has shown quite a bit of interest lately in insuring
       itself through disenfranchisement against having to pay any price
       at the next election for policies it seems to know will be horrible
       for most of us.
       Politics is nothing but us versus them.  We were spoiled after the
       New Deal destroyed the other side, by two generations of RINOs who
       didn't dare fight against the New Deal because FDR had so
       thoroughly beaten them into submission.  They gave up after they
       couldn't beat Truman with Dewey, and turned to a New Deal Democrat
       to switch parties and run as a RINO to save the party from total
       irrelevance.
       Those days are over.  Their side is no longer ashamed or afraid to
       declare that the New Deal and the Great Society are socialism that
       must be destroyed.  Two generations of fake bipartisanship are dead
       and gone, and our politics is back to being a fight.  Well, their
       side is fighting.  We seem to still imagine that, any day now, the
       other side will calm down and go back to being RINOs -- and all we
       have to do to make that happen is to not get too excited or too
       negative.

   I agree with you regarding the demographic changes. One of the reasons
   that I don't think this district will change is because it is
   surrounded almost entirely by the white Evangelical population, a large
   portion whom happen to be renters. Land and cheap apartments abound.
   Churches hold great influence in this area and the "don't mess with
   Texas" attitude runs strong. While there are bright spots for D's
   (Wendy Davis and Marc Veasy), it will be a long time IMO before the
   winds change here.

   Linking it with the suburbs makes sense, but might it also reflect

   The key thing is we have to be willing to look at more than than just
   the last election results or the partisan voting index when looking for
   winnable races. we have to be willing to see if other factors suggest
   districts we've been overlooking, and we should apply this to other
   offices than just the US House, though I get that the point of the post
   is seeking a way to win a House majority.

   Longer term, looking at demographic groups rather than states or
   districts where we're weak might suggest trying to win more of those
   groups, presuming that will make more districts competitive.

 Apparently former Representative Tom Davis Agreed ([939]1+ / 0-)

          [940]MichaelNY

   From his Wikipedia page:

   Smart growth development

   Davis also appeared at a local zoning meeting to oppose a smart growth
   plan near the Vienna Metro station. Approval of the project, to build
   what was called a "mini-city" within walking distance of the Metro, was
   considered routine. Some of the longest commutes to work in the nation
   begin in Virginia - second only to New York City -- and in Prince
   William County in particular.[22] The project was a key resolution to
   congestion in the congressional district. Davis's pledge to approve the
   legislation led several county supervisors to accuse him of meddling in
   a local land-use issue.[23][24]

   One politician who spoke to Davis says the congressman told him that he
   opposes Pulte Homes' MetroWest project because "all it does is produce
   Democrats."[25]

   In July 2006, Davis wrote a letter to Virginia's then-Governor Tim
   Kaine discouraging the state from constructing an underground Metrorail
   through Tysons Corner. According to a July 17, 2006 story in The
   Washington Post, Davis said switching to a tunnel in Tysons would
   require reviews that could delay the rail line by as much as two years.
   On February 26, 2007, The Post reported that Davis switched positions.
