   U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis visits San Francisco. Tuesday, July
   24, 2012. &nbsp;Photo by Jessica Brandi Lifland for the U.S. Department
   of Labor.U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis speaks at a labor rally at
   Union Square in downtown San Francisco. Ab
   Outgoing Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis had a big job just [30]turning
   things around from the anti-worker neglect of the Bush administration.
   As she tells The Nation,

     This was, in essence, one of the agencies that really did not have
     sufficient support by the previous administration. In fact, I heard
     story upon story that when people would call in to make complaints
     that they weren't being paid appropriately or were being terminated
     unlawfully they would not be acknowledged. They went in some file.
     Investigations weren't being done. We changed that. Went out to work
     with different stakeholder groups, did it more strategically, looked
     across the board and began to systemically go after the most
     egregious violators. It sent a message. I'm happy, because as a
     result you see more people getting their back wages. We have a
     record for providing $280 million worth of collected back wages for
     more than 300,000 workers. And that's just a beginning. It's
     historic.

   Solis will be missed; her experience is also an important reminder of
   ways presidents affect workers' lives that don't tend to register much
   in campaigns.

     * No, high unemployment isn't about workers not being good enough,
       [31]it's about an incomplete recovery.
       Bar graph showing unemployment rates for different levels of
       education in 2007 and 2012. Unemployment goes down as education
       levels go up, but unemployment is significantly higher in 2012 than
       in 2007 at every level.
     * Work is going to be more likely to pay what it should in Chicago
       soon, as the City Council passed a [32]new law cracking down on
       wage theft, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel has said he'll sign it. While
       wage theft--paying less than minimum wage, failing to pay overtime,
       or otherwise not paying workers money to which they're entitled--is
       already illegal, under the new law businesses could actually have
       their licenses revoked if they're found guilty. Josh Eidelson
       reports that:

     The major showdown over the new law occurred in committee hearings
     prior to Thursday's vote. Adam Kader, the Workers Center Director
     for Arise Chicago, said supporters mobilized a "major show of force"
     from workers and community activists. Kader said opponents brought
     "a significant show of force by all of the major industry lobbyists
     in the state of Illinois." But after agreeing to a change in the
     bill's language, specifying that businesses could have their
     licenses revoked only after willful or egregious violations, labor
     was able to win over the council's holdouts -- though not the
     business lobbyists. (According to the Chicago Tribune, Alderwoman
     Emma Mitts, who chairs the relevant committee, last week said she
     was hearing from business leaders concerned that they would be
     unfairly punished for honest mistakes in how they calculated their
     workers' pay.)
       The big question now is how aggressively the law will be enforced,
       but at least businesses know that there's a real danger to not
       paying workers money they've earned.
     * Examples of how austerity is imposed on those at the bottom while
       those at the top do very well thankyouverymuch [33]don't come much
       clearer than this: at Gatehouse Newspapers,

     We will no longer be able to supply coffee service in our newsrooms.
     We will use up whatever supplies are currently on hand. I suggest
     you bring in a mug or your own disposable cups. We do have a drip
     coffee machine available, if you wish to collect for, buy supplies
     and brew by the pot. Please ask me or Diana for a machine. [...]

     We will not be replacing general office supplies in the short term.
     Please conserve use of paper for copy machines. There really is no
     need to print 10, 20 30 pages of materials which can be downloaded
     or aren't vital to story reporting or page proofing. Please also
     consider absolute need before printing in color.
       But meanwhile, the company's CEO got an $800,000 bonus. That's
       quite a lot of coffee and office supplies.
     * The Wall Street Journal is [34]super-concerned about poor single
       mothers making just $260,000 and what's happening to their taxes.
       It's horrible, people, just horrible!
     * The push to privatize public education is so strong in some states
       that state legislators have been kicked off of their legislatures'
       education committees in both [35]Mississippi and Tennessee for
       opposing it.
     * [36]Speaking of charter schools:

     A CREDO study on Michigan released this week found that 80 percent
     of charters perform below the 50th percentile of achievement in
     reading, and 84 percent perform below that threshold in math. On top
     of that, according to the National Association of Charter School
     Authorizers, 26 percent of Michigan charter schools fall into the
     bottom 15 percent of the state's schools on 8th grade math exams,
     and 21 percent in 8th grade reading.
     * [37]Ugh, awful people:

     The Florida Chamber of Commerce said Wednesday that one of its top
     legislative priorities this year would be blocking local governments
     from adopting paid sick-time measures such as the one pending in
     Orange County.
     * Oh, the ownership society. Where each of us is free to get rich on
       our own without any of that pesky security that comes from having a
       stable pension. Where we get to supplement our inadequate incomes
       [38]by draining the accounts that are supposed to provide for us in
       our retirement:

     More than one in four American workers with 401(k) and other
     retirement savings accounts use them to pay current expenses, new
     data show. The withdrawals, cash-outs and loans drain nearly a
     quarter of the $293 billion that workers and employers deposit into
     the accounts each year, undermining already shaky retirement
     security for millions of Americans.
       Isn't it great?
     * How you get to a school that education officials [39]rate highly
       even as it fails.
     * [40]Cutting out the Starbucks run will not fatten your bank account
       like personal finance "experts" tell you.
     * Remember the [41]Maine labor history mural that buffoon Gov. Paul
       LePage had removed from the state's Department of Labor? It's now
       back on public display, at the Maine State Museum.
     * A Washington, D.C., principal walked in on what appeared to be
       [42]staff changing student answers on a test. She reported it to
       officials. It wasn't investigated.
     * I don't know what is the least stressful job in the country, but
       [43]this CareerCast explanation of why college professor is
       supposedly the least stressful is ludicrous. CareerCast claims that
       there's ample demand for college professors, that they're highly
       paid, and that they have long vacations and short work hours. There
       may be a lot of demand for adjunct professors, but they're
       typically paid very little and have to teach a whole lot of classes
       to make a living. People with tenure-track jobs, meanwhile, may (or
       may not) spend less time in the classroom, but the less time
       they're in the classroom, the higher the expectations for their
       research. And if you think the time spent in the classroom is a
       meaningful fraction of the work hours a college professor puts in,
       you've got no business writing about careers. The Harvard
       professors cited for their high wages, meanwhile, represent a tiny
       fraction of the people in the profession. So basically, if you ever
       come across a claim from CareerCast, dismiss it.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [63]Tagging tips - [64]Search For Tags - [65]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [66]Civil
   Rights, [67]Community, [68]Congress, [69]Culture, [70]Economy,
   [71]Education, [72]Elections, [73]Energy, [74]Environment, [75]Health
   Care, [76]International, [77]Labor, [78]Law, [79]Media, [80]Meta,
   [81]National Security, [82]Science, [83]Transportation, or [84]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([85]California, [86]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       for now and that her replacement will follow her good example.

 So who is on the short list to replace her? ([178]0+ / 0-)

   Rosa L. DeLauro was mentioned for the gig in 2008, could she get
   confirmed by the Senate or considered way too liberal?  Given the Dem
   House is likely to be in the minority for the next decade, she might be
   open to the move to be Labor Secretary for four years.

   I think the GOP would block her though.  So Pres Obama would need a
   scarier Plan B option to encourage the GOP to confirm Rep. DeLauro.
