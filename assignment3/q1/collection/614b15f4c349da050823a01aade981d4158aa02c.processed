[22]Daily Kos pub trivia: When was Newt Gingrich's historic day?

   Delving into the Twitter archives, [29]here's a good one from ol'
   Newticle:
   [30][Newt_Approved_Headshot_normal.jpeg] Historians will look back on
   today's House votes to repeal employer mandate and individual mandate
   as beginning of the end for Obamacare.
   -- [31]@newtgingrich
   Now, don't cheat and, like, click on links. That's strictly against pub
   quiz rules! But the question is: Given that there have been at least 39
   or so possible occasions when Newt could have said this, in what year
   did he do so? Hint: He may be stuck in a time warp. On the moon. Answer
   in the poll below!

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [46]Tagging tips - [47]Search For Tags - [48]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       What terrifies Republicans the most is of course that the
       Affordable Care Act will be successful. That's why they keep
       trying, impotently, to tear it down like a dog gnawing on granite.

   but I was actually thinking "all three years." Poor Newt, like so many
   failed candidates, e.g. Donald Trump, his is trying so-o-o hard to be
   relevant. It's maybe poetic justice that his audience seems to be
   shrinking and shrinking. I, for one, scarcely care a fig what his
   opinion on anything is.

   The GoP has a fetish for voting to dismantle the ACA in the House.

   There are other things they should be focusing on, but in actuality
   they're just doing it to raise money from the insurance industry and
   big employers like Walmart and McDonalds.

   What I DO CARE about is an annual 20% increase in health care coverage.

   Why the fµking 20% increase, if we are in this culture of individual
   responsibility????

   20 freaking percent!!!!
