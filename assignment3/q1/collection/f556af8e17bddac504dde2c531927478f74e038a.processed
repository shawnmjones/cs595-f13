My Appearance on Rachel Maddow Talking About Fixing Our Election System

   Posted on [10]November 7, 2012 10:38 pm by [11]Rick Hasen

   You can now [12]watch it here.

   A number of viewers wrote to me to praise Washington/Oregon all
   vote-by-mail elections.Â  I don't think this is a good system for the
   entire country, for a number of reasons, beginning with a broader
   potential for election fraud with absentee ballots as well as my lack
   of confidence that election officials in other states could run such a
   system fairly, inclusively and effectively.
