   President Obama presents a copy of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of
   2009 and a copy of the remarks he made during the signing ceremony at
   the Women's Rights National Historical Park Visitors Center in Seneca
   Falls, N.Y., on Aug. 22. (Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images)

   SYRACUSE, N.Y. ‚ It was one of the most memorable lines of President
   Obama‚s [340]second inaugural address, a nod to ‚our forebears through
   Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.‚

   On Thursday, as he took his college affordability bus tour across
   upstate New York, the president paid a visit to Seneca Falls, N.Y.,
   site of a landmark 1848 women‚s rights convention.

   Obama visited the Women‚s Rights National Historical Park Visitors
   Center to celebrate the gains women have made in this country ahead of
   [341]Women‚s Equality Day next Monday.

   At the visitors center, Obama greeted people waiting near bronze
   statues of the likenesses of Elizabeth Coy Stanton, Frederick Douglass,
   Martha Coffin Wright and Thomas and Mary Ann M‚Clintock. ‚This is a
   really lifelike display,‚ Obama joked.

   Obama told the assembled people that he was visiting Seneca Falls
   because ‚we want to make a little contribution.‚

   ‚Please!‚ one woman responded. ‚We‚ll take it.‚

   Obama presented the visitors center with a copy of the Lilly Ledbetter
   Fair Pay Act of 2009, the first bill he signed into law. Obama also
   presented a copy of the remarks he delivered at the signing ceremony

   Written on the signed copy of his speech text was: ‚It's an honor to
   visit Seneca Falls and recall the righteous struggle that found
   expression here. I'm also proud to add an example of Lilly Ledbetter's
   leadership to your collection. Thanks for all you do to honor the
   character and perseverance of America's women."
