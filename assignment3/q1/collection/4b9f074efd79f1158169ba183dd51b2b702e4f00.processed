   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [47]Tagging tips - [48]Search For Tags - [49]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       It's Fox News: "We Squirrel. You Go Nuts."
       Also view its corporate journalmalistic partners: CBS, NBC, ABC,
       MSNBC, etc.
       (Pay no attention to Democracy Now, Link TV, McClatchy DC Bureau,
       etc. They not nearly squirrelly enough for mature Villager news
       consumers. Always follow David Gregory's lead.)

   I generally avoid the corporate news programs for the same reasons
   everyone here does, but I worry that I may be spending too much time in
   a progressive echo chamber.

   I just want a non-sensational journalism source that reports in a
   level-headed matter on Stuff That's Important and leaves the
   sensational ratings-bait for the corporate talking heads.  Any
   suggestions?

 Don't forget "The Real News" and Al Jazeera ([263]0+ / 0-)
       No news source is going to be completely free from skew or
       filtering-- which is not the same as the kind of wilful dishonesty
       one sees on, e.g. FNC or other anti-democratic entities' pet
       broadcasters-- but the more you look at, the better chance you have
       of hearing of significant events.
       I should note that Qatar is not a democracy and has [264]a page on
       Amnesty International's site like many (most?) other countries
       However, the state seems to allow Al J significant independence.
       RT is Russia Today, and Russia is a "[265]Managed Democracy". Putin
       won with the slogan "[266]There is no alternative to Putin" but
       also, I understand, by the creation of fake opposition parties that
       split the vote. The station seems to have a libertarian/contrarian
       position chosen to undermine the official line on official enemies
       of the US. Of course, sometimes (often?) this position is correct.

   Seriously though, I think one might well suppose that with Snowden
   having been in both China and Russia, any information on his laptop has
   already been copied and compromised, even without his consent.

   When the Pentagon Papers issue was heating up in the spring of 1971, my
   fraternity house at Cornell had a visit from two FBI agents.
   Unbeknownst to us, Daniel Ellsberg had been a member of said fraternity
   in the previous decade. They figured we'd know where he was, being
   fraternity brothers and all.

   Well, no. We were not exactly the most traditional fraternity on campus
   and we particularly had no tradition of keeping in touch with alums. It
   didn't help that I and my two friends were, um, high at the time. But
   we finally convinced them that really we would liked to have helped
   them (not really true) and that we DIDN'T know anything (absolutely
   true), and they went away.

   I figured that well, Nixon. Apparently, this is something else we can't
   blame him for entirely.

       I'm not suggesting Obama is a traitor.
       He was never on the 99% side to begin with.
       And yes - in 2008 - I thought he was.  One thing I can thank Obama
       for:  He has provided an avalanche of transparency regarding the
       (D) vs. (R) wrestling match put on at the Kabuki Theater of the
       Absurd.
       Until Obama, I couldn't see through the games being played.  Now I
       can.  And I don't know how I ever fell for it.
       The excuses for Obama's behavior have long since passed the point
       of predictability neccessary to qualify as an absurd production of
       Kabuki Theater.

   I trust our guys (Democrats) slightly more than I trust those other

   I suppose every government with the capability of NSA-level "spying" is
   engaged in it.

   Those who don't have that massive capability do what they can with
   less.

   Layers of oversight and "transparency" will result from this latest

   For instance, the notion that he's a spy for the Russians or the

 Also, your comment ([681]0+ / 0-)

   reminded me that I have just as much right to be here as anyone
   else.... including you.  So maybe I just have to come here often and be
   ready to disagree with Tom Tomorrow, and not apologize for it.  So
   basically, your comment had the opposite effect of what you intended;
   instead of discouraging me, as you wanted to, I'm going to come here
   more often in the near future, and be more vocal.  Thanks very much!

 You haven't "disagreed" ([689]0+ / 0-)
       with TT.  You posted a content-free emotional outburst stating that
       you were "so very sick and tired" of TT and TMW.  When Aspe4
       [690]asked you why, which was a perfectly reasonable response to
       your comment, you first took obvious offense at even being asked
       the question, stating that you don't owe an explanation, which
       itself is hilarious -- you apparently expect your emotional
       outbursts to be accepted at face value, without any substantiation
       or explanation on your part, and without being questioned by anyone
       else.  I'm not sure what makes you think you have some kind of
       special right not to be questioned, but that kind of petulance and
       belligerence on your part doesn't help you one bit.
       Then, in lieu of an actual explanation containing, you know, facts,
       reasoning and evidence, you made vague assertions about how you
       "find" TT to be "condescending" and "elitist" -- without ever
       stating the reasons or providing examples of why this is so.  I
       note with interest that this is a charge that was regularly leveled
       by rightwingers against a certain Democratic Presidential candidate
       in 2008, and for the same reason you are doing it -- because they
       lacked anything of substance with which to oppose or argue with
       him.
       And then you started in with your GBCW bullshit about how you were
       going to visit DKos less in the future, apparently because it
       doesn't conform to your personal standards and demands.  As I noted
       above, feel free not to visit if that's how you feel.
       You have every right to be here and every right to disagree with TT
       and TMW. You have no right, however, to expect your "disagreements"
       to go unquestioned by others, especially when they are as
       substance-free as this one was.   And when you post bullshit, you
       can expect to have people call bullshit on you.   That's how it
       works.  If you don't like it, the door's right over there.

 Incredibly Funny Cartoon...... ([742]0+ / 0-)

   That is if it had been created around 2006. It was at that time when GW
   Bush signed the Patriot Act, he decided the only Americans who would
   get to see the "spy activity" were those in the Intelligence Committee.
    One can only imagine the shenanigans that went on (I'm sure they know
   my underwear size).

   However Obama expanded it to where every member of Congress oversees
   it, the NSA,  The Justice Dept. and more checks and balances than
   you'll ever imagine..in fact it is now the most monitored transparent
   program in our govt; and is re-assessed every 3 months in front of all
   those committees.

   Both GOP and Democrats thus far agree with it. So if you voted, you
   voted for it.  It was probably America's biggest compromise on our
   liberties, but its been worth it.  We still have the NYSE and NY Subway
   System. Terrorists had all their ducks in a row to take both out
   (that's about 10,000 human lives) or more.  If your algorhythms are
   worth more than these human lives, I feel so sad for you, I can't even
   write the feelings here.  Prism actually stopped those and about 98
   lesser but just as deadly attacks.

   Had this cartoon come out from 2006-2007, I'd laugh my a$$ off.  I love
   Tom's work  (usually) but thought he was smarter than this.

   This is more of a "real news story" than a parody or satire.  The real
   story is, "Who is this Edward Snowden" who decided to report a legal
   program on which we all agree to the enemy (and the logistics of it)?

   Had this been an illegal activity (like say Watergate), Snowden, like
   Daniel Ellsberg would be a true hero.  Instead he is a two bit
   opportunist looking for fame, money (and now a home).

   And by the way, I'm a leftie all the way, can't stand Fox News, think
   Obama is the best President in my lifetime...but get this....I still
   love America and understand flexibility and compromise to help make it
   work.  Snowden doesn't.

 Really? ([745]0+ / 0-)

     That is if it had been created around 2006. It was at that time when
     GW Bush signed the Patriot Act,
       Um... the USA PATRIOT (aka Uniting (and) Strengthening America (by)
       Providing Appropriate Tools Required (to) Intercept (and) Obstruct
       Terrorism Act) (yes, that's its actual name) was signed in 2001.

     However Obama expanded it to where every member of Congress oversees
     it
       Really?  Every member?  All 435 members of the House, or all 535
       members of the House and Senate?  Pray explain how that happens,
       and what that "oversight"  actually consists of, without
       unsubstantiated conclusory assertions if you can manage it (which I
       actually doubt).  Bonus if you can do it w/o parroting WH talking
       points.

     the NSA,  The Justice Dept. and more checks and balances than you'll
     ever imagine..
       Please describe specifically what those checks and balances are.
       If you can't, then rest assured your unsubstantiated claim will be
       regarded as exactly that, and not taken seriously.

     in fact it is now the most monitored transparent program in our
     govt;
       That's yours to prove, not ours to take your word for it.  Sorry.
       It sort of doesn't pass the laugh test, though.

     Both GOP and Democrats thus far agree with it.
       Really?  Senator Mark Udall (D-CO) agrees with it?  Senator Jeff
       Merkley (D-OR) agrees with it?  Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) agrees
       with it?  Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) agrees with it?  Rep. Hank
       Johnson (D-GA) agrees with it?
       Riiight.  You might want to [746]read this article if you believe
       that hooey.

     Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., a member of the House Foreign Affairs
     Committee, said there "obviously" needs to be more congressional
     oversight on the telephone surveillance program, under which
     so-called metadata from cellphone records are surrendered to the FBI
     and the NSA on a daily basis.

     "I did not know a billion records a day were coming under control of
     the executive branch," Sherman said.
     Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said that several lawmakers were skeptical
     about what they were being told about the surveillance programs and
     the information being collected.
       Yeah, that totally sounds like they're all in agreement about it.

     The House briefing came hours after eight U.S. senators - six
     Democrats and two Republicans - introduced legislation that would
     require the U.S. attorney general to make public secret decisions of
     the court that grants permission for collection of such records.
       Yep, those 6 D's and 4 R's sure sound like they're right behind the
       program.

     "Americans deserve to know how much information about their private
     communications the government believes it's allowed to take under
     the law," Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said in a statement. "There is
     plenty of room to have this debate without compromising our
     surveillance sources or methods or tipping our hand to our enemies.
     We can't have a serious debate about how much surveillance of
     Americans' communications should be permitted without ending secret
     law."

     Joining him in his effort were Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Patrick
     Leahy, D-Vt., Dean Heller, R-Nev., Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Al
     Franken, D-Minn., Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
     "Alaskans highly value their privacy and their right to privacy,"
     Begich said. "Our Alaska constitution specifically protects this
     right from being trampled on while ensuring national security
     information isn't at risk."
       In other words, you lie.
       You might also try reading [747]this one.

     Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), senior Democrat on the Oversight and
     Government Reform Committee, has been critical of Obama's
     surveillance programs, saying over the weekend that the
     administration has "gone too far" in eroding privacy rights.

     Asked after Tuesday's briefing if he still has those concerns,
     Cummings said simply, "Yes."
     "Most of the members that spoke seemed to be pretty concerned," he
     added.
       And:

     Intelligence Committee leaders have said that lawmakers had access
     to the classified information had they requested briefings. But
     [Rep. Brad] Sherman argued that the nature and scope of the program
     was essentially hidden, even if it was available.

     "If somewhere on page 9,412 was the disclosure of this program, it
     was well concealed under the other 9,000 pages," Sherman said.
       It's unsurprising, btw, that these brave folks are in the minority.
        The fact that most members of Congress, in both parties, are
       firmly in the pocket of the national security surveillance state is
       hardly news.  That doesn't mean, however, given the choices with
       which our system presents us, that those of us who voted voted for
       it.
       The remainder of your comment  -- including your unsubstantiated
       fantasies about mythical terrorist attacks deserves about as much
       credit as the parts I've reproduced, and refuted, above.  Which is
       to say, zero.
       Ben Franklin's quote from over 200 years ago:

     Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little
     Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.
       rings as true today as it did then.  So does the Madison quote in
       my sig.  You're willing to flush those liberties down the toilet.
       "A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not
       long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defence agst.
       foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at
       home." - James Madison
