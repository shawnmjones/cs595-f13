[22]Ohio Board of Education president totally not comparing Obama to Hitler,
she says

   Gun with trigger at center of image.
   We need more guns around because if you think otherwise, you're kinda
   like Hitler. That seems to be the message the gun fetishist crowd has
   coalesced around, [29]because logic is for suckers:

     [Ohio] State Board of Education President Debe Terhar said she was
     not comparing President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler when she posted
     a photograph of the Nazi leader on her Facebook page with a message
     critical of the administration's new gun-control efforts.  [...]

     Terhar, a Cincinnati Republican elected last week by the 19-member
     school board to a second term as its president, recently posted the
     picture with this commentary: "Never forget what this tyrant said:
     `To conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens.' -- Adolf Hitler."

   Fear not, though, because Terhar says she didn't mean it like that:

     "I'm not comparing the president to Adolf Hitler," she said. "It's
     the thought of disarming citizens, and this has happened throughout
     history. What's the true intention of the Second Amendment? It was
     to protect us from a tyrannical government, God forbid."

   See there? It's not that Obama is like Hitler for not wanting more guns
   in schools, it's just that that's like something a tyrannical dictator
   would do, right before gassing people or right after invading Poland.
   (Hitler was also against drinking lead paint straight from the can,
   which is why all true patriot meetups start with chugging a glass of
   whatever-someone-found-in-their-garage-that-week.)

   The Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings have left the gun fetishist
   crowd absolutely befuddled. Their identity revolves around protecting
   themselves from imaginary future tyranny; the best argument they can
   muster as to why your kids and mine have to be continually exposed to
   batshit crazy people with personal arsenals is that we need those
   batshit crazy people with arsenals around, because non-batshit crazy
   people just aren't attuned enough to all the damn tyranny that's coming
   out of the woodwork, and haven't probably honed themselves as
   anti-tyranny killing machines.

   Have you noticed? Almost every one of the most avid gun fetishists out
   there, the people appearing on teevee to yell at the hosts about
   freedom and the like, all argue that they need absolutely unfettered
   gun freedom because they may at some point need to start shooting at
   our government. All our efforts at basic public safety are running
   afoul of a very small, obsessively paranoid crowd whose rationale is
   that we need to enable widespread mass murder, just in case it comes in
   handy someday. You know ... if they ever feel like it.

   These are the people who really need their guns taken away. Not even a
   close question.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [48]Civil
   Rights, [49]Community, [50]Congress, [51]Culture, [52]Economy,
   [53]Education, [54]Elections, [55]Energy, [56]Environment, [57]Health

   [63]National Security, [64]Science, [65]Transportation, or [66]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([67]California, [68]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       A possibly real quote:

     The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow
     the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors
     who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared
     their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say
     that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the
     overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia
     or native police.
       Note this

     History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject
     races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing
       Which says that you take the people's arms AFTER you conquer them.
       This is what every occupier does, including America. So unless
       wingnuts want to compare the US Army to the SS because it takes
       guns in occupied countries, that doesn't make any sense at all.
       However, I have to say that this quote does not sound like Hitler
       either.

 Hitler actually loosened gun restrictions in 1938 ([207]7+ / 0-)

   The 1938 German Weapons Act

     The 1938 German Weapons Act, the precursor of the current weapons
     law, superseded the 1928 law. As under the 1928 law, citizens were
     required to have a permit to carry a firearm and a separate permit
     to acquire a firearm. Furthermore, the law restricted ownership of
     firearms to "...persons whose trustworthiness is not in question and
     who can show a need for a (gun) permit." But under the new law:

         Gun restriction laws applied only to handguns, not to long guns
     or ammunition. The 1938 revisions completely deregulated the
     acquisition and transfer of rifles and shotguns, as was the
     possession of ammunition."[4]
         The legal age at which guns could be purchased was lowered from
     20 to 18.[5]
         Permits were valid for three years, rather than one year.[5]
         The groups of people who were exempt from the acquisition permit
     requirement expanded. Holders of annual hunting permits, government
     workers, and NSDAP members were no longer subject to gun ownership
     restrictions. Prior to the 1938 law, only officials of the central
     government, the states, and employees of the German Reichsbahn
     Railways were exempted.[4]
         Jews were forbidden from the manufacturing or dealing of
     firearms and ammunition.[4]

     .....begins with an account of post-World War I chaos, which led to
     the enactment in 1928 by the liberal Weimar republic of Germany's
     first comprehensive gun control law.

     In 1928, the German government enacted the Law on Firearms and
     Ammunition. This law relaxed gun restrictions and put into effect a
     strict firearm licensing scheme. Under this scheme, Germans could
     possess firearms, but they were required to have separate permits to
     do the following: own or sell firearms, carry firearms (including
     handguns), manufacture firearms, and professionally deal in firearms
     and ammunition. This law explicitly revoked the 1919 Regulations on
     Weapons Ownership, which had banned all firearms possession.

     [232]Stephen Halbrook writes about the German gun restriction laws
     in the 1919-1928 period, "Within a decade, Germany had gone from a
     brutal firearms seizure policy which, in times of unrest, entailed
     selective yet immediate execution for mere possession of a firearm,
     to a modern, comprehensive gun control law."

     Next, the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 was consolidated by massive
     searches and seizures of firearms from political opponents, who were
     invariably described as "communists."
     After five years of repression and eradication of dissidents, Hitler
     signed a new gun control law in 1938, which benefitted Nazi party
     members and entities, but denied firearm ownership to enemies of the
     state. Later that year, in Kristallnacht (the Night of the Broken
     Glass), in one fell swoop, the Nazi regime disarmed Germany's Jews.
     Without any ability to defend themselves, the Jewish population
     could easily be sent to concentration camps for the Final Solution.
     After World War II began, Nazi authorities continued to register and
     mistrust civilian firearm owners, and German resistence to the Nazi
     regime was unsuccessful.

     the people appearing on teevee to yell at the hosts about freedom

     All our efforts at basic public safety are running afoul of a very
     small, obsessively paranoid crowd
       In regards to the last statement, I am sure that similar public
       safety arguments were made in the Germany during the 20's and 30's
       with the passing of their restrictions.
       This country has a legal and judicial system based upon the idea
       that nobody's rights get curtained unless due process has been
       served by a court system and ruled upon by a jury of civilians.
       Some of the comments in this diary would seem to advocate denying
       rights based upon the idea that one vehemently disagrees with
       someone else or finds their position scary.  This is not a
       sufficient metric or reason.  Many people in several of the threads
       like this one have also condoned disarming and limiting the
       capability of common people to resist the civilian police, which is
       a very different subject from the idea that some individual will
       stand against an onslaught from the army.  Unfortunately, this very
       thing is happening right now, in an area that some consider to be
       ideal model for the nation.

       With people crying out for the govt to do something to make them
       safe and solve their problems, some of these people might be all
       too happy to oblige.
       Unlike the far wacky right, I see that govt has a role to play and
       does somethings better than private industry.  Quite frankly, I
       fear what private companies would do more than the govt.  Yet,
       there is still the matter of personal responsibility and if there
       weren't some truth the the exaggerations made by the right  they
       wouldn't be making them.  In my opinion, neither the far right, nor
       the far left are desirable states.   Nazism is an example of the
       far left going askew.  Fascism would be the right going askew.  Our
       constitution and adherence to it, for all it's faults, does a
       pretty damn good job of keeping us walking a middle path.

 Also German Revolution 1918, Beer Hall Putsch 1923 ([253]0+ / 0-)

   There were various political groups struggling to take over Germany
   after ww1.

   In addition to obeying the Treaty of Versailles, there was serious
   insurrection after the war.

   Hitler appealed to the disgruntled vets and the Junkers (conservative
   hereditary office class) with his "stabbed in the back" theory that the
   liberals had caused Germany to lose ww1.

   Hitlers other complaints were the trade unions and the "pan-German"
   problem.  Basically Hitler was taking a "states rights" approach to
   what had formerly been independent German kingdoms, at least until he
   got control and abolished those local governments.  He ridiculed the
   idea of a constitutional government and elections.  Deja vu anyone?

     1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a
     firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm
     for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the
     home.Pp. 2-53.

     2. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.
     It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any
     manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed
     weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment
     or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast
     doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by
     felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of
     firearms
     in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or
     laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale
     of
     arms. Miller's holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those
     "in common use at the time" finds support in the historical
     tradition
     of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.

       The holding in Heller is quite straightforward: the Court ordered
       DC to issue a permit to Dick Heller, assuming he was otherwise
       qualified, to keep a handgun in his home for self-defense purposes.
       That's it.  The Second Amendment guarantees the right to have a
       single firearm in your home, subject to whatever regulations the
       federal, state, and local governments have enacted.  The
       regulations cannot ban such ownership outright, nor be so onerous
       as to be a ban in practice.
       The limitations that have been imposed by various levels of
       government are many and varied, and deal with who can own a weapon,
       what kinds of weapons they can own, where they can possess weapons,
       when they can possess weapons, how they must store weapons, and on
       and on.
       As I said, not even close to limitless.

   G2geek has argued this aspect of crisis control many times. I have used
   running a cardiac code in the same way - with the reality that there is
   only one dead person, rarely any blood, and no one firing at the people
   trying to revive the person.

   Even the cops get the monster adrenalin rush and have to deal with it.
   No matter how frequently they practice. One of the officers involved in
   the ABC experiment cites it as a 'perishable skill'. The half life is

   can jump to thoughtless competence. Only in their fantasies.

 What makes them think a 2030 gun confiscation ([834]0+ / 0-)

   program could be deflected with 1930 resistance.

   True, maybe hitler found gun registration handy in 1930.  But today
   there are many other ways to find guns, and hitler didn't have any
   drones to go get them.  All gun owners are tagged, registration or no
   registration for a 2030 style confiscation.

   Taking responsibility for certain gun serial numbers in your possession
   does not make you vulnerable to modern confiscation techniques.  If
   there is a modern confiscation, looking at files in the clerks office
   probably wouldn't be an issue.

       they repeat it so many times and always switch to something new.
       Any time they are found out.
       It's exhausting.
       Now in a diary the 1999 California confiscation of the SKS is being
       used.
       All I could find in the frothing was that an amnesty registration
       for SKS was offered and then rescinded.  I don't think one gun was
       confiscated.  But with all the frothy fear it is hard to tell.

     NAZIS HUNT ARMS IN EINSTEIN HOME
     Only a Bread Knife Rewards Brown Shirts'
     Search for Alleged Huge Cache
     OUSTING OF JEWS GOES ON . . . .
     BERLIN, March 20 (1933 NYTimes). - Charging that Professor Albert
     Einstein had a huge quantity of arms and ammunition stored in his
     secluded home in Caputh, the National Socialists sent Brown Shirt
     men and policemen to search it today, but the nearest thing to arms
     they found was a bread knife. Professor Einstein's home, which for
     the present is empty, the professor being on his way back to Europe
     from the United States, was surrounded on all sides and one of the
     most perfect raids of recent German history was carried out. The
     outcome was a disappointment to those who have always regarded
     Professor Einstein's pacifist utterances as a mere pose.

   She meant it like Jon Mackey comparing Obamacare to fascism.

   In other words, she meant the original dictionary definition of "Nazi"
   (like from the 1800's?), before it came to mean Hitler and death camps
   and all that stuff.

   We progressives can be so literal-minded sometimes.  Of course she
   wasn't thinking of Hitler when she said Nazi.  She was talking about
   nazism the way Adam Smith and The Founding Fathers understood the
   principle.  She was taking a deeper, more mature and historically
   informed view honoring original intent, etc. -- exactly the kind of
   thing that goes right over Progressives' heads.

   Any reasonable conservative would understand that.
