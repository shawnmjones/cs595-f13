The "Public Safety" Exception to Miranda

   The "Public Safety" Exception to Miranda

   By CARL A. BENOIT, J.D.

                         police officers at a scene

   After 44 years, the Miranda decision stands as a monolith in police
   procedure.^1 Its requirements are so well known that the Supreme Court
   remarked, "Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to
   the point where the warnings have become part of our national
   culture."^2 And, although the Supreme Court has clarified and refined
   Miranda over the years, its central requirements are clear.^3 Whenever
   the prosecution seeks in its direct case to introduce a statement made
   by a suspect while in custody and in response to interrogation, it must
   prove that the subject was warned of specific rights and voluntarily
   waived those rights.^4 The penalty imposed on the prosecution for
   failing to prove that the Miranda procedures were properly followed is
   harsh. While some secondary and limited uses of statements obtained in
   violation of Miranda are permitted, such statements are presumed to be
   coerced and cannot be introduced by the prosecution in its direct
   case.^5

   The strength of the Miranda decision is its clarity in its nearly
   unwavering protection of a suspect's Fifth Amendment protection against
   selfincrimination. The commitment to this rule is so strong that the
   Supreme Court has recognized only one exception to the Miranda
   rule--the "public safety" exception--which permits law enforcement to
   engage in a limited and focused unwarned interrogation and allows the
   government to introduce the statement as direct evidence.

   Recent and well-publicized events, including the attempted bombing of
   Northwest Airlines Flight 235 near Detroit, Michigan, on December 25,
   2009, and the attempted bombing in New York City's Times Square in May
   2010, highlight the importance of this exception.^6 Those current
   events, occurring in a time of heightened vigilance against terrorist
   acts, place a spotlight on this law enforcement tool, which, although
   26 years old, may play a vital role in protecting public safety while
   also permitting statements obtained under this exception to be used as
   evidence in a criminal prosecution. In brief, and as discussed in this
   article, police officers confronting situations that create a danger to
   themselves or others may ask questions designed to neutralize the
   threat without first providing a warning of rights. This article
   discusses the origins of the public safety exception and provides
   guidance for law enforcement officers confronted with an emergency that
   may require interrogating a suspect held in custody about an imminent
   threat to public safety without providing Miranda warnings.

   ORIGIN OF THE RULE

   The origin of the public safety exception to Miranda, the case of New
   York v. Quarles, began in the early morning hours of September 11,
   1980. While on routine patrol in Queens, New York, two New York City
   police officers were approached by a young woman who told them that she
   had just been raped. She described the assailant as a black male,
   approximately 6 feet tall, wearing a leather jacket with "Big Ben"
   printed in yellow letters on the back. The woman told the officers that
   the man had just entered a nearby supermarket and that he was carrying
   a gun.

   The officers drove to the supermarket, and one entered the store while
   the other radioed for assistance. A man matching the description was
   near a checkout counter, but upon seeing the officer, ran to the back
   of the store. The officer pursued the subject, but lost sight of him
   for several seconds as the individual turned a corner at the end of an
   aisle. Upon finding the subject, the officer ordered him to stop and to
   put his hands over his head. As backup personnel arrived, the officer
   frisked the man and discovered he was wearing an empty shoulder
   holster. After handcuffing him, the officer asked where the gun was.
   The man gestured toward empty milk cartons and said, "The gun is over
   there." The officer found and removed a loaded handgun from a carton,
   formally placed the man under arrest, and then read the Miranda rights
   to him. The man waived his rights and answered questions about the
   ownership of the gun and where it was purchased.^7

   The state of New York charged the man, identified as Benjamin Quarles,
   for criminal possession of a weapon.^8 The trial court excluded the
   statement "The gun is over there," as well as the handgun, on the
   grounds that the officer did not give Quarles the warnings required by
   Miranda v. Arizona. ^9 After an appellate court affirmed the decision,
   the case was appealed to the New York State Court of Appeals.

   The New York Court of Appeals upheld the trial court decision by a 4 to
   3 vote.^10 According to the New York Court of Appeals, because Quarles
   responded "to the police interrogation while he was in custody, [and]
   before he had been given the preinterrogation warnings...," the lower
   courts properly suppressed the statement and the gun.^11 The court
   refused to recognize an emergency exception to Miranda and noted that
   even if there were such an exception, there was "no evidence in the
   record before us that there were exigent circumstances posing a risk to
   the public safety or that the police interrogation was prompted by such
   concern."^12 In dissent, Judge Watchler believed that there was a
   public safety exception to Miranda and that the facts presented such a
   situation. Judge Watchler noted that "Miranda was never intended to
   enable a criminal defendant to thwart official attempts to protect the
   general public against an imminent, immediate and grave risk of serious
   physical harm reasonably perceived."^13 He also believed there was "a
   very real threat of possible physical harm which could result from a
   weapon being at large."^14 The state of New York appealed the case to
   the Supreme Court.

   The Quarles case provides a framework that police officers can use to
   assess a particular situation, determine whether the exception is
   available, and ensure that their questioning remains within the scope
   of the rule. The Supreme Court ruled on these facts that a public
   safety exception to Miranda existed. To understand how the Court
   reached this conclusion and the implications of this exception on the
   admissibility of the statement and the handgun, a consideration of a
   summary of the steps used by the Court is important.

   The first step toward this conclusion was a discussion by the Court of
   the relationship between the Miranda requirements and the Fifth
   Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Fifth Amendment provides that
   "[n]o person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
   against himself."^15 The Fifth Amendment "does not prohibit all
   incriminating admissions," only those that are "officially coerced
   selfaccusations...." ^16 In Miranda, the Supreme Court "for the first
   time extended the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory
   self-incrimination to individuals subjected to custodial interrogation
   by the police."^17 Thus, Miranda created a presumption that
   "interrogation in custodial circumstances is inherently coercive" and
   that statements obtained under those circumstances "are inadmissible
   unless the subject is specifically informed of his Miranda rights and
   freely decides to forgo those rights."^18 Importantly, the Court noted
   that Miranda warnings were not required by the Constitution, but were
   prophylactic measures designed to provide protection for the Fifth
   Amendment privilege against selfincrimination. ^19

   After providing this explanation of the relationship between the Fifth
   Amendment and Miranda, the Court explained that Quarles did not claim
   that his statements were "actually compelled by police conduct which
   overcame his will to resist."^20 Had police officers obtained an
   involuntary or coerced statement from Quarles in violation of the due
   process clause of the Fifth Amendment, both the statement and the
   handgun would have been suppressed. ^21 And, in this regard, the Court
   explained that the failure to administer Miranda warnings does not,
   standing alone, make a confession involuntary in violation of the
   Constitution. ^22

   person being placed under arrest The Supreme Court then proceeded to
   determine whether the Miranda rule was implicated in this case and
   agreed with the New York Court of Appeals that it was. The Court agreed
   with the New York courts that Quarles was in custody. As the Court
   noted, "Quarles was surrounded by at least four police officers and was
   handcuffed when the questioning at issue took place."^23 Therefore, on
   the facts of the case, the Court found that the Miranda decision was
   clearly implicated. The Court then referred to the determination by the
   New York courts that there was nothing in the record indicating that
   any of the police officers were concerned with their safety when they
   questioned Quarles. The Supreme Court noted that the New York Court of
   Appeals did not address the issue of whether there was an exception to
   Miranda in cases that involve a danger to the public "because the lower
   courts in New York made no factual determination that the police had
   acted with that motive."^24

   The Supreme Court chose to address whether a public safety exception to
   Miranda should exist. In this regard, the Court held that: "there is a
   'public safety' exception to the requirement that Miranda warnings be
   given before a suspect's answers may be admitted into evidence, and the
   exception does not depend upon the motivation of the individual
   officers involved."^25 Thus, according to the Court, without regard to
   the actual motivation of the individual officers, Miranda need not be
   strictly followed in situations "in which police officers ask questions
   reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety."^26

   The Court then applied the facts to the situation confronting them when
   Quarles was arrested. In the course of arresting Quarles, it became
   apparent that Quarles had removed the handgun and discarded it within
   the store. While the location of the handgun remained undetermined, it
   posed a danger to public safety.^27 In this case, the officer needed an
   answer to the question about the location of the gun to ensure that its
   concealment in a public location would not endanger the public. The
   immediate questioning of Quarles was directed specifically at resolving
   this emergency. Since the questioning of Quarles was prompted by
   concern for public safety, the officers were not required to provide
   Miranda warnings to Quarles first. Therefore, the statement made by
   Quarles about the location of the handgun was admissible.^28 In
   addition, because the Court found there was no violation of Miranda,
   the handgun also was admissible. The Court declined to address whether
   the handgun would have been suppressed if the statements were found to
   be inadmissible.^29

   FRAMEWORK OF THE EXCEPTION

   The Quarles case provides a framework that police officers can use to
   assess a particular situation, determine whether the exception is
   available, and ensure that their questioning remains within the scope
   of the rule. This framework includes the presence of a public safety
   concern, limited questioning, and voluntariness.

   Public Safety Concern

   According to the Supreme Court, the public safety exception is
   triggered when police officers have an objectively reasonable need to
   protect the police or the public from immediate danger. Because the
   standard is objective, the availability of the exception does not
   depend on subjective motivation of the officers. Legitimate concerns
   for officer safety or public safety prompting unwarned custodial
   questioning arise in a variety of contexts. A common factor that can be
   gleaned from the courts addressing this issue is the prior knowledge or
   awareness of specific facts or circumstances that give rise to the
   imminent safety concern that prompted the questioning.

   ...the public safety exception is triggered when police officers have
   an objectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public from
   immediate danger. For example, in U.S. v. Talley, police officers
   executing a federal arrest warrant at a residence heard sounds
   indicating that a number of unexpected people were inside the home.^30
   The officers returned to their vehicles to get their bulletproof vests
   and then returned to the front door. After the defendant and another
   individual were secured by a police officer just inside the residence,
   the officer noticed other people inside the house who had not complied
   with the demand to come outside. The officer entered further into the
   residence to gain control of the unsecured subjects and tripped over a
   trash can that contained bullets and a magazine for a semiautomatic
   pistol. The officer returned to the two subjects and asked, "Where is
   the gun?" The defendant told the officer that the gun was inside a
   vacuum cleaner, from where it was retrieved. The defendant sought to
   suppress the gun, claiming the officer did not provide him his Miranda
   warnings first. The district court suppressed the defendant's
   statement, finding a violation of Miranda. The circuit court reversed
   and upheld the admissibility of the statement. The court stressed the
   context of the arrest in finding that the public safety exception was
   applicable. The court stated that "[o]nce Officer Rush had seen the
   magazine, he had reason to believe a gun was nearby and was justified,
   under Quarles, in asking his question prior to administering a Miranda
   warning."^31

   In U.S. v. Jones, members of a fugitive task force arrested Phillip
   Jones for a homicide he committed with a handgun on June 27, 2006.^32
   Members of the task force met on August 10, 2006, the day of the
   arrest, and were briefed about the nature of the homicide, the
   possibility that Jones may have two weapons, and that he had two
   previous convictions for gun and drug offenses. After going to search
   for Jones in a dangerous high-crime area in northeast Washington, D.C.,
   Deputy U.S. Marshal Cyphers made eye contact with Jones, who
   immediately fled. The marshal pursued and caught Jones in a partially
   lit stairwell of an apartment building. At some point during the chase,
   Cyphers heard a gunshot fired. Within 30 seconds of arresting Jones and
   before providing the Miranda warnings, Cyphers asked if Jones had
   anything on him. Jones replied, "I have a burner in my waistband."^33
   Jones sought to suppress his statement. The circuit court had little
   difficulty in determining that "Cypher's questions fell squarely within
   the public safety exception."^34 The circuit court stressed the
   information that Deputy U.S. Marshal Cyphers knew about Jones before
   making the arrest, as well as the circumstances surrounding the chase
   and arrest, concluding that the question was prompted by a concern for
   public safety.

   In each of the two cases above, information that came to the attention
   of the law enforcement officers concerning an immediate threat to
   safety prompted the officers to ask questions directed at neutralizing
   the danger. In both cases, the reviewing courts agreed with the
   officers that the information prompted a public safety concern.

   person in handcuffs Limited Questioning

   The Quarles Court made clear that only those questions necessary for
   the police "to secure their own safety or the safety of the public"
   were permitted under the public safety exception.^35 In U.S. v. Khalil,
   New York City police officers raided an apartment in Brooklyn after
   they received information that Khalil and Abu Mezer had bombs in their
   apartment and were planning to detonate them.^36 During the raid, both
   men were shot and wounded as one of them grabbed the gun of a police
   officer and the other crawled toward a black bag believed to contain a
   bomb. When the officers looked inside the black bag, they saw pipe
   bombs and observed that a switch on one bomb was flipped.

   Officers went to the hospital to question Abu Mezer about the bombs.
   They asked Abu Mezer "how many bombs there were, how many switches were
   on each bomb, which wires should be cut to disarm the bombs, and
   whether there were any timers."^37 Abu Mezer answered each question and
   also was asked whether he planned to kill himself in the explosion. He
   responded by saying, "Poof."^38

   Abu Mezer sought to suppress each of his statements, but the trial
   court permitted them, ruling that they fell within the public safety
   exception. On appeal, Abu Mezer only challenged the admissibility of
   the last question, whether he intended to kill himself when detonating
   the bombs. He claimed the question was unrelated to public safety. The
   circuit court disagreed and noted "Abu Mezer's vision as to whether or
   not he would survive his attempt to detonate the bomb had the potential
   for shedding light on the bomb's stability."^39

   A common theme throughout cases such as this is the importance of
   limiting the interrogation of a subject to questions directed at
   eliminating the emergency. Following Quarles, at least two federal
   circuit courts of appeals have addressed the issue of the effect of an
   invocation of a right on the exception. In U.S. v. De- Santis, the
   Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the public safety exception
   applies even after the invocation of counsel.^40 According to the
   court: "The same consideration that allows the police to dispense with
   providing Miranda warnings in a public safety situation also would
   permit them to dispense with the prophylactic safeguard that forbids
   initiating further questioning of an accused who requests counsel."^41

   In U.S. v. Mobley, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled that
   the public safety exception applied even when the subject had invoked
   his right to counsel.^42 The court recognized that a threat to public
   safety still may exist even after Miranda rights are provided and
   invoked.

   Once the questions turn from those designed to resolve the concern for
   safety to questions designed solely to elicit incriminating statements,
   the questioning falls...within the traditional rules of Miranda.
   Voluntariness

   Voluntariness is the linchpin of the admissibility of any statement
   obtained as a result of government conduct.^43 Thus, statements
   obtained by the government under the public safety exception cannot be
   coerced or obtained through tactics that violate fundamental notions of
   due process.^44 Here, it is worth mentioning that prior to the Miranda
   decision, the only test used to determine the admissibility of
   statements in federal court was whether the statement was voluntarily
   made within the requirements of the due process clause.^45 This test
   requires that a court review the "totality of the circumstances" to
   determine whether the subject's will was overborne by police conduct.
   If a court finds that the questioning of a subject, even in the
   presence of a situation involving public safety, violated due process
   standards, the statement will be suppressed.^46

   In the Khalil case, Abu Mezer also argued that the statements he made
   to police officers while he was in the hospital should be suppressed
   because they were not voluntary. Testimony from the interviewing agent
   indicated that although Abu Mezer was in pain, "he was alert, seemed to
   understand the questions, and gave responsive answers."^47 Testimony
   from the surgeon indicated that Abu Mezer "was alert and had no
   difficulty understanding her explanation of the surgical procedure he
   would undergo."^48 The district court found that under the totality of
   the circumstances, Abu Mezer's statements were voluntary, and the court
   of appeals upheld this determination.

   Police officers must be vigilant to ensure that the questioning and
   other actions of the police, even if prompted by an emergency situation
   involving public safety, permits subjects to exercise their free will
   when deciding to answer questions. This exception does not permit
   police officers to compel a statement from a subject. It simply permits
   them to question a subject before providing any Miranda warnings to
   resolve an imminent public safety concern.

   CONCLUSION

   The "public safety" exception to Miranda is a powerful tool with a
   modern application for law enforcement. When police officers are
   confronted by a concern for public safety, Miranda warnings need not be
   provided prior to asking questions directed at neutralizing an imminent
   threat, and voluntary statements made in response to such narrowly
   tailored questions can be admitted at trial. Once the questions turn
   from those designed to resolve the concern for safety to questions
   designed solely to elicit incriminating statements, the questioning
   falls outside the scope of the exception and within the traditional
   rules of Miranda.
