[22]Open thread for night owls: The rich are recovering fine, the rest of us
aren't. That's no accident

   Les Leopold writes [29]The Rich Have Gained $5.6 Trillion in the
   'Recovery,' While the Rest of Us Have Lost $669 Billion:

   Oh, are we getting ripped off. And now we've got the data to prove it.
      From 2009 to 2011, the richest 8 million families (the top 7%) on
    average saw their wealth rise from $1.7 million to $2.5 million each.
       Meanwhile the rest of us --  the bottom 93% (that's 111 million
         families) -- suffered on average a decline of $6,000 each.

   Do the math and you'll discover that the top 7% gained a whopping $5.6
   trillion in net worth (assets minus liabilities) while the rest of lost
     $669 billion. Their wealth went up by 28% while ours went down by 4
                                  percent.

    It's as if the entire economic recovery is going into the pockets of
                   the rich. And that's no accident. [...]

              The solutions are simple, but the fight is hard.

                             The Robin Hood Tax

   The best way to move money from Wall Street to Main street is through a
    financial transaction tax -- a small charge on each and every sale of
    stocks, bonds and derivatives of all kinds. Consider it a sin tax on
    Wall Street's many vices. Such a tax could raise enough money so that
    every student in this country could go to a two- or four-year public
   college or university, tuition-free Just think what the elimination of
     increasing student debt would do to the lopsided wealth statistics.
   Just think of what that would do for jobs as colleges expanded to deal
   with the demand. It's not a wild-eyed demand: 11 countries are about to
                adopt such a tax. (See [30]robinhoodtax.org)

                             Public State Banks

   A second critical strategy to end Wall Street as we know it is to form
    50 public state banks on the model of the Bank of North Dakota. These
    would function as real banks rather than the rigged casinos that pass
   for banks on Wall Street. State banks are designed to support community
    banks that, in turn, lend to local businesses. Most importantly, the
    public bankers would be paid reasonable salaries rather than gouging
   themselves at the trough. (See [31]"Why is Socialism doing so darn well
                         in Deep Red North Dakota?")

      The [32]Public Banking Institute is paving the way as its leaders
   (Ellen Brown and Marc Armstrong) help some 20 states explore the idea.
     They need and deserve our support. And for all you Fed haters, they
     also are formulating some very cool ideas about how to dramatically
     transform our central bank. (More on that in a future piece.) Most
   importantly, we all need to find a common way to protest Wall Street's
         rule over the economy and over Washington. This isn't about
         redistributing their wealth. It's about getting ours back.
            _____________________________________________________

   [33]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2008--Fox
   Military Propagandist Promotes Terrorist Murder:

      Does support of terrorists make one a terrorist? Presumably that
   depends on whether you take Mister Bush's squint-eyed November 6, 2001,
      prescription -- "You're either with us or against us in the fight
     against terror" -- in a blindly nationalistic fashion or in a moral
    one. Terrorism isn't an ideology. It's a technique. Much as sophists
     and thugs - such as the late Jeane Kirkpatrick -- like to twist the
   definition to fit who is carrying out a policy, terrorism can't be one
                  thing for them and something else for us.

     Yet one of the most pre-eminent of the Pentagon's chosen propaganda
      team of ex-military-cum-television-analysts, retired Lt. Gen. Tom
   McInerney, not only supports but promotes terrorism against Iran. He's
       still spewing on Fox News despite having been exposed by David
                   Barstow's revelations three weeks ago.'

     This isn't new territory for McInerney. He's argued for attacks on
    Iranfor as long as Bill Kristol and other neoconservatives have done.
     As a member of the Iran Policy Committee, McInerney has long argued
    that the State Department should take the Mujahideen-e Khalq off its
    terrorist watch list. The group originated as leftwing opposition to
      the Shah of Iran in 1963 and was involved in various operations,
    including the taking of U.S. Embassy hostages in 1979 and the bloody
       suppression of the Shiite revolt in Iraq under Saddam Hussein.

    Although MEK killed Americans as well as Iranians in the past, it has
       since adopted a public veneer of being a backer of freedom and
   democracy as soon as the Iranian mullahs are overturned, the idea being
             to install one of its founders as Iran's president.

   commas.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [60]Civil
   Rights, [61]Community, [62]Congress, [63]Culture, [64]Economy,
   [65]Education, [66]Elections, [67]Energy, [68]Environment, [69]Health
   Care, [70]International, [71]Labor, [72]Law, [73]Media, [74]Meta,
   [75]National Security, [76]Science, [77]Transportation, or [78]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([79]California, [80]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 I wish people... ([155]0+ / 0-)
       ...would think carefully before advocating the financial
       transaction tax (aka, the Robin Hood tax).
       We should tax each firm's trading profits, and we should do it at a
       higher rate.
       We should tax the personal income of individuals at a higher rate.
       But taxing transactions does nothing but reduce liquidity and make
       the US financial industry less competitive.
       Please note that the biggest advocates of the Transaction Tax are
       foreigners from countries that don't have a world-class financial
       sector. People come from all over the world to use our financial
       markets. We get to regulate the trades and we get to tax the
       traders. It is a clean-and-green industry that generates no
       pollution other than swear words.
       Don't tax transactions: Tax profits.

     Do we tax a writer every time he finishes a sentence?
     Do we tax a farmer each time he plants a seed?
     Do we tax carpenter each time he cuts a slab of wood?
       No. We tax the income generated by the finished work, when it is
       published, harvested, or sold.
       We need to keep it the same way with finance. If we don't, the
       deals can be moved to Dubai, Hong Kong, or elsewhere. Then we lose
       the jobs, the income, the tax revenue, and (most importantly) the
       regulatory control. Elzabeth Warren has no subpoena power in Dubai!
       Transactions taxes are a bad idea that distracts us from good
       ideas.

       Say I sell 50 shares of company A for $1,000 -- and buy 10 shares
       for company B for $1000.
       How much tax do I pay on these two transactions?
       (I realize whether I have a profit or loss is irrevalent.)
       I bet we all would like to know.

       that people bought and sold stocks through a broker, who charged a
       fee.  A "transaction tax".  Everything worked fine.  Of course that
       was back in the days when "the market" was more a "market" than a
       casino.
       The "big players" were mostly exempted from that, then as now, but
       back then "the market" wasn't run (and gamed) so completely by the
       big players, either.  Now, with computers doing the "programmed
       trading" and pretty much the whole thing rigged and manipulated of,
       by and for the 1%, we need a "transaction tax" to (begin to)
       recapture "the market" as . . . a market.
       A transaction tax of 0.5% (a common broker fee in the old days)
       would do a lot to restore (some) order, and generate some needed
       revenue as well.
       It certainly wouldn't hurt to tax capital gains like regular income
       again, close the "rich man's loopholes" and remove the cap on the
       payroll tax too.  For a start . . .

 Everything was *not* fine. ([171]0+ / 0-)
       Back in those days, only the rich could afford stocks.
       You had to be rich enough to afford the tax and you had to be able
       to hold illiquid assets while you waited for the stock to
       (hopefully) rise enough to cover the broker's fee.
       But your post brings up another big misconception about the
       Transaction Tax:

     "A transaction tax of 0.5% (a common broker fee in the old days)
     would do a lot to restore (some) order..."
       Many people like the TT because they think it will slow down
       high-speed trading, or give incentives for people to be "long-term
       investors". Fine. If you want to outlaw high-speed trading, just
       make it illegal.
       If you want people to hold stocks for years instead of days, just
       mandate that they do so. Put in a punitive tax for early sellers
       (one [172]already exists, actually)
       The SEC can outlaw high-speed trading tomorrow, with no legislation
       required. We don't need this destructive Transaction Tax to do it.

 no, wrong, and ([176]0+ / 0-)
       it is much easier to impose a simple transaction tax and let the
       market itself figure out what is "investing" and what is
       market-manipulating "churn".
       It is hard even to define "high-speed trading" (for purpose of
       regulation) . . . but a 0.5% transaction tax would put a stop to
       whatever it is.  It would have no negative effect on real
       "investing" . . . and half a percent is still nowhere near
       society's "fair share".

   they suddenly started slowing down right when Hurricane Sandy hit.  It

   According to UN investigators, eyewitness testimony indicates that the
   Syrian rebels, rather than Assad's government, were the ones who used
   sarin nerve gas.

     U.N. human rights investigators have gathered testimony from
     casualties of Syria's civil war and medical staff indicating that
     rebel forces have used the nerve agent sarin, one of the lead
     investigators said on Sunday.

     The United Nations independent commission of inquiry on Syria has
     not yet seen evidence of government forces having used chemical
     weapons, which are banned under international law, said commission
     member Carla Del Ponte.

     "Our investigators have been in neighboring countries interviewing
     victims, doctors and field hospitals and, according to their report
     of last week which I have seen, there are strong, concrete
     suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin
     gas, from the way the victims were treated," Del Ponte said in an
     interview with Swiss-Italian television.

     "This was use on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by the
     government authorities," she added, speaking in Italian.

   via [256]TPM.

   I doubt this will have any bearing on what John McCain believes to be
   the right course of action for the US.

   FYI, Carla Del Ponte was the chief UN prosecutor for the International
   Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International
   Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

       but it really doesn't seem outside the realm of possibilities,
       assuming these preliminary findings prove true, that the rebels
       were given the sarin by a foreign government/intelligence agency

   but I watched a video of Christopher Guest's "Waiting for Guffman"
   about 30 times and I realized that comedy was secondary to something
   utterly sweet which happens in many local theatre groups.  May this
   simple pure love of whatever continue.  We could use simple goodness.

   Student elections are upon us at UCLA.  This week, you shall see the
   campus become divided as never it will be during the school year, where
   friendships are tested and sometimes broken, insults get hurled all
   over, ugly savage attacks are waged, backstabbing is frequent, and
   skullduggery of the highest order that would make Obama and Romney
   blush.

   Yes, it's elections for student government at a university.

   This year, the two "slates" (i.e., political parties) are [628]Bruins
   United and [629]Let's Act!.  But this year, there's a third party
   [630]Bruin Alliance that's also running, but only for two out of the 13
   positions.

   I thought this could make for an interesting thought experiment.  Visit
   the two websites, listen to what they have to say, and I'd like to hear
   what Kossacks think about the two slates, and if they prefer one over
   another.  There is no left-right spectrum here; it's... different.

   FYI, a HUGE deal over the years has been club endorsements.  Many clubs
   on campus endorse a slate, but Bruin Democrats [631]endorses
   individually by position.  And this year, Bruin Democrats actually
   endorsed... the chairman of Bruin Republicans to win his race for
   student government, because frankly, he's just a damn good and
   qualified candidate.  (He's also from the sane wing of the GOP, one of
   the few left.  I'll vouch for him too; he's a good guy.)

   So yeah, the left-right spectrum we're accustomed to does not apply
   here.

   Oh, and one of the board members of Bruin Democrats is also working as
   the campaign manager for one of the people running for office.  Despite
   that, the club did NOT endorse that candidate.  BD takes its
   endorsement process very seriously.  Candidates must prove themselves
   to be qualified and worthy of an endorsement.

   And to show how crazy and ugly things can get, here's a video one of
   the slates put out.  It quickly became controversial, and was attacked
   by the other slate.

     By REUTERS

     UN investigator says suspicion is based on testimony taken from
     casualties of Syrian war in neighboring countries.

     [650]http://www.jpost.com/...

     GENEVA - UN human rights investigators have gathered testimony from
     casualties of Syria's civil war and medical staff indicating that
     rebel forces have used the nerve agent sarin, one of the lead
     investigators said on Sunday.

     The United Nations independent commission of inquiry on Syria has
     not yet seen evidence of government forces having used chemical
     weapons, which are banned under international law, said commission
     member Carla Del Ponte.

     United Nations human rights investigators said Sunday they have

     Assad's regime, may have used chemical weapons.

     "Our investigators have been in neighboring countries interviewing
     victims, doctors and field hospitals and, according to their report
     of last week which I have seen, there are strong, concrete
     suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin
     gas, from the way the victims were treated," Carla Del Ponte, a
     member of the independent commission of inquiry on Syria, told
     Swiss-Italian television. "This was use on the part of the
     opposition, the rebels, not by the government authorities."

   making so much while the rest of us aren't, boy will he be mad! I know
   he cares about workers. He made it clear that he was going to work for
   "Main Street".

   "We cannot only have a plan for Wall Street. We must also help Main
   Street." - Sept. 19, 2008

   I know he'll be surprised that Wall St. is doing so well, since he
   called for "tough new regulations on financial institutions".

 There is another approach that might prove useful ([790]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   When financial crises loom, it might be nice if our dear leaders in
   Washington decided that its resolution did not involve throwing
   billions and billions of dollars at the people who caused it while
   declaring the millions of peopl thrown out of work and home to be
   unfortunate collateral damage.

   Oh -- and wait! -- then going on to puruse other "more important"
   issues while telling the poor saps on the sidelines that they really
   need to be more patient.  After all, what are their mere lives,
   livelihoods, families, etc when compared to the chance to make history?

 Open Thread: Iron Man 3: what's up with #23? ([795]0+ / 0-)

   Just saw the movie. I never notice this stuff first time around. There
   was a scene where Pepper was driving a car with the license plate
   "STARK23" then later in the movie there was a cop car with a roof
   number "023". This is usually not an accident. Google is not helping.
   Does anyone know why "23" is significant? #tinfoilhat.

 I won't diary this. But someone should. ([802]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [803]DRo

   [804]THIS should make a splash. I doubt it does though.

   Because,

     The political theater has instead played itself out in two episodes
     in which Obama has appeared impotent, or even indifferent, in the
     face of climate change. Currently, we are in the midst of the drama
     over the proposed Keystone pipeline, which Obama has hinted he will
     approve. nasa scientist James Hansen has proclaimed the pipeline,
     which would carry oil from the Canadian tar sands, "game over" for
     the climate. Most analysts, though, don't support Hansen's
     apocalyptic view. A survey of studies conducted by the Congressional
     Research Service found that the pipeline would increase carbon
     emissions by anywhere from 0.06 percent to 0.3 percent per year.
     (Note that emissions dropped 3.7 percent--twelve times the high-end
     estimate--last year.)

   (emphasis mine)

   Why won't I diary it? It's what I've been saying all along. Not going
   to beat my head against a wall.

   It rubs the loofah on its skin or else it gets the falafel again.

 How about taxing the rich and corporations more ([807]3+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [808]JeffW, [809]Eric Nelson, [810]Calamity Jean

   so they can tax the working class less?

   The elevation of appearance over substance, of celebrity over
   character, of short term gains over lasting achievement displays a
   poverty of ambition. It distracts you from what's truly important. -

 So my math still holds up. ([813]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [814]Calamity Jean

   About 10% of the rich's new income would restore the working class and
   fix the economy. But if you say that, they start screaming "Socialism".
   Who taught them to say that? Rich people.

   We're fools whether we dance or not, so we might as well dance.

 Among other things that need to be done... ([817]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [818]JeffW, [819]Calamity Jean

   Return to the rule that corporations cannot sit on large sums of cash.

   Legislate that the top corporate executives cannot hold multiple
   positions--i.e., CEO, Chairman of the Bd.

   Enforce Board liability.

   Make Board Members accountable to shareholders; most companies have
   rules that drastically limit or eliminate shareholder participation.
   It is precisely this insulation that permits the corruption.

   When caught doing all the outrageous things (EXECUTIVE PAY, e.g.),
   companies talk vaguely about profit and being for their shareholders.
   Stuff and nonsense.

 Of course its deliberate ([825]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [826]Calamity Jean

   the destruction of the independent US  economy is a deliberate step in
   the creation of a world run solely by banks.  A strong US would prevent
   this.

   The ultimate objective of the banksters is to reduce the world to this:

   1% who own EVERYTHING
   99% who own NOTHING and have no meaningful wage or means to support
   themselves.  These individuals will be shunted into service jobs (i.e.,
   to wait hand and foot on the wealthy).
   Property ownership will be restricted to the wealthy (i.e., feudal
   lords) while the peasants live at the mercy of their wealthy
   "benefactors" (AKA slavery)
   The surplus population will be starved and disenfranchised out of
   existence.  (aka. disposed of quietly).

   There will be no nations, no governments except that run by the banks.

 TYPO--"goRging" not "goUging" themselves! ([829]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [830]Calamity Jean, [831]OLinda

     Most importantly, the public bankers would be paid reasonable
     salaries rather than gouging themselves at the trough.

   I actually try to be pretty lenient on spelling/grammar issues on the
   internets, but in this case, I'm quite sure it reverses the intended
   meaning!
