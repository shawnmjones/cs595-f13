[22]Gomez refuses to release client list

   Gabriel Gomez is not a particularly forthcoming Senate candidate. For
   example, he [30]refuses to say whether he believes employers should be
   able to dictate health care choices for the women who work for them. He
   won't release his 2005 taxes, the ones that show that [31]tax scam
   problem, and he won't answer questions about it, either.

   He also [32]won't release his list of clients from the nine years he's
   worked at private equity firm Advent International, as the Senate
   candidate disclosure form requires.

   [33]Goal Thermometer

     "Gabriel Gomez's refusal to disclose the names of his clients is
     more than just a potential ethics violation-it suggests that he has
     something to hide, and it's time for Gomez to finally come clean
     with the people of Massachusetts by disclosing the names of his
     clients," Walsh will say.

     Gomez's client list became an issue for the Republican earlier this
     week when a progressive-leaning government watchdog group, Citizens
     for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed an ethics
     complaint against Gomez for failing to release those details.

   It does make one wonder. The issues surrounding Gomez, and the issues
   he refuses to talk about, open Gomez up to questions about just what
   else might be out there, not to mention how responsive he'd be to his
   constituents as senator. He sure doesn't care about transparency as a
   candidate.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [51]Tagging tips - [52]Search For Tags - [53]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [54]Civil
   Rights, [55]Community, [56]Congress, [57]Culture, [58]Economy,
   [59]Education, [60]Elections, [61]Energy, [62]Environment, [63]Health
   Care, [64]International, [65]Labor, [66]Law, [67]Media, [68]Meta,
   [69]National Security, [70]Science, [71]Transportation, or [72]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([73]California, [74]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       The law governing the disclosure form requires disclosure of all
       clients for which he did more than $5K of work, so there are only
       two possibilities: he violated the law, or he did not actually work

   Atlantic Ave. there my mother said, oh look, that must be the hotel.
   Nope, just somebody's house, and there were a lot of them like that.
   And the entire street is lined with Gabriel Gomez signs. He's a
   candidate because rich people are paying for him to be one, that's why.
