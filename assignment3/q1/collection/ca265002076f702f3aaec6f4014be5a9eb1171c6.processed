[24]Here's why Paul Ryan is the perfect guy to deliver the GOP rebuttal to
the president's inaugural

   U.S. representative (R-WI) Paul Ryan attends a vigil in Oak Creek,
   Wisconsin, August 7, 2012. The killings of six worshippers at a Sikh
   temple in Wisconsin has thrust attention on white power music, a
   thrashing, punk-metal genre that sees the white race u
   Earlier Tuesday, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) delivered [30]the definitive
   Republican smackdown on President Barack Obama's [31]second inaugural
   address:

     House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Tuesday
     accused
     President Obama of attacking "straw men" in his second inauguration
     speech,
     arguing that the president mischaracterized Republicans' position on
     federal entitlement programs.

     "No one is suggesting that what we call our earned entitlements -
     entitlements you pay for, like payroll taxes for Medicare and Social
     Security - are putting you in a `taker' category," Ryan said on
     conservative commentator Laura Ingraham's radio show. "No one would
     suggest that whatsoever."

     Ryan, the GOP's 2012 vice-presidential nominee and his party's
     leader when it comes to pressing for federal entitlement reform,
     contended that Obama made a "switcheroo" in his speech by suggesting
     that Republicans have referred to beneficiaries of those programs as
     "takers." In reality, he said, that term refers to recipients of
     welfare and other non-"earned" entitlements.

   Ooomph. Talk about a punishing barrage of brutal rhetorical blows.
   Seriously, that was epic. In fact, it's a good thing that President
   Obama already won his reelection campaign (beating none other than Paul
   Ryan in the process), because otherwise, I don't know if the president
   could ever hope to recover from Ryan's devastating critique.

   And let me be clear, I'm perfectly serious. As Ryan said, the president
   attacked a strawman. For example, when Ryan proposed ending Medicare as
   we know it, he wasn't doing so because he is against Medicare--it's
   just that he doesn't think it should exist, at least not as it
   currently stands. So it's a total strawman to say Paul Ryan isn't the
   most committed Medicare supporter in the world. After all, his mother
   is a Medicare recipient.

   Same goes for Social Security. Paul Ryan is the the biggest champion of
   Social Security ever to walk on the face of this earth. FDR pales in
   comparison. Nobody should ever forget Ryan's [32]stirring, emotional
   defense of the program when he spoke to the Ayn Rand Leadership Society
   of America (or whatever the name of the group was):

     But when you look at the fight that we're in here in Capital Hill,
     it's a tough fight. It's a very important fight. But we need more
     people on our side to fight this fight. That is why there is no more
     fight that is more obvious between the differences of these two
     conflicts than Social Security.  Social Security right now is a
     collectivist system, it's a welfare transfer system.

   See? President Obama was totally setting up a straw man when he
   suggested Republicans believe programs like Social Security "make us a
   nation of takers." That's nothing at all like what Republicans believe,
   certainly not Paul Ryan. Instead, he believes Social Security is a
   collectivist system. It's a wealth transfer system. That's totally
   different than "a nation of takers." Totes!

   Continue below the fold to find out which one of Paul Ryan's former
   bosses helped make his case in a secret video recorded during the 2012
   presidential campaign ...

   And keep in mind that Paul Ryan isn't the only Republican who has
   repeatedly gone on record with statements disproving President Obama's
   claim. Take, for example, Paul Ryan's former boss and 2012 Republican
   presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Here's [33]what he said on secret
   video during the campaign:

     There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president
     no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him,
     who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are
     victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for
     them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to
     housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the
     government should give it to them. And they will vote for this
     president no matter what...These are people who pay no income tax.

   Clearly, there's simply no evidence for President Obama to accuse
   Republicans of saying things like Social Security and Medicare turn us
   into a nation of takers. And there's really nobody better to make that
   case than Paul Ryan. Because neither he nor anybody that he's closely
   associated with has ever said anything that could possibly have been
   construed as anything less than a full-throated defense of the social
   safety net, from Medicare and Social Security on down.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [49]Civil
   Rights, [50]Community, [51]Congress, [52]Culture, [53]Economy,
   [54]Education, [55]Elections, [56]Energy, [57]Environment, [58]Health
   Care, [59]International, [60]Labor, [61]Law, [62]Media, [63]Meta,
   [64]National Security, [65]Science, [66]Transportation, or [67]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([68]California, [69]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       the inaugural platform?  He was standing right behind Beyonce and
       Jay-Z and he couldn't strike up a conversation with them.
       The elevation of appearance over substance, of celebrity over

   no one can go back 6 months or two years and find quotes backing up
   what Obama said. Ed Kilgore over at [318]Washington Monthly found this
   Ryan quote from 2010:

     Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan said in 2010 that
     60 percent of Americans receive more financial benefits from the
     government than they pay in taxes, making them "takers," rather than
     "makers," according to a 2010 video of Ryan speaking with Rep.
     Walter Jones (R-N.C.).
     "Right now about 60 percent of the American people get more benefits
     in dollar value from the federal government than they pay back in
     taxes," Ryan said. "So we're going to a majority of takers versus
     makers in America and that will be tough to come back from that.
     They'll be dependent on the government for their livelihoods
     [rather] than themselves."

   Sometimes I wonder if the speechwriters put little jabs like this in
   there to stir up the Republicans to say stupid things so the media can
   go back and find all their own quotes to prove them wrong.

       How often does the media actually do their job and go back and
       look?  Even more rare is when they do go back and look, how often
       do they actually call them out on it?
       You cannot blame the media though, if they called them out, they
       wouldn't get invited to all of the cocktail parties...

 Singapore's a city state with first world standard ([552]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [553]RichM, [554]VictorLaszlo

   of living.  It has some unique properties.

   Education
   20% of the national budget is spent on education.  While not free,
   education through college level is heavily subsidised

   Health care
   While nothing is free, health care is heavily subsidized to be
   affordable, and 70-80% of the population uses the public health care.
   This is paid for with mandatory deductions (similar to medicare) that
   subsidize the low income.  They rated 6th in the WHO rankings back in
   2000.  The public system is subject to supplemental health care which
   employers can offer as perks or individuals can buy if they're wealthy.

   Retirement
   They have a pension system, more or less similar to Social Security
   except the tax rate is 3x higher (36%) and encourage savings, but
   there's been problems with people investing most of their net worth in
   real-estate, and coming up short on cash when they retire.  (as you can
   imagine, real-estate in a city state isn't cheap)

   What they don't have is any kind of unemployment insurance (for
   disability or any other reason), and related to that, no welfare/dole
   type thing.  The cultural expectation is that the extended family takes
   care of those who can't work.   Note that with health care heavily
   subsidized, the main expense for taking care of an unemployed person is
   housing.

          [615]diggerspop, [616]m2old4bs

   ...furthermore, Ryan doesn't deny that he and his Republican colleagues
   are calling those getting non-earned entitlements "takers," he's just
   saying that it doesn't include Social Security or Medicare recipients,
   because we the People actually pay directly into those insurance
   programs.

   Unfortunately...Ryan's math doesn't add up...because...when you exclude
   Social Security and Medicare...certainly there are not 47 percent of
   the country that are "takers"from non-Social Security and Medicare
   programs.

   So...once again...either Lyin' Ryan's rhetoric, or his math don't add
   up (or, as is likely the case...neither add up).

   And...speaking of "straw men," what about Lyin' Ryan's constant love
   affair with two of the biggest straw men in political history: that our
   country is on the verge of collapse due to a debt that he and his
   fellow Republicans had not problem with when George Walker Bush was
   charging up our credit cards with needless war and unnecessary tax cuts
   for the filthy rich; and...that Social Security and Medicare are
   allegedly going bankrupt (neither program is not nor has ever been in
   danger of bankruptcy...and the only fiscal concerns with either of them
   is that if some relatively modest adjustments are not made to either
   program ever then they may not balance sometime in the distant future).

   When it comes to straw men...Lyin' Ryan should know...because his
   entire political career is made up of them.

 Well, actually, there's a right to life and living ([662]2+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [663]blue aardvark, [664]judyms9

   at least for humans, is dependent on food, shelter and a modicum of
   protection from natural disasters.
   "Entitlement" is actually a dysphemism for "rights." Since it wouldn't
   be politic to say that rights have to be earned, they call them
   "entitlements."
   But, the real issue is that, if rights are to be respected, then
   societal obligations have to be met. So, in the interest of efficiency,
   we select public servants to act as our agents and carry out societal
   obligations, as laid out in the Constitution. Except, that's not what
   Ryan and his cronies think they were selected for. Nor, for that
   matter, are they cut out to be public servants, since, other than the
   gift of gab, they have few practical skills. Which is why Ryan and his
   buds envision themselves as petty pols, whose mission it is to tell the
   polis what to do.
   They've just got it backwards. They think the chef eats and the
   customers cooks.
   Why do they make such a silly mistake? Because they don't know how to
   cook.
   The question is why we put up with this farce. And the answer would
   seem to be similar to why people stare at a cobra in a basket. They're
   fascinated.
   Admit it. Weren't you fascinated by the Ryan and Romney show?
