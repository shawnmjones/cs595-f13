   If you read astronomy sites as much as I do it would be easy to come
   away thinking the earth is smack dab in the center of something called
   a Goldilocks Zone. Technically it just means the distance from a star
   where water can exist on the surface of a planet as a liquid. Not too
   hot like Venus, not too cold like Mars. But this can easily be confused
   with perfect and truth be told, our planet coalesced just a bit too far
   out, a little too close to the cold side of the zone. Going by the
   influx sunlight on a spinning globe alone, the surface of the earth
   could be frozen solid. In fact there's good evidence that it has been
   frozen solid from pole to equator more than once over the last four
   billion years.

   There's a number of factors that keep the earth from being a permanent
   snowball. One of the big ones is our sun, it's slowly heating up, about
   5 percent to 10 percent every billion years. The other big one is the
   earth is not a barren ball of rock, we have oceans and snug blanket of
   air which soak up solar energy when the sun is out and distribute it
   more evenly around the planet 24/7. In the end, these two factors,
   which have preserved life and may have literally saved the entire
   biosphere from icy extinction will eventually roast and sterilize the
   entire planet until it's deader than fried chicken. Best estimates?
   That probably won't begin in earnest for roughly one billion more
   years. Unless of course our estimates are off, and especially if we
   were to offer a big fat assist in roasting the planet, you know, to
   make a few bucks for a few already super wealthy people. It could start
   with a burp, a burp of freedom!

   More on the snowball earth below the fold.

   If we could go back to the [30]Cryogenian period, beginning about 850
   million years ago, earth would have more resembled the fictional
   ice-planet Hoth in Star Wars. Except for the atmosphere, which would
   have supported neither tauntaun nor rebel alliance, as it probably
   consisted mostly of nitrogen with no oxygen at all. Evidence shows this
   was the most extensive and severe series of glaciations our planet has
   ever known. It's widely believed that some of the glaciers may have
   extended all the way to the equator, meaning the earth was sheathed in
   ice from pole to pole, across ocean and land.

   Models show the snowball earth is an incredibly stable state. Left
   alone, huge amounts of sunlight is reflected by the ice and snow back
   into space, zero humidity means very little cloud cover. The snowball
   is an end point, with no escape. Except obviously there was or we
   wouldn't be here.

   There is one set of phenomena the snowball wouldn't affect: Geological
   processes like thermal vents, volcanoes, geysers and the like would
   continue uninterrupted. With almost no rainfall and little in the way
   of weather, any greenhouse gases released by those hot spots would hang
   around a long, long time. Long enough to accumulate. Once they reached
   a certain threshold, the temperature at the equator would begin to tip
   above the freezing point of water, after that, watch out! Water absorbs
   way more sunlight than ice, it would heat up and melt more ice, and the
   cycle would run away with itself, faster and faster.

   Models show the amount of time from the first narrow leads in the ice
   developing around the equator to an earth completely ice free, could
   have occurred in as little as 100 years, with almost half of the
   melting coming in the last decade! During which time the average global
   temperature could easily skyrocket a whopping 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
   It would have been about as a dramatic a climate transformation as our
   world has ever undergone, from clear alpine white snowball earth under
   crystal clear blue skies, to steamy ocean planet shrouded in thick rain
   clouds under which long lasting category six or seven supercanes and
   super cells spawning F-10 tornadic vortices churned the seas and
   scoured the land. This cycle of icy boom and bust appears to have
   happened more than once.

   But eventually the Cryogenian ended and gave way to the [31]Ediacaran,
   which gave way to the more famous [32]Cambrian, and the rest is natural
   history. Here we are.

   Today we have permanent ice caps on both poles, probably an unusual
   state of affairs over the last half billion years or so. The primary
   agent keeping the planet cool enough to keep those global
   air-conditioners running is likely the geographic and thermal isolation
   of Antarctica. But the sun is hotter now than it was when the
   Cryogenian started, all the earth needs is fuel for a tipping point to
   lose those ice caps. And over the last few hundred million years that
   fuel has been laid down in thick deposits all over the poles and into
   the temperate boundaries surrounding them. That fuel may be about to
   light up, a new study suggests the near term cost could reach a
   staggering $60 trillion dollars, the long term effects could be
   [33]literally apocalyptic:

     Billions of tonnes of the greenhouse gas methane are trapped just
     below the surface of the East Siberian Arctic shelf. Melting means
     the area is poised to deliver a giant gaseous belch at any moment -
     one that could bring global warming forward 35 years and cost the
     equivalent of almost a year's global GDP.

     These are the conclusions of the first systematic analysis of the
     economic cost of Arctic melting, which delivers a sobering antidote
     to other, more upbeat assessments that say melting in this area
     would improve access to minerals on the ocean bed, increase fishing
     and create ice-free shipping lanes.

   That's just the East Arctic Shelf, there are megatons of methane stored
   elsewhere in both landlocked permafrost and [34]methane hydrates at the
   bottom of the world's ocean. Once any of it gets belched into the
   atmosphere in quantity we may see a runaway feedback loop, melting more
   ice and tundra, leading to more methane release and more absorption of
   sunlight, all the way to the grim end: a steamy stormy ocean planet
   with no cryosphere to speak of marked by raging, rising water driven by
   long lasting hurricanes and tornadoes over land and sea.

   How fast could that happen? We simply don't know. It might not happen
   at all, or could take millennia to develop, or it could virtually
   explode into that state given the right kick and forced onward by a sun
   now substantially hotter than it was 850 million years ago. And
   apparently we should not try to stop this. Because ... freedom ...?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [50]Civil
   Rights, [51]Community, [52]Congress, [53]Culture, [54]Economy,
   [55]Education, [56]Elections, [57]Energy, [58]Environment, [59]Health
   Care, [60]International, [61]Labor, [62]Law, [63]Media, [64]Meta,
   [65]National Security, [66]Science, [67]Transportation, or [68]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([69]California, [70]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       that it's hard for most people to comprehend.
       Let me break it down (and this may end up as a diary if y'all like
       it).
       Consider the case of doomed-to-drown Miami. Its contribution to
       national GDP was $263 billion in 2010.
       A city is land, commerce, and people.
       I don't know what Miami real estate is worth. A lot. Billions? It's
       all going to be abandoned. Ditto its infrastructure - roads,
       schools, hospitals, drug warehouses, nightclubs and restaurants,
       malls filled with boutiques selling cute bikinis, etc. All gone.
       A few people will try to physically move houses, but not many. Most
       people will just relocate...where?
       Some will cling to the city, moving to higher ground, figuring out
       canals and kayaks and bridges. But most  will leave. Businesses
       will leave. This contraction will play out over decades, or less if
       there's a big hurricane, and it will be painful.
       I ask people what it costs to abandon Miami, and I get blank
       stares, shrugs, mumbles "billions," but no one knows where to start
       that calculation.
       The language to calculate what climate change will cost us hasn't
       been invented yet.
       Anyone know what the slow contraction of Detroit from 1950s or
       1970s to the bankruptcy has done to the American economy? That will
       be Miami.
       Now, multiply Miami. Over and over again.

       dollar estimates of costs when discussing the destruction of our
       shared ecosphere is borderline obscene. Not to mention completely
       futile. What will a dollar actually be worth in real value when the
       food chain doesn't work anymore, when refugees are swarming across
       the land, and law and order is best remembered as a worn out tv
       show?
       Aside from tinder, it will be useless.More important is that that
       $60 T figure certainly represents  human and animal death on a
       scale we have not seen in recorded history.

       By mid-decade the arctic will have no ice for part of the summer.
       When the arctic has no summer ice all the water is above freezing.
       When the water is above freezing the nearby land is also above
       freezing.
       When the nearby land is above freezing the methane comes out.
       When the methane comes out the global temperature rises.
       When global temperature rises the next summer no-ice period will be
       longer.
       Lather, rinse, repeat...
       It's something of a simplification but I find it gets the point

       after which we can cut back on fossil fuels all we want, but it
       won't make any difference.  The amount of methane locked in the
       tundra is more than enough to create a runaway situation.  At that

       But the fact that this is not a natural occurrence, and is
       exacerbated by existing human degradation in all manner of forms
       (coastal remaking, pesticide saturation, chemicals of all sorts

       every scenario I've seen floated for large scale geo engineering
       carries enormous, harmful unintended consequences.
       some are limited in affected area, but none seems without great
       price, and none are close to both reversing our increasing
       emissions and the coming release of  arctic methane. And that's IF
       the big boys can play nice and actually try to salvage
       civilization.
       More likely a few billionaires like Richard Branson will tilt at

       but seeing as I work for a company specializing in filtration, I
       believe that we could sufficiently filter it relatively cheaply.
       The expense would be in the pipelines themselves.  To carry enough
       water to make a difference, they would have to be large and
       plentiful. If a pipe was 6 feet in diameter then we could expect a
       flow rate of about 9,000 gallons per second.  If the flood lasted
       one week and at a continuous flow, that would equate to 54 billion
       gallons of water.
       That may sound like a lot but considering but considering we are
       pulling approximately 50 billion gallons out of the ground a day,
       it would take a lot of pipelines to just slow down the loss.
        The cost would have to be compared to what it would cost to let
       the aquifiers continue to dry up.

       County Va way out in the country for 8 years. We had enjoyed the

   start to "burp".

   Any ship above one of these bubbles  will suddenly find itself dropping

   I have an issue with the cost thing though...

     cost the equivalent of almost a year's global GDP

   I have long argued against people talking about the prohibitive cost of
   going back to the moon.  I argue that going to the moon the first time
   cost us less than nothing and going back again could save the world
   from economic destruction.

   When we went to the moon, we didn't bundle up all of the money and send
   it off into space, never to be seen again.  The U.S. government spent
   almost all of the money here in America and that money went to
   scientists and engineers and workers at NASA and hundreds of other
   small companies working on contracts who all hired lots of people who
   all paid taxes and bought things with that money.  Probably close to
   20% of what the government spent came straight back to America in the
   form of taxes collected.  The majority of the rest was circulated
   within the economy and created demand of other other products which
   snowballed helping our economy.

   Where we made it less than zero was the advances in technology that
   were born of necessity because of this endeavor.  These technological
   advances made the United States the world's technology leader for many
   years to come.  We were without a doubt, a world economic superpower in
   spite of supposed high taxes and high government spending in Vietnam
   and on NASA.

   If we have the catastrophic conditions you suggest (and I believe that
   we may very well see) it would not cost the world anything
   economically.  We have a choice here on earth to pay for it now and
   prevent the suffering or pay for it later and do it in spite of the
   suffering.  Just like any disaster, we may not think we have any money
   in this country but I guarantee you if Russia attacked us, we would
   find enough money to go to war tomorrow without anyone even bringing up
   the budget.

   No matter when we spend the money, now or later, it will create jobs,
   stimulate the economy and not cost the American Government anything as
   long as they hire American workers and then learn from the technology
   that is created.

   years ago, according to a 2008 "genographic" study of mitochondrial
   DNA. The DNA record indicates that Homo Sapiens was reduced to as few
   as 2,000 individuals.

   The geological record suggests massive droughts in Africa in the
   preceding period confined our ancestors to isolated pockets of viable
   habitat. Yet, as the climate became more benign, it only took 10,000
   years for our numbers to rebound and the migration out of Africa to
   begin.

   I'm convinced that our genes will survive any future catastrophe. But
   there are 6.6 billion of us now... the die-off is going to be ugly
   indeed.

   We will survive, but many less adaptable species are going to go
   extinct: Gorillas, elephants, tigers, whales... Our descendents may
   mourn their loss, but it's unlikely that they will live in a society
   that cannot afford sentimentality of any kind.

   It isn't human survival we're fighting for... It's the idea of
   civilization that we've been trying perfect since Plato and Confucius.
   It's the compassion for our fellow humans that we've tried to uphold
   since Buddha and Jesus; It's the "liberal" society that we've been
   struggling toward since Locke and Rousseau.

   That's what we'll lose if we crash the biosphere.

   But humanity itself will survive.

     850 million years ago, earth would have more resembled the fictional

     consisted mostly of nitrogen with no oxygen at all.

   Given that by that time oxygenic photosynthesis had been in process for
   more than 2 billion years, "no oxygen at all" seems a bit extreme...
   Yeah, it was oxidizing iron, dissolving in the water, etc. But that
   didn't keep the atmosphere at 0! [899]Wiki has a nice graph which looks
   to be estimating atmospheric O2 at -.85Ga about 1.5 to 3%. This would
   totally not make you and me happy - I'd agree with you on the tauntaun
   and the Alliance - but it's not "no oxygen at all."

       There's a great novel called "A Canticle for Liebowitz" that
       describes a cyclical history (punctuated by nuclear war and a crash
       of civilization). Liebowitz is a 'saint' from our time, though no
       saint at all; he simply had a few details of his life preserved
       when his generation was wiped out by war. The central character is
       a monk whose calling is to preserve the artifacts of St Liebowitz
       as civilization gears up for another nuclear war...
       Point being that most of the defining connections between events
       will almost certainly be lost in the ongoing chaos, and what gets
       reconstructed in a potentially calmer time will rely on oral
       tradition, with all its local coloring and revisionism.
