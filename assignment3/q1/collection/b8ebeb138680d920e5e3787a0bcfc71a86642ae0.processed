   WASHINGTON--President Obama left attendees of the White House
   Correspondents' Association Dinner in stitches Saturday night after
   delivering a hilarious speech repeatedly telling the entire room to
   "fuck off." "No, seriously, each and every one of you cocksuckers can
   go fuck yourselves; I fucking hate all of you," Obama said to the
   uproarious laughter and applause of the assembled politicians and media
   personalities. "Stop laughing. I'm not fucking kidding, idiots. All of
   you gathered here today are a bunch of spineless, hypocritical pieces
   of shit, and I have absolutely zero respect for anyone in this room.
   So, fuck you all, and may you and your families go straight to fucking
   hell." Critics have praised Obama's performance at the annual dinner,
   saying the president's jokes were sharp and his timing has "never been
   better."
