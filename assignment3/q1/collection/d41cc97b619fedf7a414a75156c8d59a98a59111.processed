[97]Right-to-work bills moving in Ohio House? Not so fast

   Two right-to-work bills introduced by Rep. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson,
   will have their first hearing today in the Ohio Houseâs Manufacturing
   and Workforce Development Committee. But that doesnât mean the
   legislation is on the move.

   House rules dictate that all bills receive at least one hearing if
   theyâre introduced early enough in the session. Roegnerâs bills are
   merely receiving their mandatory hearing today.

   Roegner and Rep. Ron Maag, R-Lebanon, each introduced right-to-work
   bills in May. Maagâs bill, which has yet to receive a hearing, would
   prohibit public employers from requiring workers to join a union or pay
   dues. Roegner has a similar bill for private employees, along with a
   proposal to ask voters whether to put a right-to-work clause in the
   state Constitution.

   The moves to introduce right-to-work legislation come less than two
   years after Republicans tried and failed to limit collective bargaining
   by public employees. This time, Maag and Roegner worked independently
   of the majority Republican caucus in deciding to introduce the bills,
   said Mike Dittoe, spokesman for Speaker Bill Batchelder, R-Medina.

   Soon after the billsâ introduction, Senate President Keith Faber,
   R-Celina, said right-to-work legislation [104]wasnât on his caucusâ
   agenda. That effectively killed the billsâ chances of becoming law.
   âThe only purpose this discussion serves right now

   is to generate a bunch of breathless fundraising appeals from the Ohio
   Democratic Party,â he said in a statement.

   Indeed, Kyle McDermott, executive director of the [105]Ohio Democratic
   Party, on Monday sent out a fundraising plea.

   âThis threat is real. The bills have been introduced and are just
   sitting there for Gov. (John) Kasich and his extreme Republican
   colleagues to bully through at a momentâs notice,â McDermott said in
   the e-mail.Â âMakeÂ a donation today and send Governor Kasich and all
   his allies a message that we will not allow them to move this so-called
   right-to-work bill an inch more.â

   Have an opinion on whether the right-to-work bills should move further?
   Find and contact your state representative [106]on this page, or e-mail
   Ohio House [107]majority or [108]minority leadership.
