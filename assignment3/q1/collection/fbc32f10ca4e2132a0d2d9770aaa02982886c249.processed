     Texas lawmakers are currently rushing an omnibus anti-abortion bill
     through a special session, after each of its provisions failed to
     advance separately during the regular legislative session. But not
     without being met with a fight. Over 700 Texans traveled to Austin
     on Thursday to testify against the anti-abortion measure before it
     could come to a vote in the House -- and their "people's filibuster"
     successfully prevented the legislation from advancing.

     Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who electrified anti-war
     liberals during the 2004 presidential race, said Thursday he would
     consider another run for the White House - a statement that will
     surely be met with mixed reaction in the Democratic Party.

     Dean, whose underdog presidential campaign officially launched 10
     years ago this weekend, said he has "mixed feelings" about running
     for office again but added he would consider another bid for the
     Democratic presidential nomination if he doesn't think the other
     candidates are adequately addressing progressive issues that are
     dear to his heart.

       news of the farm bill failure, "The Republican War on Data,"
       maneuvering on immigration reform, and Tom Edsall's NYT opinion

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [58]Civil
   Rights, [59]Community, [60]Congress, [61]Culture, [62]Economy,
   [63]Education, [64]Elections, [65]Energy, [66]Environment, [67]Health
   Care, [68]International, [69]Labor, [70]Law, [71]Media, [72]Meta,
   [73]National Security, [74]Science, [75]Transportation, or [76]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([77]California, [78]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       "But that position ignores the fact that the 45.5 million Hispanics
       already in this country legally are registering to vote and are
       seeing the Republican Party as distinctly hostile. The more the GOP
       comes to be seen as fighting immigration reform, the more difficult
       it will be for Republican candidates to compete for this group of
       voters. Remember, 50,000 Hispanic citizens reach voting age every

   I find it fascinating how Howard Dean managed to craft a liberal image
   for himself despite having a fairly conservative record as governor of
   Vermont.

   St. Petersburg Times, 2003: "The joke among a lot of Vermont
   Republicans was that they didn't need to run anyone for governor
   because they basically had one in office already," said Harlan
   Sylvester, a conservative Democratic stockbroker and longtime adviser
   to Dean.

       I recall the early excitement for him back in the day.
       Hillary has done much, but she still is a bit tied to the DLC and
       her votes supporting the Iraq war.
       I really think Dean has progressive ideas, including how to better
       the Democratic party as a whole, what with his 50 state strategy to
       go with better health care and more citizen involvement.  Go Dean!

       could do wonders as Massachusetts' senior Senator, taking over from

       "Liberal Hawk".
       When Dean surged because he was unequivocally anti-War, it was an
       indictment of the "Very Serious People" in DC.
       The VSPs both in politics, and in the press, hated him.

          [212]sacrelicious, [213]Meteor Blades

   Maybe radicalism is too big a word, but the press and mainstream Dems
   see him as some crazy guy, and that was before the manufactured scream.

   Informed folks (including Kossaks) were well aware back on '03 and '04
   that Dean's positions were not flaming lefty by any means, that he was
   rather a centrist Dem.

   BUT . . . he was in your face straightforward no bullshit, and that
   made ALL the difference.

   There were no euphemisms, or leaving room for himself to backpedal, or
   triangulation bs with Dean.  Whatever position he did have, he was
   straight up and didn't back down.  And that was amazing.

   He represented the Democratic Party brand with full force, aggressively
   and with an offensive, not defensive, approach.  Who'd have thunk that
   you could promote Dem principles forthrightly - and win on them!?  He
   did - don't back down...

   Would love to see this guy back in the picture - any picture.  I'd
   rather take a moderate guy who fights and leads with what he's got,
   than a marginally more liberal person who hems, haws and sells it all
   out.

       why would anyone be surprised?
       Paula Deen is exactly who she says she is and always has been.  If
       she invented her Southern Belle persona, it would include all the
       things which she believes are true to form.  Racism would be one of
       them, although she would not call it that.  She would call it
       "Being Southern".
       When someone is impatient and says, "I haven't got all day," I
       always wonder, How can that be? How can you not have all day?

 Hey, I met Lindsay Graham a couple weeks ago.... ([254]7+ / 0-)

          [258]msmacgyver, [259]MeToo, [260]Meteor Blades, [261]Caipirinha

   His SC campaign manager is a colleague of mine from high school and we
   reconnected after our 20th high school reunion.

   Anyway, he asks if I want to meet the senator, I say sure. So we go to
   his rowhouse catercorner to the Capitol building. Before we go in, he
   says "Let me just set your expectations right now. The Senator is a
   bachelor and he kind of lives like one." Uhhh...ok, I thought. I had
   assumed this was code for "he's gay", but that was not the message he
   was sending.

   Knock knock "LINDSAY, its X! I've got a friend who wants to meet you."
   The Senator lumbers towards the top of the stairs. His hair is standing
   on end from too much product and he's wearing a wife beater and boxers.
   "Come on in boys, get comfortable."

   Whoa.

   So we go upstairs. About 15 empty pizza boxes are strewn throughout the
   room. Empty diet coke bottles everywhere. There is a cinderblock
   coffeetable in front of a big screen TV. He props his legs up on the
   "table" with his legs apart. He lives like a fraternity pledge....I was
   expecting to see an 8-foot bong, but no dice.

   Anyway, so my brain is oozing out of my head during this Fellini-esque
   experience. We shoot the breeze and we start talking about politics.
   This is also kind of interesting. He says (paraphrasing):

   If I wanted to get elected indefinitely, I could. I know what buttons
   to push. But I'm sick of it. I'm up here doing nothing. If I'm going to
   get anything accomplished, I've got to put my vote in play. If I win
   this year, I'm done just being a goalie.

   For the record, they are concerned about a challenge from the right in
   the primaries. Word has it that there are a couple multimillionaires
   who are ready to jump in the race and could pull a Murdoch. He said
   Citizens United makes every race a free for all. Maybe its a good
   thing?

   Anyway, that's what happened. Nice guy. Pretty smart. Lives in a sty
   and I wanted to call him Dude. I suspect he's going to be a
   Goldwater/Crist type who will be a post-career rejector of the GOP.

   The Food Network needs to fire her or their network will bring scrutiny
   on itself and the culture they've built. It'll rekindle interest in
   allegation of Guy Fieri's alleged homophobia:

     Fieri also needed protection from homosexuals, or at least advance
     warning. Early in the show's run, Page got a phone call from Fieri,
     who'd just walked out of a restaurant in a huff.

     "Guy had decided that the two men running the restaurant were life
     partners," Page remembers. "He said, 'You can't send me to talk to
     gay people without warning! Those people weird me out!'"

       There's a political element to this too because George Will used to
       beat up on PBS as irrelevant by pointing, among other things, to
       TFN as providing one of the services PBS offered but without
       reliance on the government. Why go to PBS to learn how to cook when
       you can go to The Food Network, he argued? He claimed everything
       PBS offered by way of programming was already being offered by
       other networks. Capitalism over government, IOW.
       But like all corporate controlled networks(like Oxygen), TFN
       eventually lost its way and now barely features cooking
       instruction. It's all cupcake wars---which is so stupid it
       hurts(and manages, somehow, to not even teach its audience how to
       make cupcakes)! Even worse, TFN has that creepy show w/the guy who
       spies on people with cameras.
       So once again, George Will is wrong.

     Alaska Governor Signs Stand Your Ground Into Law At Shooting Range

     More than a year after the tragic shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon
     Martin on a Florida street drew national attention to Stand Your
     Ground laws, and with shooter George Zimmerman's trial set to begin
     next week, no state has successfully repealed its law authorizing
     the unfettered use of deadly force. But on Thursday, Alaska became
     the latest state to adopt a Stand Your Ground law, with Gov. Sean
     Parnell (R) signing the law and several other gun bills at a
     shooting range.

     "The resolutions, the legislation we sign today are our declaration
     that we are strong supporters here in the last frontier of our
     Second Amendment," Parnell said during the signing. Alaska Public
     Radio reports that Parnell wanted to send a message by signing this
     bill and several others that fight "federal overreach" at the
     shooting range.

     Alaska joins at least 21 other states that have passed Stand Your
     Ground or similar laws that impose no duty to retreat when facing an
     "attacker." The ALEC and NRA-backed laws have cleared those involved
     in fatal shootings of any criminal liability, and pave the way for
     arbitrary determinations of guilt and innocence that can facilitate
     racial bias.
