[22]CNN poll: Republicans only ones wrapped up in scandal

   President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton appear
   together in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House for
   statements and to answer questions from the media, December 10, 2010.
   Something about Democratic presidents drives Republicans nuts
   President Obama's net approval rating in CNN's [29]latest poll has gone
   from -3 in March (47 percent approve, 50 percent disapprove) to to +8
   in May (53 percent approve, 45 percent disapprove), a gain of 11
   points.

   Yeah, you read that right. According to CNN, President Obama is now
   more popular now than he was two months ago. People think he's doing a
   better job.

   So much for a presidency in disarray. In the aftermath of the GOP
   holding hearings with "Benghazi whistleblowers," the release of
   Benghazi talking points emails, the IRS scandal, and the AP phone
   records subpoena ... Obama isn't just unshaken, he's stronger than he
   was two months ago.

   For Republicans, this wasn't the plan. Americans weren't supposed to be
   shrugging this stuff off--they were supposed to be lapping it up. Obama
   was supposed to be on the ropes, maybe even pondering resignation.
   Instead, outside the GOP bubble, it's a big "meh."

   But there is some "good" news for Republicans. Greg Sargent looked at
   the numbers and [30]reports the GOP base is still solidly in the
   bubble:

     In the case of the IRS and Benghazi stories, the lurid and nefarious
     view of Obama's involvement in them being peddled by the right is
     held only by Republicans -- big majorities of them -- while most
     moderates and independents, i.e. the middle of the country, believe
     the White House's arguments.

   So, congratulations Republicans. You still have your base. They still
   hate Obama. And now you've convinced them there's not one, not two, but
   three reasons to impeach him. Good luck with that.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [44]Civil
   Rights, [45]Community, [46]Congress, [47]Culture, [48]Economy,
   [49]Education, [50]Elections, [51]Energy, [52]Environment, [53]Health
   Care, [54]International, [55]Labor, [56]Law, [57]Media, [58]Meta,
   [59]National Security, [60]Science, [61]Transportation, or [62]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([63]California, [64]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       In both the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal and GOP's overeach into the
       end of life care for Terry Schiavo the media decided unanimously to
       side with the Republicans. In both cases the public collectively
       yawned and decided that there was no there there. Republican's
       endless Obama scandal of the day is shaping up to play out exactly
       the same way. It does not mean that the public at large will change
       their voting habits or opinions. It just means that the current
       narrative is being dismissed by the public and the GOP are loosing
       the battle to reshape public opinion on who the current good guys
       and bad guys are in Washington.

       Republicans believe a lot of things, many of which are not
       connected to reality--such as all the "scandals" hurting the
       president politically, when in fact they're not hurting him with
       any group that doesn't already hate him, as this poll demonstrates.
       I doubt there will every be a more spectacular and entertaining
       example of the Repub alternate-reality bubble bursting than on
       election night last November.  But they quickly created a new one,
       stepped into it, and have been safely residing there again ever
       since.
       Now they're using these "scandals" to explain to themselves how
       Obama "stole" the election somehow, which when compared to what the
       Bush team did in 2000 and 2004, is a fairly inept and ineffective
       way to steal an election.

       They just have to believe there is little or no political cost to
       them doing so. If the American electorate withheld votes from
       misbehaving politicians it'd be a different story. But American
       voters pay scant attention and forget. So mudslingers can go to
       work with little risk of downside. Keep throwing mud and hope some

   Okay, so I was thinking the other day about how Republicans seem to
   have this visceral reaction against the legitimacy of Democratic
   presidents (even though, as we all know, the most recent illegitimate
   president was our good Republican friend Dubya).  If a Democrat is
   asked to name a Republican president that he/she likes, the answer will
   probably be Eisenhower (going back a half century), Teddy Roosevelt
   (another half century back), or Lincoln (another half century back).
   [I am, of course, ignoring the party hacks who weirdly extol Reagan.]

   If Republicans are asked to name their favorite Democratic
   president--or most favorite in recent history, whom do they cite?
   Truman is the only one in the 20th century that I can't see inspiring a
   knee-jerk hatred.

       about [370]Republicans.
       For example:  "Republicans approve of the American farmer, but they
       are willing to help him go broke. They stand four-square for the
       American home--but not for housing. They are strong for labor--but
       they are stronger for restricting labor's rights. They favor
       minimum wage--the smaller the minimum wage the better. They endorse
       educational opportunity for all--but they won't spend money for
       teachers or for schools. They think modern medical care and
       hospitals are fine--for people who can afford them. They consider
       electrical power a great blessing--but only when the private power
       companies get their rake-off. They think American standard of
       living is a fine thing--so long as it doesn't spread to all the
       people. And they admire the Government of the United States so much
       that they would like to buy it."

   The Democratic Base will put this behind them.  The Republican Base and
   Republican Politicians will persist.  Democrats will forget that this
   was a Republican issue.  Then, in 2014, during the Mid-term elections,
   when voter turnout is down anyway, Republican Base operatives will be
   motivated and, unless, the Democratic operatives are able to remind
   Democratic voters of the consequences, we will see another off-year
   disaster like 2010.

       in the wake of the coverage in question, then it was certainly
       illegal and a 1stA / 4thA violation.  I think there is basis for
       different views at this point, but I haven't heard a solid defense
       of the issuance of the subpoena.  It just doesn't look like the
       other 2 issues at all.  I think D's should be investigating it (as
       we no doubt would if it were an R labelled president).

 Seems reasonable ([849]0+ / 0-)
       We can assert the law is a crap law but we cannot assert acts
       allowed under that law are illegal. As I understand the story, the
       subpoena was issued only after alternate methods had failed. That
       being said, an investigation could be quite welcome. It could
       perhaps find transgressions or perhaps more likely, shed light on
       how the law is flawed.
       That being said, I doubt what we'd get is an investigation. We'd
       get a performance circus, probably, and probably an open-ended
       witch hunt to go with it.

 It's called reaping what you sow. ([853]0+ / 0-)

   No one could have hit CBS news in it's golden age without being slammed
   to the mat.  Now it's a non-issue because "news" is Kim Kardashian's
   diet secrets.  People aren't as dumb as a lot of Progressives think
   they are.  They watch local news, maybe NPR, mostly see "News" as a
   silly Yahoo feed.  They don't care about government overreach when it's
   a media with no value to them.

   I'm not looking for a love that will lift me up and carry me away. A
   love that will stroll alongside and make a few amusing comments will
   suffice.

       jumping on Murdoch's bandwagon.  He started with USA Today, the

       newspapers are nearly dead and they're still doing it wrong.  TV is

   in these pseudo-scandals. The Left continues to be obsessed with the AP
   phoney-scandal - as if a free press and real journalism exits anywhere
   outside of the Left's contra-reality bubble.

   Let's not forget that it was the "free press", in the guise of the N.Y.
   Times, and its Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Judith Miller, who
   spread Dick Cheney's LIES about Iraqi WMD's that led the 2003 March to
   war against Iraq.

   The racist Right attacks president Obama over the IRS and Benghazi
   pseudo-scandals, while the looney Left attacks Mr Obama over the AP
   phoney-scandal. The result? Obama's popularity and approval ratings
   improve.

   All I can say is, Please continue, racist Right and looney Left. The
   American people are far more concerned with dinner-table issues to set
   their hair on fire over these three fake, phoney, fraudulent
   non-issues.

   I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of the Republican Party.

 I wouldn't be so cavalier.. ([888]0+ / 0-)

   about this:

     So, congratulations Republicans. You still have your base. They
     still hate Obama. And now you've convinced them there's not one, not
     two, but three reasons to impeach him. Good luck with that.

   These are the same people who believe that they may have to take on
   governmental tyranny with their guns, if their strongly-held wingnut
   beliefs are thwarted.
   We have a real problem with treasonous (look it up) behavior by GOP
   congressional and right-wing media figures; even though there's no
   "there" there, the wingers will be frustrated when nothing
   materializes.
   Sorta like the 2012 election, that everyone knew was in the bag for
   Romney, except for the facts.
   So the base continues to be lied to, continues to believe the lies.. I
   curse St. Ronnie for the destruction of the Fairness Doctrine.
