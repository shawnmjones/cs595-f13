Roller coaster ride became 'nightmare' for Texas woman's family

   By Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN
   updated 3:15 PM EDT, Mon July 22, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Six Flags Over Texas says it's committed to finding out what caused
       a woman's death
     * In Facebook posts, Rosy Esparza's family calls the experience a
       "nightmare"
     * Authorities say there is no sign of "foul play or criminality"
     * Witnesses tell CNN affiliates that the woman didn't feel safe
       before the ride

   (CNN) -- It was Rosy Esparza's first trip to Six Flags.

   She sat on the Texas Giant, a 14-story-high roller coaster that
   [41]boasts what the amusement park calls "the world's steepest drop."

   Minutes later, one of the roller coaster's seats came back empty.

   Now Esparza is dead and Six Flags Over Texas representatives say the
   theme park is committed to finding out what led to the woman's death on
   Friday.

   Esparza's son-in-law and his wife were sitting in front of her at the
   time. Contrary to witness accounts reported by CNN affiliates, Ronald
   Segovia told CNN he did not hear his mother-in-law mention that her
   seat did not lock properly.

   Segovia also told CNN that Esparza was sitting by herself, contrary to
   initial reports that she was sitting beside her son. Her sons,
   according to Segovia, were not there.

   In Facebook posts on Saturday, her sons described the experience as a
   nightmare.

   A flood of condolences and prayers poured in.

   "Only God knows Mama," Amado Esparza posted in Spanish along with a
   photo showing a group of people praying at the amusement park,
   "something that I will always have as a memory of you is that you loved
   adventures."

   Later, he described his mother as his best friend.

   "It is sad to lose my mom," he wrote, "but I am happy that when she was
   alive she enjoyed it to the fullest. I always took her to explore new
   places."

   On Saturday, authorities said an initial investigation showed [42]no
   sign of foul play in the woman's death.

   "At this point of the investigation, it does not appear there was any
   foul play or criminality associated with this tragic incident," the
   Arlington Police Department said in a statement.

   Park visitors told [43]CNN affiliate WFAA they saw the woman fall.

   "She goes up like this," Carmen Brown told the affiliate, raising her
   hand up in the air. "Then when it drops to come down, that's when it
   released, and she just tumbled."

   Brown told [44]The Dallas Morning News that the woman had expressed
   concern to a park employee that she was not properly secured in her
   seat.

   "He was basically nonchalant," Brown said. "He was, like, 'As long as
   you heard it click, you're fine.' Hers was the only one that went down
   once, and she didn't feel safe. But they let her still get on the
   ride."

   Six Flags confirmed that a woman died Friday while riding the Texas
   Giant roller coaster, but did not provide further details.

   "Since the safety of our guests and employees is our number one
   priority, the ride has been closed pending further investigation," the
   theme park said in a statement.

   Six Flags Over Texas spokeswoman Sharon Parker said the park is
   committed to determining exactly what happened.

   "It would be a disservice to the family to speculate regarding what
   transpired," she said. "When we have new information to provide, we
   will do so."

   The Texas Giant was originally designed in 1990 as an all-wooden roller
   coaster. It was redesigned with a steel track and reopened in April
   2011 to mark the theme park's 50th anniversary.

   At its highest point, the roller coaster is 153 feet and has a drop of
   147 feet, according to the theme park.

   Authorities look at a number of factors when they investigate theme
   park accidents, said Bill Avery, an amusement ride and device safety
   consultant.

   "You're going to look at the operations of it, and the human factor,
   the human part of the equation," he told CNN. "Was there an error or
   omission made by an operator or someone in operations?"

   Maintenance and design would also be examined, he said, in addition to
   details such as the rider's posture and size.

   Avery, who founded a ride safety [46]consulting firm and once headed up
   safety at several parks, said there a few things visitors should keep
   in mind when it comes to securing safety restraints.

   "As a general rule," he said, "It needs to fit snugly near your
   waistline, above the top of your thighs, so it can hold the passenger
   in regardless of what kind of forces are applied, and where they're
   applied, on the human body."

   The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, a
   trade group representing amusement parks, describes them as "one of the
   safest forms of recreation available to the public."

   "Approximately 297 million guests visit the 400 U.S. amusement parks
   annually and take 1.7 billion safe rides," [47]the association says on
   its website.

   Visitors of fixed-site amusement parks -- places where rides are
   permanently attached to the ground -- have a 1 in 24 million chance of
   being seriously injured, the association said.

   CNN's Luisa Navarro, Fredricka Whitfield, Kevin Conlon, AnneClaire
   Stapleton and Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.
