[24]Unnamed Republicans pretend to care that Darrell Issa was rude

   Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) speaking at CPAC.
   Rep. Darrell Issa
   Anonymous Republican sources trotted over to Politico [30]to assure
   Beltway denizens that Darrell Issa has drawn rebuke from his party over
   calling White House spokesman Jay Carney a "paid liar."

     GOP leaders are concerned that the sometimes unpredictable chairman
     could jeopardize the biggest gift handed to them in months -- public
     outrage over the IRS scandal, combined with questions over Benghazi.
     They think Issa should stop personalizing the scandals by insulting
     Obama and his aides and focus on the facts. [...]

     "He has made this personal," one senior Republican told POLITICO.
     "He's added an unnecessary element to the news cycle."

     "When you make Jay Carney the issue, that's the problem," said
     another senior House GOP leadership aide. "No one cares about Jay
     Carney. That's a sideshow; it's not the real issue."

   They want Issa trying to gin something up about Benghazi and connect
   the White House to the IRS, in other words, they just don't want him to
   call people liars. The timing of this article is a little suspect,
   though, since it comes a day after the National Journal's Shane
   Goldmacher reported that Issa had not been reined in by his party's
   leadership over the "paid liar" comment. [31]In fact:

     House Majority Leader Eric Cantor singled out Issa for praise at a
     closed-door GOP conference meeting on Tuesday. Hours later, Cantor
     gave him plaudits on national television, saying on CNN that Issa
     and other GOP chairmen investigating the IRS were doing "a fantastic
     job." [...]

     "Chairman Issa is providing tough, effective, and appropriate
     oversight in the face of White House obstruction," said Michael
     Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner.

   Would they prefer Issa didn't make his insults of Jay Carney the issue?
   Maybe--but it's clear that, on the whole, Issa is doing exactly what
   Republican leadership wants by making unsourced claim after unsourced
   claim and flamboyantly drawing attention to his partisan
   investigations. Apparently some in the party aren't entirely
   comfortable with having that reported as bluntly as Goldmacher did,
   which is why we now get the Politico article and its heavy reliance on
   unnamed sources. Because the Villagers accept shoddy politicized
   investigations, but party leadership condoning such blatant incivility?
   Heavens, that's beyond the pale.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [48]Tagging tips - [49]Search For Tags - [50]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [51]Civil
   Rights, [52]Community, [53]Congress, [54]Culture, [55]Economy,
   [56]Education, [57]Elections, [58]Energy, [59]Environment, [60]Health
   Care, [61]International, [62]Labor, [63]Law, [64]Media, [65]Meta,
   [66]National Security, [67]Science, [68]Transportation, or [69]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([70]California, [71]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   to get them to go totally apeshit over Benghazi. With Rice as NSA and
   Power at the UN, they can keep trying to squeeze blood out of the
   turnip and keep coming up dry. And the longer they harp on it with no
   result, the more foolish they look. Americans didn't care about
   Benghazi in September. They didn't care about it in November. They
   certainly aren't going to care about it a year later where there is
   literally ZERO no information that changes the facts on the ground that
   all have accepted except the farthest of the far right in the GOP.

   Darrell Issa is a dick, pure and simple. and like all dicks is a

   So of course Eric sings Darrel's praises since Eric is a dick too!

   The only reason Issa starts focusing on Carney is because the GOP
   hasn't a clue what the issue is....because there is no there there.

       make an idiot of himself.

   The real issue is Issa - he is a thief and a criminal, a loudmouth
   bully who personifies the GOP perfectly. The Democratic Party should do
   the smart thing and poke at Issa. Make him react (since that is all he
   knows how to do) until he implodes and takes down the GOP with him.
   Give Issa enough rope and he is sure to hang himself.

       Yes, there is huge irony in Issa calling anyone a paid liar. But I
       am not on board with this "civility" nonsense. It's so often used
       to marginalize those on the left who have the gall to call a spade
       a spade. Dick Cheney was a murdering torturing criminal. Issa is a
       total douche bag. And yes, Jay Carney is in fact a paid liar, as
       were every previous WH press secretary. No one gains credibility in
       my eyes by pulling out the smelling salts over a true statement.
       Obviously the administration is going to feel compelled to pretend
       that this is an outrageous statement. The left blogosphere should
       be above all that nonsense.

       A smart investigator would keep his yap shut & his opinions to

       11 (eleven) Fast & Furious investigations that taxpayers paid for
