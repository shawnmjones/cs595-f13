   Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government will temporarily delay a
   controversial rule that would again[38] permit passengers to carry
   small knives on commercial flights three days before it was due to take
   effect.

   The Transportation Security Administration said in a statement on
   Monday it would consider additional input from a federal advisory
   committee that includes aviation-related interests, passenger
   advocates, and law enforcement experts before activating the new
   regulation.

   Airline passengers had been cleared to carry knives with small blades,
   including some pocket knives, beginning on Thursday. The TSA did not
   give a new date for the policy to take effect.

   Small knives were banned along with a host of other undersized sharp
   objects, like nail clippers, screwdrivers and cosmetic scissors, after
   the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.

   What a pocket knife could do on a plane

   There has been a gradual easing of those prohibitions in recent years
   as planes hardened onboard security and the potential threats shifted
   from hijackings to attempts by terrorists to bring down planes with
   bombs.

   Knives are probably the most common items surrendered by passengers at
   screening points, aside from liquids. About 35 knives are seen at
   Baltimore-Washington International Airport on an average day and about
   47 per day at Los Angeles International Airport, officials said
   recently.

   Under the plan, knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or shorter and
   less than a half-inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins so long as
   the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place.

   TSA Administrator John Pistole had previously told a House Homeland
   Security subcommittee that his decision on permitting small knives
   would stand. He said it would improve screening efficiency and allow
   security to focus on items that pose more serious threats to aviation.

   [40]Knives on a plane? Really?

   But Pistole has been under pressure from congressional lawmakers,
   flight crews and others concerned the change dangerously relaxed
   aviation security and sent the wrong message to a flying public eager
   for more simplicity and efficiency in passenger and bag screening.

   Some of the nation's biggest carriers have also opposed the policy.

   The TSA statement on Monday said the delay would enable security
   planners to weigh new feedback and continue workforce training.

   U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said the temporary move is a "solid,
   commonsense step" toward maintaining safe skies.

   "This delay acknowledges that permitting knives on planes is a bad
   idea; now the TSA should go the rest of the way and end this flawed
   policy all together," the New York Democrat said in a statement.

   Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, also approved of the
   delay.

   "Now TSA can go through the established process, seek input from
   stakeholders and consult with the (Transportation Security Officer)
   workforce -- so we can have a sensible security policy with stakeholder
   buy-in," the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee
   said in a statement.
