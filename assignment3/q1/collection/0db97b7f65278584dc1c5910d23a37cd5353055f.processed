[22]Open thread for night owls: Syria and the rules of war (in 1925)

   In Dissent, James R. Martin, writes [29]From Civilizing Missions to
   Collateral Damage: Syria and the Rules of War. An excerpt (with some
   added paragraph breaks to enhance readability):

    In the summer of 1925, a large revolt broke out in the French Syrian
     Mandate, a territory administered by France in conjunction with the
    League of Nations after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end
      of the First World War. The uprising began with the Druze in the
   semi-autonomous region of southern Syria, Jabal al-Druze. But given the
     unpopularity of French rule, it spread quickly throughout Syria and
   Lebanon and across sectarian lines. To their international humiliation,
       the French proved incapable of slowing its expansion, as major
   uprisings broke out in the cities of Hama and Homs (both centers of the
                              civil war today).

    In October 1925, as fighting raged in and around Damascus, the French
       army responded with brutal force: burning villages suspected of
     harboring insurgents, publicly parading the corpses of slain Syrian
   fighters, and indiscriminately shelling civilian areas in Damascus and
    its outskirts, which resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 civilians.
   The opposition was finally defeated in the summer of 1927. But the 1925
    bombardment of Damascus sparked an international controversy: did the
    direct targeting of civilian areas in and around Damascus violate the
     laws of war as they had been established in the late nineteenth and
                         early twentieth centuries?

   On the face of it, there seemed to be a strong case against the French.
     International law banned attacks against undefended and unfortified
    areas and direct targeting of private residences, schools, hospitals,
   and places of religious worship. The French attack on civilian areas in
   Damascus was clearly intended to break the population's morale, which,
    according to the leading American international lawyer Quincy Wright,
   qualified it as an act of terrorism: "As a normal military measure," he
          wrote, "the bombardment of Damascus cannot be justified."

       Wright faced a serious difficulty, though, in making a standard
      international legal case against the French: the fact that their
    actions took place outside of Europe and against a non-Christian and
   non-European population (although Syrian Christians did fight alongside
   Muslims and Druze in the revolt). It was unclear whether Syrians, as a
    "savage" or "semi-savage" people, qualified for the protection of the
   laws of war. At the time, the bounds of international law were seen as
     limited to the "civilized" world--namely, Christian Europe and its
    settler societies in North and South America. (Two exceptions to this
     rule were Japan and Ottoman Turkey.) Non-Christian and non-European
     peoples were not trusted to understand or obey the rule of law; as
                      such, they fell beyond its scope.

    The division of the world into civilized and uncivilized realms went
   beyond mere matters of doctrine: official legal guides that accompanied
          imperial armies into the colonial theater stipulated that
     intra-European rules of war did not apply in "wars with uncivilized
    States and tribes." Africans, Native Americans, and "Asiatic" tribes
   were all taken to be insufficiently advanced to obey civilized conduct
       in warfare; they could be dealt with as brutally as necessary.

    Wright's case hinged on whether Ottoman Turkey's ratification of the
       Hague Convention of 1899 entitled the occupants of Syria, as a
   territory formerly under Ottoman rule, to its protections. He conceded,
    though, that the failure of one party to observe civilized conduct in
   war allowed the other to commit otherwise illegal acts in response, and
   that this was a claim often made by Europeans to justify brutal conduct
     in colonial warfare. According to Wright's respondents, the Syrians
   insurgents had disqualified themselves from the protection of the laws
                       of war for exactly this reason:

    "When combatants and non-combatants are practically identical among a
   people, and savage and semi-savage peoples take advantage of this," one
     wrote, "commanders must attack their problems in entirely different
     ways from those in which they proceed against Western peoples." The
   Syrian rebels were "brigands" and brutal thugs, incapable of following
      civilized rules of western warfare. In facing them down, Wright's
   respondent continued, the French should draw on lessons learned by the
      U.S. military in confronting the American Indians during westward
         expansion: "The long list of Indian wars ... bear eloquent
   testimony...to the almost universal brutality of red-skinned fighters.
       With these, there can be little thought of international law."

    This distinction between those qualifying for civilized treatment in
         war and those who did not lay at the center of the imperial
     imagination: the Belgians in the Congo, the British and Germans in
       South Africa, the French in Southeast Asia and Africa, and the
     Americans in the Philippines--all made use of the most destructive
     instruments of warfare against civilian populations. It took Wright
      pages of elaborate legal reasoning to argue (ultimately, in vain)
       against the dominant view that, since the Syrians could not act
   decently in war, the killing of their civilians could not be considered
                            a punishable offense.

    Racial and civilizational hierarchies like these--used to justify the
       targeting of Syrian civilians in the 1920s--no longer exist in
                          international law. [...]

   [30]Blast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2008--Dem Leaders
   Yield Still More on Drilling:

      Hoping to keep moderate members of their party from defecting to
    Republicans, leaders of the House Democrats have surrendered all but
   the last slices of cake when it comes to off-shore drilling for oil and
     gas. Republicans are so gleeful they're practically dancing in the
                                   aisle.

   Which seems odd since the GOP will probably shoot down the legislation
                that includes the relaxed moratorium anyway.

   Many Republicans still seek more Democratic cave-ins on the bill. They
    oppose the inclusion of "use or lose it" provisions that seek to put
    pressure on oil and gas companies to drill on the 68 million acres of
    federal land they already have released but not developed. They also
    have their own version of tax credits and subsidies. In the unlikely
     event the Democratic bill made it through the House, chances are it
    wouldn't become law because of the Senate, which is looking at three
                     major energy proposals of its own.

   multiculturalism chit-chat, Greg Dworkin gave us his round-up,
   including the Putin op-ed in the NYT, the CO recalls, and Republican
   shutdown strategery & the Hastert Rule. A brief look at this intriguing
   find, "Marissa Mayer: 'It's Treason' For Yahoo To Disobey The NSA."
   Hmm! Salon's "The 1 percent's Ivy League loophole." And a return to and
   longer look at "How the cult of shareholder value wrecked American
   business." We tried to squeeze Armando in there for a bit, but the NSA
   wasn't having it.

   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [52]Civil
   Rights, [53]Community, [54]Congress, [55]Culture, [56]Economy,
   [57]Education, [58]Elections, [59]Energy, [60]Environment, [61]Health
   Care, [62]International, [63]Labor, [64]Law, [65]Media, [66]Meta,
   [67]National Security, [68]Science, [69]Transportation, or [70]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([71]California, [72]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       when he was first putting out this work.  But he's a great composer
       and lyricist.  I learned to like his vocals also.  Such an amazing
       collection of great songs he has.
       The first time I heard Hummingbird, maybe 20 years ago, BB King was
       performing it.  I looked at who wrote it and that got me back to
       listening to more of Leon's work.

   My @#$# grant is submitted!!! Finally! Now, to sit back and wait for
   the reviewers to rain down hate and deny funding. :)

   I have just finished working 19 days straight.  All work and no play
   has made me a very dull MAHW (not to mention an uninformed one).
   Corona has seriously never tasted so good.

   So, what did I miss?  Don't tell me about pie fights (unless, of
   course, they were epic and humorous).  I didn't really miss those.

   I have to share this because it's making me smile all over (even more
   than finishing the damned grant):  Tomorrow, the fam and I are heading
   up to Oregon.  My daughter raised a guide dog puppy last year, and he's
   just finished his actual guide dog training and is being placed with
   someone who needs him.  We get to go to his graduation, and my daughter
   will get to hand him off to the person he's being placed with.

       No, fortunately, we only had to pay for his food, for the most
       part.  She raised him as part of a public high school class. She
       did have to take him to all her classes every day so he could
       "learn to be bored,"  which he did very well.  He was an incredibly
       good dog from the get go. Our pet dogs seemed like undisciplined
       goofs in comparison, and I'd always thought they were pretty good.
         Guide Dogs breeds them and sends them off as puppies to be
       raised, trained in basic commands, and exposed to all kinds of
       environments, and to learn how to live non-destructively in a
       house.  The worst thing he ever did was steal the toilet paper and
       run about the house with it streaming behind him.  They have
       evaluators come evaluate the dogs periodically, and when Guide Dogs
       thinks the pup is ready, he's taken back to Oregon to learn actual
       guiding -- that's all Guide Dogs' hard work, and at their expense,
       and I remain in awe that a dog can be trained to guide a blind
       person.

   In my discussions/arguments/flame wars with Ron/Rand Paul fans, I've
   been keeping one argument at bay for now.  But if they start talking
   about impeaching Obama, or on how Obama isn't allowed to condemn the
   use of chemical weapons in Syria because prior administrations had
   looked the other way when they were used, I may bring this out.  (They
   looooove using the word "blowback" without any prescription as to what
   to do from here on out, since we don't have a fucking time machine.)
   I'll ask them if the usage constitutes a war crime, and an impeachable
   offense.

   They'll naturally say yes, at which point I'll ask them why their hero
   Ron Paul NEVER introduced impeachment articles against Ronald Reagan
   when he had EVERY chance to do so in the House after it became very
   much clear he condoned Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran.  Or
   heck, why no impeachment charges for Iran-Contra?

   And with their simplistic "you're either with Ron Paul or you're aiding
   a war criminal" logic, since Paul didn't file impeachment articles,
   therefore ipso facto he also is a war criminal.  :-D  Libertarian
   logic!

   But yeah, I'm saving that one for now.  :-)  I think Stephen Colbert's
   [493]takedown of Rand Paul last night was good enough for now.

   I'll go with Nancy Pelosi on this: Hopefully, when Pres. #Putin says
   "we must not forget that God created us equal" he includes gays and
   lesbians in Russia."

     The division of the world into civilized and uncivilized realms went
     beyond mere matters of doctrine: official legal guides that
     accompanied imperial armies into the colonial theater stipulated
     that intra-European rules of war did not apply in "wars with
     uncivilized States and tribes." Africans, Native Americans, and
     "Asiatic" tribes were all taken to be insufficiently advanced to
     obey civilized conduct in warfare; they could be dealt with as
     brutally as necessary.

   Who decides which peoples are "sufficiently advanced"? -  the ones with
   the bombs it sure looks like

   in 1925 whereupon it's ultimately all the fault of the French and where
   was the peacekeeperless League of Nations?

   I decided to write a diary on the disinformation of Russian messaging
   of the past few days to which I invite you at [605]Russians Faint Over
   North Korea's Zombie Plutonium Reactor

     The mandate region was subdivided into six states. They were the
     states of Damascus (1920), State of Aleppo (1920), Alawite State
     (1920), Jabal Druze (1921), the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta
     (1921) (modern-day Hatay) and the State of Greater Lebanon (1920),
     which became later the modern country of Lebanon....

     In 1925, Syrian resistance to French colonial rule broke out in full
     scale revolt, led by Sultan Pasha el Atrash.

     The revolt broke out in Jabal Druze but quickly spread to other
     Syrian states and became a general rebellion in Syria. France tried
     to retaliate by having the parliament of Aleppo declare secession
     from the union with Damascus, but the voting was foiled by Syrian
     patriots.

     Despite French attempts to maintain control by encouraging sectarian
     divisions and isolating urban and rural areas, the revolt spread
     from the countryside and united Syrian Druze, Sunnis, Shiites,
     Alawis, and Christians. Once the rebel forces had besieged Damascus,
     the French military responded with brutal counter-insurgency
     techniques that prefigured those that would be used later in Algeria
     and Indo-China. These techniques included house demolitions,
     collective punishments of towns, executions, population transfers,
     and the use of heavy armor in urban neighborhoods. The revolt was
     eventually subdued in 1926-27 via French aerial bombardment of
     civilian areas, including Damascus

   and de jure versus de facto distinctions still matter:

     Racial and civilizational hierarchies like these--used to justify
     the targeting of Syrian civilians in the 1920s--no longer exist in
     international law. [...]

   perception:

     "When combatants and non-combatants are practically identical among
     a people, and savage and semi-savage peoples take advantage of
     this," one wrote, "commanders must attack their problems in entirely
     different ways from those in which they proceed against Western
     peoples."

   It's practically the same thing. The Bush administration was simply
   practicing the "civilized" and "savage" world view... including
   torture, murder, disappearances, and black prisons of abuse... much
   like the French in Syria in the 1920s.

     Abel Maldonado's chief strategist, media strategist and campaign
     manager have all left his campaign for governor, the latest in a
     series of setbacks for the Republican former lieutenant governor.

   This was the moderate Republican who traded his vote for a Dem budget
   (back when it took 2/3) for getting "top two" "primaries" on the
   initiative ballot, which passed. (I hate top two because it wrecks the
   way parties work without improving anything, like ranked-choice or
   proportional representation would; it just favors the moderate.) He
   then proceeded to win a "primary" spot and then lose in the "general"
   election last year. Serves him right! Now we're stuck with this stupid
   election system, though, all so that one dude could lose.

   Kinda sad the apparent reason his staff bailed though:

     Davis said Maldonado was resistant to advice from advisers to focus

   imperialism, and its underlying ideology of exceptionalism.  No
   American is fully educated without reading the essay I've linked here.
    No, I'm not pushing some verbose intellectual, probaly European, that
   you are fearing, no Zizek, no Foucault, no Sorel.  This is one of the
   most comfortable and familiar of all American literary voices, Mark
   Twain. If yu never read another essay, if you've never read one at all,
   this is worth your time.  Heads you lose, taels we win.

   [745]To the Person Sitting in Darkness.

     Blessings of Civilization -- for a change, and for the refreshment
     of his spirit -- then go on with our tale:
       "Letters from the Earth" was also very enlightening for me during
       the early family church going teenage years.
       Sort of an invite to question.
