   [29]John Nichols at The Nation writes Obama's Chained-CPI Social
   Security Cut is Smart Politics... For the GOP:

     But Walden is no newcomer to the House, or to high-stakes political
     campaigning.

     He's one of the savviest political players in Congress. A veteran
     state legislator who managed congressional campaigns before his own
     election to the House in 1999, he "gets" how to win elections in
     competitive regions and states. And his fellow Republicans recognize
     this reality: He chaired the House Republican Leadership through
     2010 and, when Republicans retook the chamber that year, he chaired
     the House Majority Transition Committee.

     Walden is now the head of the National Republican Campaign
     Committee, meaning that he is responsible for making sure that
     Republicans hold their House majority in 2014. That explains why
     Walden is ripping the president's decision to go with "Chained-CPI."
     And it explains why austerity opponents are ripping Walden - they
     fear any tears in the fabric of fantasy that suggests only a cuts
     agenda (as opposed to a growth agenda) can balance budget.

   [30]Tim Carpenter and Mike Hersh at In These Times conclude that
   Cutting Social Security is a recipe for social insecurity:

     Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) Co-Chairs Reps. Raúl Grijalva
      and Keith Ellison issued a statement explaining, "One hundred seven
     Members of the House of Representatives, a majority of the
     Democratic Caucus, have already stated our vigorous opposition to
     cutting Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits."
     Progressives in Congress could block the cuts, but it's going to
     take a movement to turn back austerity hysteria.

   [31]Jill Filipovic: at The Guardian writes Why I wish Huma Abedin had
   left Anthony Weiner in the dust:

     But, like feminist writer Katha Pollitt said ,when commenting on a
     different political sex scandal, just once, I'd like to see a
     publicly humiliated political wife give both her man and Tammy
     Wynette the finger and walk away. Even better if she goes full
     flame-thrower on her husband. Air the dirty laundry. Don't just
     refuse to do the smiling couple photo ops; as Pollitt suggests,
     "skip the press conference and fly off to Paris instead". Put the
     trip on his credit card.

     It sounds ugly and uncouth and unladylike, I know. And it is. All
     the more the reason to do it.

   [32]Erika Eichelberger at Mother Jones writes about the The Liberal
   Civil War Over Social Security Cuts:

     Liberals have been fighting the administration on chained CPI before
     it was ever included in the budget. Last year, 107 House Democrats
     signed a letter saying, "Social Security has not contributed to our
     current fiscal problems and it should not be on the bargaining
     table." Another 30 Democrats in the House signed a similar letter.
     In November, over 250 economists and social-insurance experts signed
     a statement opposing the proposal, saying there was "no empirical
     basis for reducing...Social Security" with the chained CPI inflation
     adjustment because the elderly experience a higher rate of inflation
     than the rest of the population.

   [33]Derek Thompson at The Atlantic writes Reality Check: Obama Cuts
   Social Security and Medicare by Much More Than the GOP:

     Have I forgotten about Ryan's Medicare reforms after 2023? Nope. But
     I don't understand why, in 2013, it's considered reasonable, brave,
     or admirable to propose a dramatic and radical Medicare change that
     won't take effect for another ten years. That's seven years after
     Obama has left office. It's not for another two presidential
     election cycles plus another midterm. I'd rather talk about what
     these budget plans for this year, and this decade.

     And here's the bottom line: Obama preserves federal Medicaid
     spending, he doesn't unwind Obamacare, and he spends much more on
     mandatory and non-defense discretionary programs than Ryan proposed.
     But his cuts to Social Security and Medicare combined are somewhere
     between $200 billion and $380 billion deeper than the GOP budget. On
     these programs there is no room to "compromise." The president is
     already to the right of the right.

   [34]Larry Kudlow at NRO writes Obama's Growth-Busting Budget:

     No matter how you slice the Obama budget pie, the inescapable fact
     is that the president wants to get rid of the roughly $1 trillion
     budget-cutting sequester and substitute in a $1 trillion-plus tax
     hike. In other words, more spending, more taxing. Growth-busting.
     The GOP should just say no.

     And let me provide some counsel to my Republican friends in
     Washington, in particular in the House. Balanced budgets don't
     create growth. This mantra is wrong. It's growth that creates
     balanced budgets.

   [35]Paul Krugman at The New York Times writes about bitcoin and
   goldbugs in The Antisocial Network:

     The practical misconception here -- and it's a big one -- is the
     notion that we live in an era of wildly irresponsible money
     printing, with runaway inflation just around the corner. It's true
     that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have greatly
     expanded their balance sheets -- but they've done that explicitly as
     a temporary measure in response to economic crisis. I know,
     government officials are not to be trusted and all that, but the
     truth is that Ben Bernanke's promises that his actions wouldn't be
     inflationary have been vindicated year after year, while goldbugs'
     dire warnings of inflation keep not coming true.

   [36]Owen Jones: at the Independent writes that Our hate figures and
   heroes are mere surfers on the tide of history:

     "We of the older generation may not live to see the decisive battles
     of this coming revolution," declared Vladimir Lenin in January 1917;
     a month later, the Russian Tsar was deposed, and by the end of the
     year the Bolshevik leader would be ruling revolutionary Russia. The
     assassination of Archduke Ferdinand may have been the immediate
     trigger for the First World War; but a Europe divided into two
     hostile camps was a tinderbox that was always going to explode.
     Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela became the figureheads of the
     Indian and South African causes of freedom; but it was the
     involvement of millions in sometimes violent struggles that ensured
     victory.

   [37]E.J. Dionne at the Washington Post writes Newtown's call to reason:

     The truth is that the Newtown slaughter has finally moved the gun
     debate away from irrational emotions, ridiculous assumptions,
     manipulative rhetoric -- and, on the part of politicians,
     debilitating terror at the alleged electoral reach of those who see
     any new gun regulations as a step into totalitarianism. These bills
     are being taken seriously precisely because we are finally putting
     emotion aside. We are riding a wave of reason.

     Reason tells us that those who embrace the old slogan that "guns
     don't kill people, people do" should support background checks
     because their very purpose is to keep guns out of the hands of the
     wrong people, including criminals and those with deep psychological
     disturbances. Reason tells us that mass killers will kill fewer
     people if they cannot buy large magazines and have to keep reloading
     their weapons. Reason tells us that our freedom as Americans does
     not rest on the existence of an armed citizenry.

   [38]Adam Winkler at the New York Daily News writes :

     In the 1990s, when the first background check law was passed, the
     NRA's Wayne LaPierre warned that it was the first step to gun
     confiscation. A statement from the group claimed the feds would "go
     house to house, kicking in the law-abiding gun owners' doors."

     There are 300 million pieces of evidence to prove this prediction
     wrong.
     Today, LaPierre says background checks will lead to a national
     registry of guns, which will be used to confiscate our weapons.
     Federal law, however, explicitly bans the creation of a national gun
     registry.

   [39]Jose Miguel Leyva, at The Progressive writes Immigration reform
   can't come soon enough:

     Fortunately, the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have
     managed to work out at least the trappings of an agreement on a new
     guest worker program. What remains to be seen is if our political
     leaders can do the same, especially while ensuring the guest worker
     program truly provides equal treatment, decent conditions and fair
     pay for workers.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [50]Tagging tips - [51]Search For Tags - [52]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [53]Civil
   Rights, [54]Community, [55]Congress, [56]Culture, [57]Economy,
   [58]Education, [59]Elections, [60]Energy, [61]Environment, [62]Health
   Care, [63]International, [64]Labor, [65]Law, [66]Media, [67]Meta,
   [68]National Security, [69]Science, [70]Transportation, or [71]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([72]California, [73]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       ...Walden would have kept his mouth shut.
       That's a very interesting [157]article I hadn't seen before:

     Republicans have to choose between raising taxes in order to get the
     Chained CPI, arguing for Chained CPI without the tax increase, or
     rejecting Chained CPI.
       This, by the way, is more or less the thinking of Ezra Klein and
       Greg Sagrent, whose analyses I trust.
       So amidst all the whinging and handwringing, could someone please
       tell me how exactly Chained CPI becomes law? Who votes for this?
       I repeatedly claimed that Obama would never propose cuts to social
       security. I was wrong. Then again, I also claimed, repeatedly, that
       Rick Perry would win the 2012 Election, and that The Supreme Court
       would overturn Health Care Reform.

 About Weiner, not about his wife ([378]0+ / 0-)
       I haven't seen anyone else say this at dKos about Anthony Weiner's
       very own, personal, Weiner-for-Mayor boomlet: The only reason he
       can dream that he could even be nominated, much less elected, Mayor
       of NYC is because he's Jewish.
       Christine Quinn is a red-headed Irishwomen. Bill Thompson is black.
       John Liu is Chinese. Bill de Blasio is Italian. There's not a
       Jewish candidate in the field, and Weiner seems to think that the
       ethnic factors work to his advantage, enuff to overcome the naughty
       stupid stuff.
       I'm worried that being the Jewish candidate might not be enuff,
       considering the baggage, and a desperate man might seek to become
       the white candidate, especially if Bill Thompson makes the run-off.
       That would be terrible for the city.
       As a gentile, I've voted for Jewish candidates here in NYC many,
       many times. But I surely will vote for any of the other candidates
       against Anthony Weiner.

 The problems with chained CPI ([427]13+ / 0-)

                [438]emmasnacker, [439]FogCityJohn, [440]DSPS owl

       So, CPI (consumer price index) gets calculated on the basis of a
       bundle of goods from the economy.  When the goods in the bundle go
       up in price, the CPI will rise as well.
       What chained CPI does is factor in a substitution effect.  Chained
       CPI says that if the price of beef goes up relative to chicken, you
       will start eating less beef and more chicken.  (This, of course,
       assumes that they are perfectly exchangeable, ignoring taste and
       potential allergies, etc).  Then, if the price of chicken goes up,
       chained CPI will assume that you'll eat less chicken and more of
       something else, maybe tuna, for instance.  And this continues and
       uses the new normal as the basis each time.  As a result of this,
       the Simpson-Bowles Commission got the nickname of the "catfood
       commission."  If chicken rises too much in price, I guess grandma
       has to eat catfood.
       I would argue that chained CPI has problems with the general
       population, but it is even more problematic for the elderly.
       Seniors spend a disproportionately large share of their income on
       housing and health care, neither of which work on a basis of
       substitution. As Rep. Pete DeFazio once commented, if a triple
       bypass is too expensive, we can't tell you to get a hernia
       operation instead.

 In life, I do eat more chicken as the price of ([444]0+ / 0-)
       beef goes up, so that doesn't bother me.
       An earlier question, though, seems far more relevant: Are the costs
       of seniors properly reflected in a CPI geared to the populace at
       large.
       I don't quite get the comment about seniors' higher exposure to
       medical costs -- Medicare should actually result in a lower
       exposure -- but seniors do have different overall needs from young
       people.
       That would seem to argue for a special Seniors' market basket if
       CPI is to be used for SS adjustments, chained or otherwise.

       Two relevant points, I thought:
       1. A cost of living adjustment should reflect the cost of living
       for seniors.  if that requires a special senior index, then we
       should use a special senior index.
       2. Monkeying around with the numbers for budgetary considerations
       is the wrong way to go.  We should use the approach that best
       represents the cost of living as seniors face it.  COLA should
       represent neither a gain nor a loss.  If somebody wants to
       increase/decrease benefits, that's exactly what they should do --
       increase or decrease benefits.  The fact that something is a
       poltiical hot potato is a reason NOT to get slippery under the
       covers.

       that tax cuts pay for themselves through increased growth and don't
       worry about the fiscal ramifications.
       Of course, what happens is that the tax cuts never pay for
       themselves and you end up shrinking government even further to try
       to dig out of the hole you put yourself in.

       But I also think GOP turnout will be down in the districts we need
       to win. The question is going to be Dem turnout. Of course liberals
       & black voters will turn out, they always do. Theres just not
       enough of them in the right places to win. The key question will be
       the new Obama demographics. Will it be 2010 or robust? Time will
       tell.
       I do know that attacking Social Security is most definitely a
       turnout depressor since the polls show the public is overwhelmingly
       against that, across all demographics and ideologies excepting the

       teaser "[576]Eggs! Sperm! To divert everyone from guns, guns.
       The reality for a person needing a test for genetically linked
       breast cancer, from "[577]The Supreme Court should invalidate the
       patent on human DNA":

     The case involves Myriad Genetics, which received patents in the
     1990s for the exclusive right to examine any isolated DNA that
     contains the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Most people have normal versions
     of these genes, but those who carry mutations of BRCA usually have
     an 85 to 90 percent risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer.
     Doctors cannot independently look at the genetic code in a person's
     BRCA genes, because as soon as blood is drawn and DNA is isolated to
     examine those genes, it is immediately the legal property of Myriad
     Genetics. . . Because of Myriad's patents, any American who wants to
     have his or her DNA tested for the potentially life-threatening BRCA
     mutations has to use the services of Myriad Genetics. There is no
     possibility of an independent test. Myriad charges about $3,000 for
     the testing, but hundreds of clinical laboratories nationwide could
     do it for less than $200.
       This is but one example in which neglected practical aspects of
       modern life harm the public while the Republicans war with
       themselves and Democrats watch the duel all while nattering on
       about grand theories of government.

 The Republicans are already ([606]0+ / 0-)
       walking away from Obama's budget, I'm beginning to wonder if
       Boehner dares to even hold a vote on it.

     Another bluff was that Obama would never actually agree to cut
     Medicare and Social Security -- that he was as intransigent on
     spending as the GOP is on taxes. When the Wall Street Journal asked
     Mitch McConnell what he'd need to move on taxes, he said "higher
     Medicare premiums for the wealthy, an increase in the Medicare
     eligibility age and slowing cost-of-living increases for Social
     Security." For the first time, two of those three are in the
     president's budget.
     So is McConnell celebrating? Not quite. "It's quite similar,
     frankly, to his budget last year, and it's two months late," he said
     on Tuesday. "We're not sure this is a serious exercise."

       if the House even holds a vote on it.
       With almost $600 billion in new taxes attached to the chained CPI,
       plus more money for education, less money to the Pentagon, cutting
       direct cash payments to farmers, along with some subsidies,
       increasing funding for the EPA and increases in funding for Dept.
       of Labor, HUD, etc., there's no way the Republicans will vote for

     Even if President Obama had submitted his budget to Congress on time

     increases spending, increases the debt, and NEVER BALANCES.

   It is not unusual for a failure in marriage to be due to the actions of

   It is a stupid and sexist assumption that such problems are  invariably
   due only to a rotten, horndog of a  not-yet-civilized-by-a-woman
   husband, and an innocent, put-upon, chaste bride-victim.

   First of all, some wives of political men involved in sex scandals do
   walk away.  Jenny Sanford comes to mind, as does Dina McGreevey of New
   Jersey. Dina even wrote a book about it.

   But these women did not run for office, and except for agreeing to go
   along for the ride when their husband ran for office are not public
   figures.  They don't always have the urge to be in politics, to have
   their lives examined, to air their dirty laundry.

   Thousands upon thousands of men and women deal with cheating spouses
   every year, and some end the relationship while others try to salvage
   it.  Some will air all their grievances publicly in court, in church,
   in group therapy, in a bar, wherever.  Others do not.

   But it's a personal problem, and a personal decision how to respond.
   If they love their spouse, or feel it's better for the kids or themself
   to stay together, that's their choice.  It's a private situation, and
   each person and each relationship is different.

   Myself, I don't see that we have the right to want them to act
   differently than they see is the best for themself.  They've already
   been harmed, and now Ms. Filipovic is trying to make them feel bad
   because they didn't act in a way she thinks is fitting from the
   outside?  I don't think so.

 11th dementional liar ([730]0+ / 0-)

   Wait until Obama decides to leave the DC bubble and face the wrath of
   wee the peons. The worst decision by a democratic president in my
   lifetime. Destroy SS in order to save it. To appease 400 fat cat
   congress people he really really pissed off 66 million Americans who
   voted for this sorry leader.

 Huma is not the problem here ([733]0+ / 0-)

   Anthony Weiner is the sexually infantile twerp who engages in digital
   flashing. He's solely responsible for his behavior.

   May see something in Anthony Weiner that the columnists do not.

   I am not religious, and did NOT say I enjoyed sects.

 Maybe Jill Filipovic should STFU.... ([739]0+ / 0-)

   ....and let other people worry about their own relationships.
