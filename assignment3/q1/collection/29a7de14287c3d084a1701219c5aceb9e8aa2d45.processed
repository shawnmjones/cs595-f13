   From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE...

   Late night snark may be sinful. But who am I to judge?

     "Sunday, on his way home from Brazil, Pope Francis said it was not
     his job to judge gays. He said that's what the Tony Awards are for."
     ---Jay Leno

   Chamber (empty) of the U.S. House
   America's national morgue
   -
   -

     "Okay, let's just be honest now. The House is clearly where things
     go to die. It's where parents are going to start telling their kids
     their aging pets went. 'Oh, Fluffy's fine, darling. She just got
     stuck in committee.'"
     ---John Oliver
     -
     "Today Illinois became the 20th state to legalize marijuana. The
     state also changed its name to Chillinois."
     ---Conan O'Brien
     -
     "CNN is offering Do's and Don'ts for summertime sex. First Don't:
     watch CNN."
     ---Stephen Colbert
     -
     "Anthony Weiner's campaign manager quit. He says he's applying for a
     much less stressful job that has a better chance of success. He's
     trying to get Paula Deen elected president of BET."
     ---Craig Ferguson
     -
     "Some jackass vandalized the Lincoln Memorial. Who hates the Lincoln
     Memorial? Democrats love it because it honors the man who freed the
     slaves. And Republicans love it because it just sits there and does
     nothing. If it could cry and chain smoke, it would be John Boehner."
     ---Bill Maher

   And a quick reminder: The Netroots Nation team is now accepting
   submissions for their annual auction, which starts August 15th. Please
   go through your prized possessions and donate one or more by
   [29]clicking on this here link. Or you can also [30]click on this here
   link instead, but they're both the same link so take your pick. We're
   all about options here.

   Okay then. Your west coast-friendly edition of  Cheers and Jeers starts
   below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!]

   Cheers and Jeers for Friday, August 2, 2013

   Note: Whoever can guess what the mystery meat is in the C&J cafeteria
   tonight by taste alone gets a free ride to the ER.  ---Chef Jeff

   Employment graph updated for July, 2013 numbers. &nbsp;162,000
   jobs...7.4% unemployment rate.
   -
   CHEERS and JEERS to two sides of the same employment report.  The July
   numbers from the Bureau of Workin' Stiffs [35]came out this morning.
   Our side proclaims, "162,000 thousand new jobs!  Three years of
   uninterrupted job growth!  The unemployment rate dropped to 7.4
   percent!  Without the Republican sequester the numbers would be
   better!"  The other side snarls, "Previous unemployment reports were
   revised down!  Unemployment still sucks at 7.4 percent!  Without the
   Democratic sequester the numbers would be better!"  But at least both
   sides agree: "At least we ain't Yurp!"  Kum By yah, yo.

   CHEERS to the Old Man.  On Sunday's date 52 years ago:

     Mr. and Mrs. Barack H. Obama
     6085 Kalanianaole Hwy., son, Aug. 4
     ---[36]Honolulu Advertiser, 1961

   Remember during the '08 campaign when the traditional media tried
   spinning the line that Obama was too young and wet-behind-the-huge-ears
   to be president?  I laughed, knowing that his accomplished POTUSmates
   in the 40-something club [37]include Teddy Roosevelt, James K. Polk,
   John F. Kennedy, and Bill Clinton. (Pay no attention to the inept drunk
   Franklin Pierce behind the curtain.)  Besides, a quick check of the
   highlights of his birth year, 1961, is enough to make your bones feel a
   bit creaky:
   Barack Obama as a child on a tricycle It ain't the years, kid.
   It's the mileage.

     > None of the James Bond movies had been released
     > West Side Story won the Oscar for Best Picture
     > John F. Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president---Obama is #44
     > The Dow Jones Industrials reached a high of...734!!!
     > Median price of a new home: $17,200
     > Harper Lee won a Pulitzer for To Kill A Mockingbird
     > Elvis's Blue Hawaii started its 20-week run at the top of the
     charts.
     > The price of a gallon of gas was 31 cents.
     > Sun Myung Moon could only scrounge up 36 couples to mass-marry.

   Certain policy and strategy differences aside (Summers at the fed?
   Really???), I really like the ever-optimistic Obama, and I'm ready to
   be adopted as soon as the First Family submits the paperwork.  So Happy
   52nd Birthday two days early, Mr. President...and many blessings on
   your camels.

   JEERS to getting picked over.  Yesterday we were whisked by a taxi with
   no shocks to our dentist in a non-descript dungeon room.  The hygienist
   stuck a grappling hook into my gums and followed up with a miniature
   sandblaster that made the same screeching sound as nails on a
   chalkboard and made my gums bleed.  Then she took pictures of my
   bleeding gums and displayed them on an IMAX screen that was simulcast
   in the parking lot.  Then the dentist came in and was told: "I'm
   concerned---his gums are bleeding."  Well, thank you Florence Fucking
   Nightingale.  Final verdict: I need crowns, a night guard, more
   periodontal sandblasting, a plutonium-powered toothbrush that weighs
   six pounds, and $500 for damaging their grappling hook.  Or as my
   dentist said under his breath: "I need a new Mercedes."
   Woman dancing with the devil
   Republicans in the
   NC House celebrate.
   -
   JEERS to a twisted orgy of madness.  After running their majority
   steamroller over women's rights, voter rights, students, minorities,
   the unemployed, the sick and, for good measure, the state's justice
   system, North Carolina Republicans celebrated [38]by dancing a jig on
   the House floor.  From The National Memo (aka the LOLGOP folks on
   twitter):

     "It was the final death knell to the progress made by years of
     social justice and civil rights advancements," writes SadTimesinNC,
     who posted the video filmed by Carol Edward on CNN's iReport.
     Republicans have turned North Carolina into a laughingstock and
     they're dancing for joy.

   They'll spend their recess kicking puppies, stealing candy from babies
   and short-sheeting the beds down at the nursing home.  Just to keep in
   practice until the next session.

   CHEERS to a class act.  Happy birthday to Peter O'Toole, who turns 81
   today.  I was bummed when he announced his retirement from acting last
   year, but he sure leaves behind a wealth of performances that never
   fail to mesmerize.  And extra mojo for being able to make me laugh
   without even getting out of his chair:

   IFRAME: [39]http://www.youtube.com/embed/FaxjpQARxWo

   In the DVD player this weekend: his performance as a litigant in the
   famous Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Arabia.  (The scene where he
   charges at Scalia on camelback is priceless.)
   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) holds the gavel during the final session
   of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina
   September 6, 2012. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;REUTERS/Jason Reed (UNITED
   STATES &nbsp;- Tags: POLITICS ELECTIONS TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY)
   Barney Frank, seen here holding John
   Boehner's teeny tiny gavel, joins Bill
   Maher on HBO's Real Time tonight.
   -
   CHEERS to home vegetation.  If you're planning to couch surf this
   weekend, here are some suggestions from your humble online servant.
   (It's me! Billy!)  On HBO's [40]Real Time, Bill Maher gets in one more
   show before his mid-season break---he's joined by Barney Frank, Josh
   Barro, Jay Z, comedian Larry Miller, and Alexis Goldstein of The
   Nation.  New DVD releases include the sequel to the
   better-than-expected G.I. Joe.  The baseball schedule [41]is here.
   (The Red Sox will de-fang the Diamondbacks Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!)  On [42]60
   Minutes: counterinsurgency tactics and the relief ship Africa Mercy.
   And the weekend wraps up with HBO's The Newsroom, (which I'm happy to
   say is zippier and more newsroomier in its second season), but not
   before The Discovery Channel kicks off...wait for it...[43]SHARK WEEK
   CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH!!!

   And here's your Sunday morning lineup, now with C&J's EXCLUSIVE "Fresh
   Face Index."  Let's see if the producers made any bold and daring
   booking choices this week:

     Meet the Press: Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA);
     Rudy Giuliani; Dan Balz of The Washington Post hawks a book about
     the 2012 election.  Fresh Face Index: 0

     This Week: Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey; roundtable
     with Matt Dowd, George Will, Jeff Zeleny, Soledad O'Brien, Neera
     Tanden.  Fresh Face Index: 0

     Face the Nation: Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY); world's fastest marathon
     runner and clean dish cleaner Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI); roundtable with
     Peggy Noonan, David Sanger (NYT), Dan Balz (WaPo), Barton Gellman
     (WaPo) and John Dickerson (CBS).  Fresh Face Index: 0

     CNN's State of the Union: Sarah Thomas, who may become the NFL's
     first female officiating referee.  Fresh Face Index: 1 (Thomas)

     Fox GOP Talking Points Sunday: Former CIA director General Michael
     Hayden (who, we hear, sleeps in four-star jammies); Rep. Justin
     Amash (R-MI); House majority leader Eric Cantor (R-VA); roundtable
     with Juan Williams, Jim DeMint, Howard Kurtz and Bill Kristol.
     Fresh Face Index: 1 (Amash's criticism of the NSA is refreshing.)

   Fresh Face Index for all five shows: 2.  But plenty of rotten faces,
   so, hey, it all works out.  Happy viewing!

   Five years ago in C&J: August 2, 2008

   JEERS to that wretched stench.  Yesterday George W. Bush flew into
   southern Maine for a visit to Mummy and Daddy's Kennebunkport compound.
    Almost immediately after he arrived, the area was hit by a major storm
   with deadly lightning, thunder, hailstones, flooding and 60mph winds.
   Gee, I didn't know he was bringing Cheney with him.

   -

   And just one more...

   CHEERS to the birth of a legend.  And here we are in August, 2013.
   Afghanistan?  Clusterfuck.  Economy?  Clusterfuck.  Energy policy,
   immigration reform, unemployment, personal income, retirement plans?
   Still a cluster-you-know-what.  Well, I have something to snap us out
   of them clusterfuck blues.  Thanks to wayback-machine technology, we
   take you to tomorrow's date in 2006, when life was simple, cherub-faced
   children played stickball in the streets, and Daddy came home to find
   his slippers, pipe, newspaper and supper waiting for him as the aroma
   of jasmine wafted on the warm summer breeze. Oh, and [44]this was at
   the top of the DKos charts:
   Angry guy
   ErrinF?
   (Artist's rendering)

     Since I can't delete my account myself, my only recourse is to be as
     abrasive and disruptive as I can be UNTIL MY ACCOUNT GETS DELETED.
     As long as my account remains here, I do not feel comfortable
     leaving. Is it really such a tough request to delete my account so I
     can go? Just what kind of website lets you join up but won't let you
     leave? One that regards people as little more than statistics,
     that's what. How like the Democratic Party for Kos to view his
     site's members as little more than statistics.

     DELETE MY FUCKING ACCOUNT, KOS.

   And, for a brief moment, unicorns romp once again in the Fields of
   Orange.

   Have a great weekend!  Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering
   about today?

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [58]Tagging tips - [59]Search For Tags - [60]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [61]Civil
   Rights, [62]Community, [63]Congress, [64]Culture, [65]Economy,
   [66]Education, [67]Elections, [68]Energy, [69]Environment, [70]Health
   Care, [71]International, [72]Labor, [73]Law, [74]Media, [75]Meta,
   [76]National Security, [77]Science, [78]Transportation, or [79]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([80]California, [81]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.
   You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it:

   everyone MUST see [996]20 Feet from Stardom.  One of the high points of
   the film is when they isolate Merry Clayton's phenomenal vocal track on
   Gimme Shelter, which is even more bloodcurdling without the guitars and

   Without her the song would still have been great, but it is her backup
   vocals that make the song reach down and grab you in the gut

 Why treat him like a talking dog? ([1022]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:

   All the applause the Pope is getting for arriving at a place that many
   Protestant and Jewish denominations have been for decades makes me
   think of the story of the New York City Marathon, about a decade ago,
   of a person with disabilities who kept on running through the night and
   finally reaching the finish line in some 23 hours.

   Why be so indulgent???? Why treat him like the only religious leader in
   the world???

   The furor over Friday's [10.5] job report revealed a political movement
   that is rooting for American failure, so obsessed with taking down
   Obama that good news drives its members into a blind rage. -Paul

       he is the "voice" of the religion. No one Lutheran speaks for all
       Lutherans or Episcopaleans or Baptists. No one Jew speaks for all
       Jews. As you point out, denominations have come to the 21st century
       (and quite a few did it last century), but not all have.
       But when the Pope does something it has gravitas. He's certainly
       not the only religious leader in the world, but he speaks from a
       position of authority that few, if any, have.
       I guess the Seer/Prophet of the Mormons would be similar. He can
       make pronouncements (like allowing blacks in the Mormon church)
       that change the religion.
       Of course the Mormons are still living in the 19th century when it
       comes to gays.

       I think that argument runs the risk of enabling a monopolistic
       mindset.
       After posting this, I realized that someone could say that they
       voted for the Pope because it would be like a home team going from
       constantly losing to playing at the .500 level. To those people, I
       apologize for any harshness.

       Yes, you ought to be worried. As people begin to starve and drown

       those who produce CO2. They may be poor, but they lack Fox News to

   Jeers to dealing with bureaucracy today.  Don't get me started.

   Cheers to John Oliver, who is doing a fantastic job subbing for Jon
   Stewart on the Daily Show.  I hope they're grooming him for his own
   show; Comedy Central could use another show that isn't "random dude
   says offensive stuff and smirks about how offensive he is."

   Jeers to sneaky pooties.  I don't know how Slippers (my tux boy) knew
   today was V-E-T day, but he found a new hiding place and didn't come
   out until we canceled the appointment.  (And when he did come out, we
   stuffed him into a carrier and dragged him down there.  Verdict:  he's
   perfectly healthy, but bad for our mental health.  At least he didn't
   arrange for a car accident like he did last time I took him.)

   Cheers to Keith Ellison, singing "This Land Is Your Land" to celebrate
   the arrival of same-sex marriage in Minnesota.

   Jeers that the promised destruction of heterosexual marriage has not
   yet arrived.  What's up with that?

   Cheers to reading Jane Austen, a woman of sense and sensibility.

   The Daily Show audience doesn't always recognize the occasionally quick

   That's why it's so helpful to view the show on hulu and listen to the

   if they don't give him a show of his own, maybe he can be the regular
   sub for TDS.

   The beauty of TDS is the writers, but you have to have someone at the
   desk who can sell the material, and John Oliver is doing a thousand
   times better than I expected he would.

   What kind of show could he do, though?  A Brit's Eye View of the News?

   BTW, I too am sick of the Jeselnik Offensive and Tosh.0 concept, but I
   guess there is a certain demographic that likes those shows.

       Matt Bevin wins the primary.  McConnell tries to run a write in

       of the vote.

   normally it wouldn't be.  But I have no energy -- feels as if I have
   had flu for a week, but it is just no thyroid hormone left in me.  I am
   going to see a friend and her daughter in St. Louis because I will be
   too radioactive next week to attend her bat mitzvah next week.  I am
   disappointed, but we will all be happier with me staying home.

   Cheers to the friend who is taking my cats for the week, to the other
   one who is driving me to the hospital and driving me home (it is an
   overnight trip), to the others who have offered all sorts of
   assistance, to the boss who says take the days off if you need to when
   the school year starts up next week, and to everyone who has been so
   supportive on line and in person.  I am very lucky to have such
   wonderful friends.

   I am hoping to start up teachers' lounge again in another week.  That
   marks the beginning of the academic year for me.  That and back to
   school sales with backpacks and crayon packs.  How about you?

       In addition to everything else, I am very fortunate to live where I
       am; we are a small town where we know each other, and where the
       majority of the faculty live within walking (or biking) distance of
       the university, and thus within that distance of each other.  If I
       need things from the farmers' market next week people will pick it
       up for me.  I am thinking of asking the guy from whom I get my CSA
       stuff to put together a selection and drop them off on my back
       porch when he comes in or leaves town.  We do these things for each
       other.  I am glad to be a part of such a great community.  Even
       people who have left us for better-paying, better-situated jobs (in
       places that acknowledge gay marriage, cities where there is more
       than one movie theatre and an organic grocery store or an Indian
       restaurant, etc.), miss having the people here.  I am very lucky.

       pathetically thin on the top of my head.  My husband (saint that he
       is) arranged for his hairdresser/barber for come to our place and
       cut my hair.  Interestingly, after she cut my hair, it turned out I
       had a lot of short hair growing in underneath.  My hair is still
       thin but much more respectable than when it was dyed, despite so
       much exposed gray.

   had gone wrong with my maroon hair, and to turn it back to its normal
   brown.

   Cheers to my boss, who solved the payroll problem, is overnighting a
   check to those of us who did everything right and didn't get paid
   anyway, and is now off on vacation.  And then I'm on vacation.

   And cheers to Mr. escapee, who will make a new grill for the driveway

       into a sickly lime.
       Oh, I forgot a jeer.  Jeers to the University of Delaware.  They
       say 72,000 employee, retiree and student records, including SSNs,
       were 'compromised', and are offering free security monitoring and a
       halfhearted apology.
       Two things: my friend who still works there says it's everyone she
       knows.  My suspicion is it's everyone.
       I already pay for security monitoring since my debit card was

   ...... and finally, for a song of the week
   .......................................... if you ask people about
   their favorite New Jersey rock band: most will respond with the E
   Street Band or Bon Jovi .. and a few may reply Southside Johnny or the
   Four Seasons (especially after "Jersey Boys"). But my choice is the
   power-pop band [2803]The Smithereens - not exactly my style of music,
   but a band whose sound and songs speak to me in a personal way more
   than any of their better-known compatriots. And their ability to
   persevere against the tide of music industry trends speaks well of
   their love for the music.

   Their story begins with a tale some of you may have experienced: a
   chance encounter between two Carteret High School classmates over a
   rock magazine photo. Guitarist [2804]Jim Babjak - who had been in two
   bands previously and was losing interest - had a photo of The Who's
   Pete Townshend from "Hit Parader" magazine in the early 1970's.
   [2805]Dennis Diken commented on the photo and the two began a
   friendship, with Diken (on drums) joining Babjak as a duet. They
   eventually added another classmate (Mike Mesaros) on bass and performed
   together, but felt something was missing.

   That something came in the form of someone living 25 miles away:
   singer/songwriter [2806]Pat DiNizio of Scotch Plains. He placed a 1980
   ad in a music paper seeking musicians influenced by "Buddy Holly, Nick
   Lowe, Elvis Costello and the Clash". And they chose their name after
   [2807]Yosemite Sam always threatening to blow someone to "smithereens".

   They performed valiantly at places such as Kenny's Castaway's in
   Greenwich Village (and when that venue closed in 2012, they were the
   [2808]final act to perform there). But back-in-the-day: after six years
   of relentless touring (including opening up for Otis Blackwell) and
   with each member circa age 30: they were considering doing something
   else; DiNizio's family, for example, could offer employment in the
   garbage-hauling business. And then fate intervened again: a tape wound
   its way to Enigma Records, who signed the band. Thus began a six-year
   rise: perhaps not to stardom, but at least success. Their Don
   Dixon-produced album [2809]Especially for You featured their mix of
   British Invasion guitars and pop melodies.

   Pat DiNizio's brooding lyrics - on a tune such as [2810]Behind the Wall
   of Sleep - helped the band to a major deal with Capitol Records after
   the album reached #51 in the charts. And having famed New York DJ
   [2811]Scott Muni in your corner helped, as well. The 1988 next album
   [2812]Green Thoughts became a favorite at college radio stations, ....
   with the song [2813]Only a Memory reaching #92 on the pop charts.
   Demonstrating their affinity for pop culture, the next album title of
   [2814]11 in 1989 represents - depending upon whom you talk to -  either
   Spinal Tap (turn the amps up to "11") or the original "Oceans Eleven"
   film (or both).

   Their decision to drop producer Don Dixon in favor of a heavier sound
   from Ed Stasium helped generate their best-selling single: [2815]A Girl
   Like You - with the Go-Go's Belinda Carlisle on backing vocal - and
   which led to a 1990 [2816]Saturday Night Live appearance.

   But others felt their power-pop sound had been compromised, and the
   album didn't sell as well. Then the 1991 follow-up release [2817]Blow
   Up had the misfortune to come out after Nirvana's "Nevermind" .... and
   the entire grunge movement ate into the Smithereen's audience big time.

   From then, they've not enjoyed big success - and have taken time off
   periodically to live - but have a devoted following larger than a
   "cult" status (especially on the East Coast). They've recorded tribute
   albums to some of their influences: [2818]Meet the Smithereens in honor
   of The Beatles, and [2819]Tommy as a nod to The Who. There is also a
   [2820]Best of album that is an excellent place for anyone discovering
   their music to begin.

   In recent years: Pat DiNizio joined Ross Perot's Freedom Party and made
   a quixotic bid for the [2821]US Senate in 2000 from New Jersey. Bassist
   [2822]Mike Mesaros (far-left in 1st photo below) left the band in 2006
   after becoming the father of two kids, and was replaced by bassist
   [2823]Severo Jornacion (far-right in 2nd photo below). The band's most
   recent album from 2011 is named, appropriately enough ... [2824]2011
   ...... with all new, original material.

   Above all, [2825]The Smithereens are devoted to their fans. As Pat
   DiNizio says of people attending their shows, "They're looking into a
   mirror seeing what they might have done - we look like them, act like
   them and talk like them".

   The Smithereens celebrated their 30th anniversary last year, and begin
   their [2826]latest tour with some West Coast shows (beginning with a
   show in [2827]San Francisco this coming Friday.

     [2828][Smithy4_zps6ecb864a.jpg]    [2829] [Smithy2_zpsb692c119.jpg]

   Just as The Doors' third album was entitled [2830]Waiting for the Sun
   but the title track did not appear on album until two years later: my
   favorite Smithereens tune is [2831]Especially for You - which was the
   name of their debut album but did not appear until their third album. A
   more mellow ballad than much of their material, it still has the
   trademark DiNizio brooding lyrics - and [2832]below you can listen to
   it.

     I've been trying to build a bridge
     to get you for so many years
     Now it looks like it'll have
     to be a dam, to hold back the tears

     You won't make me cry
     My heart won't break in two
     My love is especially for you

     It's the same every night
     When I turn out the lights
     And I'm hugging my pillow instead of you
     In the morning I rise
     And I tell myself lies
     And pretend that I'm happy in spite of you

   Cheers to camping in the woods, with nobody else around. Cheers to

   Cheers to cool mornings (45 degrees at sunrise today).

   But jeers to hornets and yellow jackets. There has been a population
   explosion in Idaho this year. In four days, I have had two close
   encounters with yellow jacket nests. They haven't gotten me yet, but
   it's a matter of time.

   Cheers and a great weekend to everyone.

       It seemed to me that we had waaay more wasps and yellow jackets
       than usual out here in Oregon this year.  And they are already
       ill-tempered and aggressive.  They typically aren't like that until
       mid-September (or late, late August at the earliest).
       My mother in law swears that if you stick a dryer sheet in the
       collar of your shirt they will leave you alone.  I think when they
       see you with that arrangement, they are just laughing too hard at
       you to bite/sting you.

   Cheers to rain clearing off and leaving us a day that was just right -
   mid-70's, blue sky, puffy clouds, clean air. Sure feels great after
   some of the other stuff we've had this summer!

   Cheers to mushroom season! Cheers to chanterelle pie for lunch!

   Out in my garden last night just before dark, however, gave a new
   meaning to the word "slugfest." Jeers to slugs chowing down on what I
   am growing - some crops are gone before I can get any myself. (Alas,
   poor chard!)

   Cheers to daikon, which grows faster than the slugs want to eat it.
   Cheers to the first of the summer stirfry with homegrown daikon this
   week.

   Cheers to my wonderful partner who cooks up a storm in the kitchen -
   and musically too.

   Cheers to everyone here! May all be happy and have wonderful things to
   eat!

   that Pres. Obama has started to focus on jobs.  As though he's been
   ignoring jobs up 'till now.

   I wish the media could look back at previous recoveries from recessions
   since about 1980 and compare government spending then and now.  They
   might find a disconcerting correlation between increase in government
   spending and the pace of recovery.  Hint:  not a negative correlation.

   there was no NASA thing to vote on, Neil Gaiman didn't do anything
   other that just be his regularly awesome self, Patrick Rothfuss still
   hasn't finished that 3rd book......

   So, I have a diary up about [3527]AIDS Walk Austin, if you want to look
   at it. There is -- don't be too stunned -- a U2 video in it. (despite
   looking for, copying & posting that song in my diary this morning, my
   earworm all day has been Lips Like Sugar - what is up with that?)

   I have a question for people who travel. Do they expect single people
   not to travel? I've looked at some stuff (my 50th is in January,
   thinking about doing something neat for that), and everything is double
   occupancy. There was a great deal on Groupon for a trip to Ireland --
   but you had to buy 2. I'm just me, but I could want to go somewhere. Do
   we know any travel agents?

   CHEERS that Joe dodged a bullet. He has been on an antibiotic for
   months, to avoid his 9th ER visit (and hospitalization). He wasn't
   feeling too good yesterday, and shortly after eating just a little
   supper, he started throwing up. Of course, Belle was outta here,
   hitting her pet door at top speed. When he quit upchucking, I took his
   temperature and it was 101. I put an ice pack on the back of his neck,
   and took his temp again in half an hour. It was still 101. At that
   point I alerted Joan. While she was on her way over I got him to drink
   some water and take a Tylenol. He held the water and pill down, which
   he hasn't been able to do in the past.  I waited half an hour, took his
   temp again and it was 99.5. Meanwhile, I got all the stuff together
   that would be needed for the EMTs and subsequent ambulance ride to St.
   Luke's hospital, and charged up my Kindle (average time in ER is 6 1/2
   hours). Joe, unlike other in episodes, stayed alert, was just weak.
   Joan and I watched him for a couple of hours, and his temp stayed near
   99. Finally we helped him get up, and she supported him as he walked to
   his bathroom to get ready for bed. He had had more water meanwhile,
   keeping it down. I helped him get changed for bed, and hung on to his
   pjs as he trundled his walker to bed. Then, I sent Joan home, telling
   her I would call in the morning, whether he was in the hospital or not.
   I had worked outside pruning all am, and was pooped. I dropped off to
   sleep quickly, and when I checked on Joe this am his fever was gone.
   Whew! So,

   CHEERS to breaking the pattern.

   CHEERS too for Joe's "youngest" older sister, who will be 91 on Sunday.
   We are all going to Jerome to see her, including son Bill and our two
   little dogs., Madam Belle and Annie banany. Eileen would have been
   terribly disappointed if we couldn't make the 2 hour plus drive. She is
   the only one living independently. Joe's "oldest" remaining sister (95
   the first of September) is in a care center in Jerome, so we will see
   her too. He has one other older sister (there were five, and he is 8
   years younger than the youngest girl, and only boy) who lives in the
   Bay Area, who just turned 93. Tough old girls. His mother lived to be
   one day short of her 99th b-day. Strong genes, there. And,

   CHEERS to all of you. Stay strong, stay weird, and don't forget to
   write. Love, mcmom

   [3687]Six Ducklings Saved
   DNR rescues six ducklings from storm drain in most heartwarming story
   of the day
   On Saturday night, passengers taking the light rail downtown happened
   upon a strange sight: A mama duck circling the storm drain in distress.
   A short investigation explained why: her six ducklings had fallen
   between the cracks and were trapped underground.
   Some compassionate passerby called the police, who referred the case to
   the Department of Natural Resources.
   The DNR not only retrieved the ducklings, but left a note to reassure
   all the concerned witnesses who had seen the poor mother and worried if
   the family would be reunited.

   "The six ducklings trapped in the sewer were rescued!!" the sign reads.

   Jeers to death. I lost my mother to cancer yesterday. She beat lung
   cancer in 1998, but liver cancer at 88 years of age...Cheers to her
   long, fruitful Life, her youthful exuberance, her sense of humor and
   the fact that she never, ever gave up on me!

       I was telling Michael earlier that I lost a whole day yesterday.
       This morning I started reading Thursday's C&J and I could only rec
       some of the comments. I searched all around the site trying to see
       if I was still a TU and all sorts of things went through my mind. I
       was just about to email the admins when Mojo Friday posted. I had
       the first good laugh at myself that I have had in many moons. cH

   My deepest condolences on the loss of your mother.

   I went to the bottom and worked my way up, so only saw the other photos
   you posted first (without reading the messages) and thought "Great
   Smile!"  Now I've seen the series and read the messages, and I see that
   your Mom had a great smile at all times!  With a beautiful smile like
   that, she had to have been a treat to be around.

   {{{{{~cH~mjbleo~cH~}}}}} I'm leaving as many hugs out in cyberspace as
   you want for you to reach out and have whenever you feel like a hug.
   Hugs were the only real things when I was grieving, and while these are
   "only cyber-hugs," they are just as heartfelt as the kind I was given
   that meant so much to me.

   Be gentle with yourself during the grieving process.  You have lost the
   person who gave you life, and adjusting to her absence will be
   difficult (bit it will happen, eventually - I know this from
   experience).

   Or as I like to call this one "Furlough Day #4." JEERS to income loss.
   And I'm probably in better shape to deal with it than most of my
   colleagues are, which is pretty scary to contemplate. Ah well, only two
   more days of furlough to go...until September 30. After that all bets
   are off. Wanna bet the current crop of Republicans doesn't recall what
   the previous government shut-down did for them and their peerless
   leader Newt Gingrich?

   I voted for the married couples. Just because.

   CHEERS to being home. Had a completely uneventful two days of work on
   Las Vegas (if nothing happens in Vegas, apparently nothing STAYS in
   Vegas). Got on the plane--it was 105 degrees...which is about normal
   for Las Vegas. Got off the plane 90 minutes later: 65 degrees with fog
   on the hills. I love living in San Francisco.

   CHEERS to processes proceeding. Once off the plane and back home I had
   to head downtown to the bank to drop off yet another bank statement
   (for a credit union account) and sign more forms. Today the appraiser
   came by. I'm assuming there won't be any problems. Being a real estate
   appraiser myself I'm not supposed to opine on the value of anything
   without writing and signing a report and I'm REALLY not supposed to
   opine on the value of my own property since I'm supposed to be
   impartial. So I have to go with "according to Zillow" which says I have
   nothing to worry about. As for the appraiser well...nice guy but he
   struck me as not being very bright. Real estate appraisal--it ain't
   rocket science.

   To quote Tara, CHEERS to unions and JEERS to strikes. I don't
   personally rely on BART to get me to and from work (or really anywhere
   else) but a BART strike is going to make a mess of things. Trapper will
   probably have to use my car to get to work. This won't thrill either of
   us. Traffic's gonna suck. I STILL blame BART management. I suspect the
   union would be reasonably happy with a contract that resulted in a net
   increase in take-home pay even if it wasn't as much as they're asking
   for in their public statements but to hear management's side of it,
   you'd think management was being held for ransom and that employees
   were getting rich. Which they aren't. One of the funnier arguments I've
   seen: "How much could a job as a train operator be worth? After all the
   whole thing's automated!" On that basis why should supervisors and
   managers make two or three times more than the operators do? After all
   their employees don't do anything so what's to supervise? This of
   course is snark; what isn't snark is that it takes an awful lot of
   nerve to tell the public you think your employees are overpaid when you
   make several times as much as they do.

   CHEERS to Bill and Michael and to all of the other denizens of C&J.
   Special hugs to mjbleo.

       So wish I'd checked in upon waking.  Nothing to whoop it up over my
       dreadful tomatoes, I fear.....I might get a few Amish Paste out of
       the crop, but the rains and lack of temperatures and sun have taken
       a mighty toll....lol, the grapes were hit with Japanese Beetles
       before I knew what hit them, but the vines are still pretty.  :)  I
       so hope all is well with you and yours and that you are rolling in
       tomatoes!!!....and, yes ma'am....I will definitely share the love.
