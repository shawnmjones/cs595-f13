Obama: 'Trayvon Martin could have been me'

   By Tom Cohen, CNN
   updated 6:07 PM EDT, Fri July 19, 2013
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: Obama decided Thursday to speak out on the Martin case
     * NEW: Zimmerman's defense team says the verdict was just
     * President Obama explains African American frustration over the
       Trayvon Martin killing
     * He says demonstrations over the verdict must remain non-violent

   Washington (CNN) -- In unscheduled and unusually personal remarks,
   President Barack Obama tried Friday to explain why African-Americans
   were upset about last week's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the
   shooting death of Trayvon Martin while lowering expectations for
   federal charges in the case.

   "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago," Obama told White
   House reporters in a surprise appearance at the daily briefing.

   His remarks, which lasted about 20 minutes, escalated a nationwide
   debate on the verdict that has prompted protests, including some that
   turned violent.

   A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman last Saturday in Martin's February
   26, 2012, shooting death, inciting anger among many who considered the
   incident racially motivated murder.

   Obama issued a written statement on Sunday, noting that the jury had
   spoken and urging calm and reflection. Despite some calls for him to
   speak about the case, the nation's first African-American president had
   made no further public comment until Friday.

   Speaking without a teleprompter, Obama noted a history of racial
   disparity in law as well as more nuanced social prejudice that
   contribute to "a lot of pain" in the African-American community over
   the verdict.

   "There are very few African-American men in this country who have not
   had the experience of being followed when they are shopping at a
   department store. That includes me," the president said.

   "There are probably very few African-American men who have not had the
   experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on
   the doors of cars. That happens to me - at least before I was a
   senator," he continued.

   "There are very few African-Americans who have not had the experience
   of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and
   holding her breath until she had the chance to get off. That happens
   often," he said.

   Saying he didn't intend to exaggerate those experiences, Obama added
   that they "inform how the African-American community interprets what
   happened one night in Florida."

   "The African-American community is also knowledgeable that there is a
   history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws,
   everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws," he
   said. "And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people
   interpret the case."

   African-Americans feel the context of the Martin killing is little
   known or denied, "and that all contributes, I think, to a sense that if
   a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario that, from
   top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been
   different," Obama said.

   These cases usually matter for states

   At the same time, Obama responded to calls by civil rights groups for
   federal hate crimes charges to be filed against Zimmerman by saying the
   Florida legal process had reached a verdict.

   "Once the jury's spoken, that's how our system works," the president
   said, later adding that while Attorney General Eric Holder was looking
   further at the case, those calling for federal charges must "have some
   clear expectations here."

   In America, law enforcement and the criminal code are "traditionally
   done at the state and local levels, not at the federal level," he said.

   On Saturday, "Justice for Trayvon" vigils are scheduled outside federal
   buildings across the country by Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action
   Network.

   Sharpton called Obama's remarks Friday "significant and much needed,"
   saying in a statement that the president "set a tone for both direct
   action and needed dialogue."

   Martin's parents said they were "deeply honored and moved" that Obama
   spoke publicly about their son, saying the president's comments "give
   us great strength at this time."

   "Trayvon's life was cut short, but we hope that his legacy will make
   our communities a better place for generations to come," said the
   statement by Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton. "We applaud the
   president's call to action to bring communities together to encourage
   an open and difficult dialogue."

   However, some conservative commentators criticized Obama for what they
   called divisiveness by speaking as an African American instead of
   representing the entire country. Todd Starnes, a Fox News Radio anchor,
   tweeted "race-baiter in chief."

   [42]Stark contrast: How comments sparked very different reactions

   Zimmerman's defense team cited Obama's courage in addressing the case
   and its racial context, but said the facts showed their client acted in
   self-defense and the jury reached the proper verdict.

   "While we acknowledge the racial context of the case, we hope that the
   president was not suggesting that this case fits a pattern of racial
   disparity, because we strongly contend that it does not," the lawyers
   said in a statement.

   A White House official told CNN Chief White House correspondent Jessica
   Yellin that Obama decided Thursday night to make his public remarks
   after watching the reaction to the Zimmerman verdict over the past
   week.

   The official, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said
   Obama talked to friends and family members about the verdict, and told
   his senior staff he wanted to speak publicly about it. His staff
   recommended that he make the remarks in the White House briefing room,
   as opposed to an interview.

   In his remarks, Obama said demonstrations and other responses to the
   Zimmerman verdict must be non-violent or they will dishonor what
   happened to Martin and his family.

   He outlined possible future steps, calling for the Justice Department,
   state governors and city mayors to work with law enforcement agencies
   "about training at the state and local levels in order to reduce the
   kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists."

   For example, he noted that racial profiling legislation he pushed as a
   state senator in Illinois helped police departments think about the
   issue and act more professionally, which helped build trust with
   communities they serve.

   Stand your ground laws

   Obama also called for reconsideration of "stand your ground"
   self-defense laws in Florida and other states, that he said "may
   encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies
   that we saw in the Florida case, rather than diffuse potential
   altercations."

   Sharpton and other civil rights leaders call for abolishing the "stand
   your ground" laws.

   "If we're sending a message as a society in our communities that
   someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms,
   even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really
   going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order
   that we'd like to see?" Obama asked.

   [43]Protesters stand up to 'stand your ground,' but laws likely here to
   stay

   To supporters of such laws, Obama said they should consider if the
   right to fight back with a gun would have applied to Martin.

   "Do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr.
   Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened?"
   the president said. "And if the answer to that question is at least
   ambiguous, then it seems to me that we might want to examine those
   kinds of laws."

   While rejecting any "grand new federal program," Obama also called for
   providing more support for African-American boys and young mans who
   disproportionately end up in prison or homicide victims.

   No national conversation

   However, he rejected calls for him to launch a national conversation on
   race, saying "I haven't seen that be particularly productive when, you
   know, politicians try to organize conversations."

   His comment could have been a slap at his own response to the 2009
   arrest of African-American university professor Henry Louis Gates by a
   white police officer responding to a report of a possible burglary at
   his Boston-area home.

   After coming under criticism for saying police acted stupidly, Obama
   later invited the Harvard professor and the arresting officer for [44]a
   beer at the White House.

   On Friday, Obama instead endorsed "soul-searching" discussions in
   homes, churches and workplaces where people might be more honest about
   whether they were "wringing as much bias" out of themselves as
   possible.

   "As difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot
   of people, I don't want us to lose sight that things are getting
   better," the president concluded, making a reference to his daughters'
   generation.

   "It doesn't mean we're in a post-racial society. It doesn't mean that
   racism is eliminated," he said. "But, you know, when I talk to Malia
   and Sasha and I listen to their friends and I see them interact,
   they're better than we are. They're better than we were on these
   issues. And that's true in every community that I've visited all across
   the country."
