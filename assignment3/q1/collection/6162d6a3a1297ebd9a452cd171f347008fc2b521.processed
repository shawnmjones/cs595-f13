A different kind of Stone Age

   A truck on a gravel road near La Joya, Texas.

   A few years ago, the Wall Street Journal [3]described paved roads as
   "historical emblems of American achievement." But in era of strained
   budgets and fiscal conservatism, American achievements are a little
   tougher to come by.

   [4]Take Texas, for example (thanks to my colleague Tricia McKinney for
   the heads-up).

     The sharp increase in heavy traffic from a historic oil boom has
     damaged many farm-to-market roads in South and East Texas. The
     damage related to energy development has become so extensive that
     state and local authorities lack the funding to make all the
     repairs. Last month, the Texas Department of Transportation
     announced plans to convert more than 80 miles of paved roads to
     gravel. The conversions are expected to start Monday, TxDOT
     officials said. But the plan has been met with criticism from
     lawmakers and some of the farmers and ranchers who live near those
     roads.

     "Since paving roads is too expensive and there is not enough funding
     to repave them all, our only other option to make them safer is to
     turn them into gravel roads," TxDOT spokesman David Glessner said.

   The state legislature briefly considered tax increases on energy
   companies -- the companies that have benefited greatly from the energy
   boom, and which are chiefly responsible for pushing the roads quite
   literally past the breaking point -- but as you might have guessed,
   those proposals faced stiff political opposition and never gained
   traction in Austin.

   Darlene Meyer, a 77-year-old rancher whose property sits along a state
   road marked for conversion to gravel, told the Texas Tribune, "Texas
   used to have the best roads.... I just can't believe the Department of
   Transportation is going back to the dark ages."

   The larger context of this is important.
     __________________________________________________________________

   On the one hand, Gov. Rick Perry (R) [5]believes Texas' economy is
   amazing, and he's managed to strike the perfect balance between meeting
   the public's needs and keeping the private sector happy. Every other
   state, the governor assures us, should be following Texas' lead --
   after all, thanks to the energy sector, the Lone Star State has plenty
   of money.

   On the other hand, thanks to wear and tear from the oil companies,
   which have made themselves remarkably rich from Texas' resources, Texas
   can no longer afford to pave many of its roads, and will instead
   transition from pavement to gravel.

   The state must have known this was likely to happen, and had time to
   prepare for infrastructure needs, but ended up here anyway.

   Yup, seems like the best alternative name for the Republicans is
   Cowardly REGRESSIVES!

   When you are afraid to tell the businesses that are damaging the roads
   that they must pay for the damages they cause - even while they make
   HUGE amounts of money in your state - I would say there is a serious
   problem with the Texas way of doing business!

   They do pay the taxes. And the General Fund appreciates that, because

   The taxes being paid are insufficient to maintain the roads. The
   INTELLIGENT thing to do would be to adjust the tax to a level high
   enough to repair the damage caused by the trucks. The DUMB thing to do
   is to just downgrade the road quality.

   The DUMB choice leads to more air pollution, more accidents (can't stop
   as fast on dirt as you can on pavement), and more damage to the
   tires/underbodies of the vehicles that use the roads in addition to the
   oil trucks. (thrown rocks smash windshields, damage the bodies of the
   vehicles). All-in-all, the damage resulting from doing the DUMB thing
   is more expensive to the populace than simply raising taxes would
   impose on the economy.

   Guess which route the REPUBLICANS chose to follow.

   And BIG OIL could care less... they will merely shift their truck
   operations to nearby PAVED (at least still paved) roads and destroy
   them as well. They will continue to do this until the good (paved)
   roads are so few and far between that it's cheaper for the oil
   companies to drive slower on the gravel roads than to go out of their
   way to drive on paved roads... But the truck drivers will probably NOT
   slow down... tearing up the gravel roads even more.

   live near the areas their overweight trucks are tearing up. So the
   ranchers and others who do . . . are just unfortunate in their choice
   of zip code. Their roads won't be repaired. Most Texans aren't The

   I moved to the DFW area 4 months ago to be closer to part of my
   family--and to help turn it blue I kid. I have been amazed and dismayed
   at all the highway construction going on in this area all at the same
   time (4 freeways that I have encountered so far and one toll road.) I
   assumed the money came from the Federal general funds and from
   "stimulus" programs that the reds here disdain so much. In two places I
   have seen roads that had to have been built on the theory "build it
   they will come" maybe. I've also mused that this is the way they keep
   employment figures up.

   As a Californian, I laugh at what is considered rush hour traffic. I
   only avoid the horrid construction zones with missing signs and single
   lanes even the natives complain about.

   Lastly, the freeways I do travel are open enough for drag racing and
   cutting in and out of lanes, and tailgating for fun. How do so many
   young white males get away with it? (As a whitey myself I can make this
   comment!) I think it might be that there is no highway patrol in
   populated Texas. Local police forces cities are responsible for freeway
   portions in their own town. There is a state patrol for rural areas but
   I guess Texas will be needing fewer of those as they convert rural
   roads to gravel.

   I advise all those red-necks in the boonies explore the DFW area to see
   where the road money is being spent.

   The damage to a road in in proportion to the fourth power of the axle
   load of the vehicles that drive on it. Look at diesel taxes and look at
   gasoline taxes. We generally subsidize heavy truck traffic, but we do
   it in exchange for the economic benefit they bring. Because you still
   have to attract customers, that's why the roads around malls and
   businesses districts are generally in pretty good shape. Less so in
   industrial zones. But out in the boonies, nobody but the locals see the
   damage and the goods these trucks haul aren't going to suffer from a
   few potholes. This isn't unique to Texas. Texas is just seeing it on a
   large scale.

   Business has, for the last few decades, been slacking off on their part
   of the social contract.

   Well, if you start using the word "debt" to describe a lot of things
   that are not debt, sure, the amount of "debt" skyrockets. Ordinarily
   the word is used to describe "money that has been borrowed and will be
   repaid." It doesn't mean "costs that will have to be paid at some point
   in the future." Because, well, that has nothing to do with whether
   money has been loaned or borrowed.

   Taylo019, I wouldn't be talking about economics professors and all that
   if you haven't even read what Adam Smith said about fiat vs. specie
   currency back in 1776.

   Gold (or silver) has no value beyond its inherent usefulness. It is
   dead stock. Fiat money is simply an abstraction of the value of goods
   and labor in the market. But you guys don't understand abstractions
   very well. If you did, you'd understand that those unfunded liabilities
   are the same as any other pension system, based upon future investment
   returns. Since the investment they are making is in the continued
   success of the American economy, they're pretty secure. Unless somebody
   does something really stupid like, oh, refusing to pay the bills by not
   raising the debt limit and trashing our good credit built over 230
   years. That's what will take down Social Security and all the money you
   have invested in it.

   Billionaires are billion-aires in what? Cheese doodles? There isn't
   enough mineable gold and silver in this world to supply the world
   economy with a Mises-friendly Austrian 100% reserve currency without
   contracting the economy because trade velocity would ground to a halt.
   You live in a fantasy world.

   I can understand survivalist loons being goldbugs. They're constantly
   worried that the world is going to hell in the next generation. Just
   like granddaddy said. And his granddaddy a'fore 'im. It's the
   conservatives who like to call themselves patriots that puzzle me.

     Yeah your probably right, what do economics professors and
     billionaires know anyway about this kind of stuff? In 08 they were
     just lucky.

   You mean the ones who were predicting hyperinflation in 2009, and they
   got lucky that it didn't happen? The ones who wiped their brows in
   relief and then predicted hyperinflation in 2010? And when that didn't
   happen predicted hyperinflation in 2011, 2012, and 2013? Those experts?

   I agree -- they've been very lucky.

     Do any of you understand the math associated with our debt?

   Yes. And the fact that you can't answer [191]#14.3 tells me you don't.
   Or perhaps do, but answering wouldn't serve your agenda.

   So I'll put it another way to hammer the point home: using the same
   accounting methods that got you that $70T number, what is the debt
   including unfunded liabilities for the US private sector?

   Im not betting, its simple math. We are in a unique position where we
   can make more money anytime we desire. We owe more than we can pay back
   without making more money. eventually one of our debtors is going to
   say they are no longer doing business with a country who de-values its
   own currency and the dollar will fall.

   This is going to happen, most economist are saying within 10 years.

   Most? Which ones? Please supply a survey that supports your assertion.

   If we continue to cut government, it could happen a lot sooner.
   Austerity hasn't worked out so well for some of the European countries.

   Government spending fuels the economy. It produces more than it costs
   and makes us all wealthier.

   Austerity dampens the economy. It takes money out of circulation in the
   private sector as well as the public sector.

   You are worried about 70T of liabilities. Where did you get that
   figure? What time period? Does that include SS that will be paid out
   over the next 50 years? What are our assets over that same time period?

   This is why I don't get rural support for deregulation. I guess they
   figured deregulation meant getting the government out of their farming
   or ranching business. They didn't understand it really meant getting
   government out of the way of rapacious, polluting corporations. Just
   wait till the state decides to privatize the farm to market roads and
   they have to pay tolls just to get to town.

   Some of the farmers I talk to get annoyed with environmental
   regulations (some of them at the state level), especially where it
   concerns wildlife that may be excreting in the fields. Some of the
   regulations are almost impossible to comply with and are written by
   people who have apparently never kept a garden or are targeted at
   corporate farms but have unintended consequences for small or organic
   farmers.

   Okay. You elect representatives that think ALL government is bad and
   ALL government spending is evil. Then you "can't believe" your
   anti-government reps won't spend any money?

   Might I point out that paving roads uses asphalt and oil, both of which
   are Petroleum Products. So the Big Oil bastards make money coming and
   going, even if they DO pave the roads. Just not as much money as if
   they don't. Nice.

   Hadn't thought of that. Do you know what another name for asphalt is?
   Bitumen. Perhaps they're figuring that when Keystone XL gets linked up
   they can sneak in in the middle of the night and tap into it to pave
   the gravel.

   You can even take it a step further:

   Tires that run consistently on gravel don't last as long as tires that
   run on asphalt. So the locals would be buying more tires than they have
   in the past. The tire manufacturers are one of the biggest users of...
   wait for it... Petroleum Products.

   They make it coming and going, I tell ya'. Talk about a rigged game!
