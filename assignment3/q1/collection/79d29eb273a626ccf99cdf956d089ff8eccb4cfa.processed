[22]Things very serious people say

   Speaker John Boehner, Rep. Paul Ryan, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, Rep. Eric
   Cantor and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
   Every Serious Person in Washington, D.C. knows that the big problem
   facing our nation isn't creating jobs and growing the middle
   class--it's getting a our national debt under control. They know this
   because House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan created a spreadsheet
   with some scary charts of what things might be like in the 2070s.
   (Rumor has it that he created the charts with nothing but his dimples
   and abs.)

   So when Ryan said over the weekend that the country [29]isn't facing an
   immediate debt crisis, Very Serious People were right to be dismayed.
   After all, how can Paul Ryan possibly convince Americans to support his
   plan to balance the budget in ten years if he says there's not an
   immediate debt crisis? If Ryan says there's no debt crisis, people
   might get crazy ideas--like believing that creating jobs should be our
   top priority, not austerity.

   Fortunately, Paul Ryan has a boss: House Speaker John Boehner. And
   Speaker Boehner knows there's a debt crisis. He [30]said so in
   December, dismissing President Obama's plan to replace the sequester
   and end Bush tax cuts for the wealthy because "his plan does not begin
   to solve our debt crisis."

   But wait, I'm just learning now that Boehner has recanted. This weekend
   [31]he said:

     We do not have an immediate debt crisis.

   Asked specifically whether he agreed with President Obama who has said
   we don't have an immediate debt crisis, Boehner said "yes." Don't get
   me wrong, he still says he wants to make huge spending cuts, because
   eventually he says we'll have a crisis--but he says we don't have one
   right now.

   But just because Boehner is changing how he talks about whether or not
   there's a debt crisis, it's not like he's actually changing his
   policies. Sure, it would be reasonable for him to change, given that
   the budget deficit [32]has dropped by half since 2009 while the
   unemployment rate is still stuck near 8 percent. But that's not
   happening. Republicans might be saying there's no debt crisis, but
   austerity is still the only thing they are offering.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [44]Tagging tips - [45]Search For Tags - [46]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [47]Civil
   Rights, [48]Community, [49]Congress, [50]Culture, [51]Economy,
   [52]Education, [53]Elections, [54]Energy, [55]Environment, [56]Health
   Care, [57]International, [58]Labor, [59]Law, [60]Media, [61]Meta,
   [62]National Security, [63]Science, [64]Transportation, or [65]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([66]California, [67]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

       It always serves to redistribute wealth and income upwards, away
       from wages and into profits, rents and interest.
       The US, and in our wake, the rest of the world have unquestioningly
       embraced neoclassical capitalist economics in the past 40 years.
       Somehow, at some point, there will be a stage of crisis for all the
       very same reasons original classical capitalist economics was
       abandoned in all the world outside the colonial resource states,
       and even in some of them.

       If it means tolerating the sequester, we could be worse off. And we
       will be with almost anything the Republicans will let get through
       the House in this session.
       A fine President is faced with very few practical alternatives to
       the intransigent House and nearly dysfunctional Senate. So, put
       good ideas forth, advocate for them and make members of Congress
       from both parties get on record and vote on as many as possible.
       The campaign ads and stump speeches for 2014 will be written in the
       words of what good legislators did their best to pass in 2013 and

   Ain't nothin' important getting through that dysfunctional body!

   The track for the foreseeable future (that is, until January 2015): the
   Senate will have to pass a bill that Speaker Boehner can stomach
   putting on the House floor, meaning that he's willing to tolerate Nancy
   Pelosi delivering Democrats to help pass it.

   If the going gets tough, the House can hang on amendments and go to
   conference with the Senate. (Which Tea Party zealots will surely regard
   as capitulation because conferences involve compromise.)

   For Republicans it is all about the marketing catch phrase and the

   switching out of one idea and into another because their marketing is
   not their product. Their product is to privatize everything to the
   point that domestic government and services are all at the service of
   corporations and wealth accumulators (the bigger the better). They
   can't sell that product to very many people so they are always
   marketing/lying to con folks into supporting their politicians and

 No immediate crisis ([257]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [258]coffeetalk

   Depends, of course, on what you mean by "immediate." Lewison keeps
   steering us to that now-superseded $845 Bn figure, which even the CBO
   has now jacked up to $983 Bn, still on the same rosy assumption that
   the sequester continues and the "doc fix" stays as-is. So, at a bare

   under any scenario.

       like that.  It is simply not credible to use numbers that (1) have
       been superseded; and (2) assumes we are not going to do the "doc
       fix" when we just DID the "doc fix" again [264]on December 31.
       So, assuming the sequester continues, we're back up to a deficit of
       about $1 trillion ($983 billion plus the doc fix). That's a cut in
       a deficit that reached almost $1.5 trillion, but it's not "halved"
       and an annual $1 trillion deficit is not sustainable over the long
       term.

   Since each blockade they come up with ends up failing lately
   (thankfully) they need some excuse that they think makes them not look
   like they have backed down.

   Since it's getting closer to the end of the month I was wondering how
   they were going to work their way out of this latest one.

   Too bad it doesn't make those who believe everything that comes out of
   their mouths realize that these Republicans have been bsing the whole
   time.

   So now they are going to try to quietly back down by having the "debit
   crisis" no longer be a "crisis".

   Now I know why my neck hurts. It's all this flip-flopping.

 They are right and wrong. ([272]1+ / 0-)

          [273]VClib

   Assuming we keep taxes at the level they are after the fiscal cliff
   deal, AND keep the sequester in place, we are probably about at a
   sustainable level.  Starting next year (when the tax increase after the
   fiscal cliff deal kicks in), we'll be back at about 19% of GDP, which
   is at the historical high end.  In other words, we don't need that
   extra trillion in tax revenue over the next 10 years.  Also, assuming
   the sequester stays in place, we'll be back down to 22% of GDP in
   outlays, which again is probably at a historical level, so no further
   cuts are necessary in the immediate term. OMB numbers on those things
   are summarzed [274]here.

   In other words, as the law exists now after the fiscal cliff deal and
   the sequester, we are probably ok as far as amount of tax revenue and
   amount of spending.  The problem is where that spending goes -- more
   and more of it, as a percentage of our budget, is going to entitlement
   programs.  In 10 years or so, the federal government will be largely a
   retirement and health care provider, with less and less ability to do
   other things.  The latest CBO estimates are that, over the next 10
   years, Social Security and health care spending alone will be 53% of
   the total federal budget.  CBO projections [275]here.  That doesn't
   count interest on the debt, defense, or any discretionary spending --
   all of those will have to shrink accordingly.  And that's before the
   costs of entitlements starts really exploding in 10 years or so.

   The real problem is Medicare (and Medicaid) 10 years from now.  (Pdf
   [276]here)  There's no way that, if we leave Medicare as is for the
   next 10 years, we will be able to avoid rationing end of life care AND
   imposing a broad-based, middle class tax increase, or -- as Krugman has
   put it repeatedly over the last 2 years -- "Death Panels and Sales
   Taxes."  Example [277]here.

   So, we can do nothing about Medicare for the next 10 years, and then
   tell seniors we are immediately going to start rationing end of life
   care (i.e., an 80 year old is not going to get the $100,000 treatment
   that has a 1 in 3 chance of extending life for 6 months) AND ALSO
   impose a broad based VAT tax, or we can begin to bend the cost curve
   now and try to avoid that situation, as well as free up some revenue to
   invest in things for the next generation.

     life care (i.e., an 80 year old is not going to get the $100,000
     treatment that has a 1 in 3 chance of extending life for 6 months)
     AND ALSO impose a broad based VAT tax, or we can begin to bend the
     cost curve now and try to avoid that situation, as well as free up
     some revenue to invest in things for the next generation,"
       this is exactly where we're going NOW.
       Come on--the VAT tax is just around the corner.  [Oh, maybe a year
       to three out.  They'll do what they can to muddy the waters so that
       most folks won't relate the current 'tax overhaul' with the new VAT
       tax, as usual, LOL!]
       And you know that Medicare reform will and does include measures to
       limit some procedures, etc, which occur mostly during end-of-life
       care.  That's what so-called 'best practices' is all about.
       After the taxes are slashed for the wealthy and the corporations
       (which the Administration is negotiating with Repubs, now), there
       will be a 'hue and cry' that, "By George!, we don't have a tax base
       that can support our needs (especially the social insurance
       programs)."
       I hear this all the time in congressional hearings on C-Span.  All
       of these steps will be incremental.
       What you just described is exactly what all 'the serious people' in
       both parties are working toward.
       And that would include folks such as former Democratic House
       Speaker Dick Gephardt.  I've even heard Norm Ornstein and his
       sidekick (can't remember his name now) who support the Dems'
       (corporatist) agenda of striking a Grand Bargain.
       That's one of the goals of the current tax overhaul.  It's just a
       matter of time.
       So, have to agree to disagree with you on this one.  ;-)

   I do believe the ship is about to turn.
   "No Immediate Crisis".
   Cast your mind back to (cue the ominous music),
   The Sequester.
   Once that became an actual thing and people started realizing how
   cutting government spending would impact them, how it would ripple out
   through the economy, how it would effect profits, the people who's
   profits would be trimmed squawked. Those Real Serious People collared
   the GOP "leadership" and tasked them with getting some stimulation of
   the econ...er, repealing parts of the sequester and cutting loose with
   the FUNDS, Jack!
   Austerity is NOT good for business.
   So the GOP has to escape from the box it made, hence the "realization"
   that deficits are "No Immediate Crisis".
   And we'll hear about Jobs Jobs Jobs(and tax cuts) next.
   OK, I'm just guessing about the conversation, but that's what it looks
   like to me.

 If that's the case ([290]0+ / 0-)

   and I do believe it is, why are is Obama and the Democrat's slapping
   our social services and 'entitlements'  on the table? All we hear from
   this administration is cuts, austerity, Grand Bargains chained CPI, and
   shared sacrifice? Why Simpson Bowles and this endless bs about fiscal
   cliffs of mass deception? Guess our choice as voters is which party of
   disaster capitalism is going to give us better brand of cat food to buy
   and if were lucky some peas to eat along with it.

   The Republicans are not only maniacs they are unabashed in their
   ideology of drowning the government and supply side trickle down. What
   pisses me off is that the Democrat's are going along with this bs.
   deficit hysteria. What kind of victory is compromise when both sides
   are operating on a false premise. Surreal and getting weirder by the
   day.

   It's apparent to anyone with a brain in their head that this has been
   cooked up by all of the players D's and R's alike. The kabuki is
   getting more and more ridiculous. I know what the Republicans are about
   but it's becoming clearer by the day that the Democrat's are inot
   better then teh evil R's in any way other then they won't probe your
   vagina, go full blown Ayn Rand on your ass, (hopefully) and are not
   theocratic fundamentalists.

   The Third Way forward is not Democratic and this administration's
   double speak/think has just lost it's main fear factor. Apocalyptic
   fiscal cliffs that the too big to fail uses to keep us all hostage and
   chained to an economy that's sole purpose is to impose 'austerity' and
   global oligarchical collectivism.  Cruel and disgusting. Tell me again
   why we can't have an economy that works for the common good of we the
   people and our country instead of creating some more wealth for Jaime
   Dimon? This will certainly make the kabuki harder to swallow.

 Pls see link below to a 'video' discussion of VAT ([302]0+ / 0-)

   taxes.  This discussion on VAT taxes came approximately 48 hours after
   the November election, LOL!

   This is the ultimate goal of our Washington elites, in regard to a tax
   overhaul.

   What we're seeing now, is 'just the tip of the iceberg,' and a dress
   rehearsal!

   [303]The Lame Duck Session and the New Congress

   Apparently, many lawmakers and think tanks believe imposing a national
   sales (VAT) tax is the best way to finance our social insurance
   programs, once they slash the tax rates for the wealthy and the
   corporations.

     Oh, and on a somewhat related topic, it's been reported in the
     Financial Times that the Administration has assured Republicans that
     they will go along with dropping corporate tax rates, and make it
     "revenue neutral" for them.

     Translation:  Corporations will bear no fiscal responsibility
     regarding paying taxes to help with the so-called debt or deficit
     crisis.

     We all know what this means:  Average Americans will pull the weight
     of income taxes, at the same time that they experience cuts to our
     social insurance programs.

     Here an excerpt and a [304]link to the Financial Times piece:
     Obama Pledges Corporate Tax Revamp

     March 17, 2013 4:40 pm
     By James Politi in Washington

     President Barack Obama has made a sweeping overhaul of the US
     corporate tax code a key pillar of his charm offensive towards
     Republicans to secure a big deficit deal, raising hopes among
     business groups but potentially putting the president at odds with
     some members of his own party.

     According to participants in closed-door meetings last week between
     Mr Obama and congressional Republicans, the president said he was
     committed to a revamp of US corporate taxes that would lower the top
     rate from its current level of 35 per cent, which is among the
     highest in the developed world.

     Crucially, Mr Obama reassured Republicans that he was looking to
     make the effort "revenue neutral" - meaning it would be fully paid
     for by curbing or scrapping tax breaks, but it would not seek to hit
     corporations with additional revenues for deficit reduction, which
     the liberal wing of the Democratic party would like to see.

     "He said something pretty interesting, he said he is for revenue
     neutral corporate reform," said one Republican congressman in the
     House of Representatives who met Mr Obama with other members of the
     party. "I've never seen that definitive a statement from the
     president on that issue, so I thought that was positive. The big
     question is, will it be followed up by meaningful action?"

     Deb Fischer, a freshman Republican senator from Nebraska who was
     backed by the Tea Party, also said she was "encouraged" by the
     president's remarks to Republicans in Senate last week.

     "If you're going to look at lowering the corporate tax rate and
     making it revenue neutral, you're talking about comprehensive tax
     reform there. So I hope that's the direction that we can go," Ms
     Fischer said.

     Last year, Mr Obama's Treasury department under Tim Geithner
     proposed to lower the corporate tax rate to 28 per cent and offered
     several options for closing tax breaks that would pay for the
     effort.

     But many Republicans, and some lobbyists for business, said they
     were never convinced that the president was determined to ensure a
     revenue-neutral outcome, especially since he has supported one-off
     measures to curb tax breaks for certain industries, such as oil and
     gas, in the absence of a big fiscal deal.

     US business groups have been lobbying heavily for several years for
     corporate tax reform, and growing increasingly impatient that it has
     not been enacted. Even though many big companies pay much lower
     effective tax rates than 35 per cent, they argue that reforms would
     boost the competitiveness of American multinationals, and encourage
     them to repatriate and invest cash stashed overseas in America.
