[22]GOP aide on Benghazi theater: 'You've got to be on Mars to come up with
some of this stuff'

   Twelve orbits a day provide the Mars Global Surveyor MOC wide angle
   cameras a global
   New bumper sticker: Democrats are from Earth, Republicans are from Mars
   Couldn't have [29]said it better myself:

     "We have got to get past that and figure out what are we going to do
     going forward," a GOP aide stressed. "Some of the accusations, I
     mean you wouldn't believe some of this stuff. It's just -- I mean,
     you've got to be on Mars to come up with some of this stuff."

   Fortunately--at least from a political perspective--whoever said that
   is just about the only person in the Republican Party who realizes what
   a cluster** Benghazi has become for their party. Just ask Rep. Jason
   Chaffetz, who [30]said yesterday that Benghazi might lead to Obama's
   impeachment--not because he's uncovered anything that Obama did in
   Benghazi was impeachable, but because Obama hasn't helped the committee
   find the nonexistent evidence that would justify his impeachment. And
   yeah, that's an idea from Mars.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [41]Tagging tips - [42]Search For Tags - [43]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [44]Civil
   Rights, [45]Community, [46]Congress, [47]Culture, [48]Economy,
   [49]Education, [50]Elections, [51]Energy, [52]Environment, [53]Health
   Care, [54]International, [55]Labor, [56]Law, [57]Media, [58]Meta,
   [59]National Security, [60]Science, [61]Transportation, or [62]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([63]California, [64]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

   for almost 15 years is this with staffers.* They tend to break down
   into three groups (in no direct order). (1) Family members or younger
   friends/children of large donors. Usually very young. (2) Folks that
   are very political and think being an entry/middle level staffer they
   can will change the world. (3) Maybe in the group that gave that quote
   above, those that plan to make a life in politics either as a staffer
   or eventually running for office. I'd say these are the realist.

   It stuns me we don't hear more from this third group. This is the group
   that makes our government run. I mean you don't think that
   Congressperson actually writes a bill do you. Or a speech. Or
   researches policy. Schedules and organizes an event. This group used to
   be larger IMHO, bet they are much smaller now and getting kicked out by
   the second group.

   It is the "career" staffers that make things happen. And my experience
   (from more than a decade ago) more times then not many would choose to
   hop to the other side of the aisle if a better job came up. Just like
   you might hop from your company, that you really like, to maybe a
   direct competitor if a better job offer was put on the table.

   You know, just wanted to throw that out there ....

       if the person they work for losses an election, they could of

       party loses control of the House or Senate, well the losing party
       has their staff cut.
       I know I'd fight for my job and I have to think there are more than
       a few "longterm" staffers that see the "writing on the wall" and
       are fearful of losing their jobs in several different ways.
       Nobody that is "sane" wants to lose their job.

       the "realist" will always take the side backed by the biggest money
       and centers of power.  Thus what we've come to call "pragmatism" is
       always, without fail, the corporatist/neocon/neoliberal agenda,
       with no deviation permitted.  (Corporatism can pass itself off as
       "moderate" as its interests don't require it to take positions on
       certain "hot-button social issues.

 Your Third Group is the professionals. ([322]1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          [323]PsychoSavannah

   They are not the handmaidens of Senators and House members.

   They have responsible jobs to do. Certainly, they are affected by
   political winds, but they're the ones everyone turns to, to get things
   (1) done, (2) on target, (3) correctly and (4) in a trustworthy way.
   They know the players, the system and each other.

   Many are not "political" at all, although they often have an affinity
   with one party or the other. (In my day, many years ago, several
   deliberately abstained from politics altogether, such as the staff of
   the Joint Tax Committee, whose very apolitical nature was vital to
   writing and analyzing tax proposals. When push came to shove, all
   political sides and the rest of the world had to trust the same group
   of professionals.)

   Those staffers know Kabuki theatre when they see it. It's entertaining
   but it has little to do with them until it impedes the work they know
   must be done.

   To them, the fictive flusterings of extremist elected officials impede
   governance. That isn't "realism;" it's reality.

   2014 IS COMING. Build up the Senate. Win back the House : 17 seats.
   Plus!

   Republican's won't bold faced lie about it anyway....

     Senior GOP aides pointed out that many of the accusations involving
     security and military forces turned out to be unfounded. One recent
     example involved a supposed whistle-blower who reported that an
     armed Predator drone was operating in the area, but was not called
     upon to respond to the Benghazi attack, an assertion labeled
     erroneous by Pentagon officials and Hill staffers.

     "There are some real issues there and then there is just some crazy
     stuff," the senior House GOP aide said. "The crazy stuff is, you
     know, the airman in Ramstein [Air Base, Germany,] that knew that the
     Predator [drone] was armed. There are no armed Predators in the
     region there. The [status of forces agreement] does not allow us to
     fly them armed, and everybody knows it."

   They really don't think beyond playing to their extremist base of
   "please lie to me and make me hate Obama more" sycophants.

   Someone once asked me why do you always insist on taking the hard road?
   and I replied why do you assume I see two roads?

   Has been since Whitewater(gate). Nixon "won" the 60s and then got
   kicked out, but the "conservative" side of the culture is supposed to
   be morally upstanding so how the hell did that happen? Shouldn't it be
   a pot smoking hippie (Clinton) or thugged out Muslim gangbanger (from
   Harvard !![note to self: movie pitch]) that gets caught in a web of
   lies.

   Powell's speech to the UN was most likely the single most criminal act
   by an administration since maybe Johnson prevaricating in the early
   days of his involvement with the Vietnam fiasco. But that's not a
   scandal because FREEDOM.

   They just can't take losing the culture war on all fronts. And they are
   a HUGE voting block, far outnumbering the left and idiot left combined.
   And they have their very own echo chamber with Fox plus spineless group
   think.

   And it's another example of Obama admin can't anyone here play this
   game. Any real push back besides eye rolling? Bush appointees target
   tea party groups by name - maybe spell that out. Liberals get turned
   down. Bush targeted a CHURCH. Maybe mention that?

   We really need more and better and more competent Democrats.
