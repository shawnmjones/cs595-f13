   News!  In-A-Nutshell!

   Reverse World War Two, on the march!

   After the Battle of the Deficit began, Automatic Austerity was
   unleashed!

   A new America with common purpose was born!

   Realistic expectations were set,

   A call to arms was heard,

   And the battle was led, once again, by our nation's armed forces!

   All for none and none for all was the call heard round the nation . . .

   Because everyone knows the government cannot create jobs,

   And the rich and defenseless must be defended!

   Remember, we must all be on our guard,

   And help reduce the deficit at all costs!

   On the home front, cut the deficit in your own backyard,

   At the workplace,

   Even children get in on the action!

   And remember-- disease means deficit cuts are working!

   Flying is for birds, not our boys.

   Let's starve the beast and Battle the Deficit so that freedom from
   taxes reigns eternal!

   Good night and . . . cut-cut.

   You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.

   Add keywords that describe this diary. Separate multiple keywords with
   commas.
   [62]Tagging tips - [63]Search For Tags - [64]Browse For Tags
   ?

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: [65]Civil
   Rights, [66]Community, [67]Congress, [68]Culture, [69]Economy,
   [70]Education, [71]Elections, [72]Energy, [73]Environment, [74]Health
   Care, [75]International, [76]Labor, [77]Law, [78]Media, [79]Meta,
   [80]National Security, [81]Science, [82]Transportation, or [83]White
   House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state
   ([84]California, [85]Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are
   many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these
   tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

 I don't know how old you are, but I used to watch ([157]0+ / 0-)
       "Time for Beany" on TV and adored it. It was "for kids" but I
       remember much of the humor was also very adult and "in."
       He worked with Daws Butler on that one. (I'm talking about the
       original hand puppet show; the "Beany and Cecil" program, a
       cartoon, came later and by then I wasn't watching much children's
       programming.)
       I looked up Freberg on Wikipedia and it seems that Albert Einstein
       of all people was a fan of "Time for Beany." Jesus!

       should have to take a [182]commercial flight brings a tear to my
       eye as well..

     As the federal government braces for a new round of cost-cutting
     today, a new government report found that taxpayers shelled out
     $11.4 million in added costs to fly top Justice Department officials
     on the luxury jets.

     Two Gulfstream V jets were leased by Congress in 2007 for the FBI to
     use for counter-terrorism operations, but the Government
     Accountability Office found 60 percent of flying hours were for
     "non-mission" flights.
     Holder and his predecessor, AG Michael Mukasey, used the jets for
     business and personal trips 88 times, according to the GAO. FBI
     Director Robert Mueller has flown aboard the Gulfstream 10 times.
       I'm sure the FBI agents required to take furlough days will feel
       better knowing their dear leader is comfy on a Gulfstream..

 AG and FBI Director required to use govt flights ([186]1+ / 0-)

        Recommended by:
                [187]PSzymeczek

       If you had bothered to read the 2nd paragraph of this "unbiased"
       FauxNews article:
       "Those officials -- which included Holder and Mueller, as well as
       former Attorneys General Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales --
       racked up nearly 700 "nonmission" trips between 2007 and 2011, at a
       cost of $11.4 million, according to the Government Accountability
       Office.
       Those officials are required to use government aircraft, and in
       some cases reimbursed the government for a portion of the
       expenses."
       The GAO report specifies the requirement for professional AND
       private flights, for security reasons. Also note half of these
       flights occurred during the Bush-era administration, despite this
       omission in several right-wing media outlets.

 Well c'mon now guys, to be fair, the ([224]0+ / 0-)

   reason the Republicans can't conceive of a mere 80 Some Billions of
   dollars in cuts being painful is that to them it just ain't that much
   money.

   After all, the good ol' Federal Reserve often gives some eighty
   billions of  dollars to entities like Citigroup in a single month.
   (Okay, technically they "loan" it, but experts now say that some 4.7
   trillions of dollars that  have been loaned will never be paid back.)

   In other news, an entire anti-drug task force, the "Panama group" has
   been indicted for being part of the drug smuggling and drug selling
   problem. Well, hey, at least thy were raising money! Maybe we should
   just legalize drugs and start taxing those who sell the product. (If we
   ended the DEA, we would be saving some 10 billion a year!)
