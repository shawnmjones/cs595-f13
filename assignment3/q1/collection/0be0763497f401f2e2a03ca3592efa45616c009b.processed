   More about this programme: [14]http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wgq0l
   Hans Rosling's famous lectures combine enormous quantities of public
   data with a sport's commentator's style to reveal the story of the
   world's past, present and future development. Now he explores stats in
   a way he has never done before - using augmented reality animation. In
   this spectacular section of 'The Joy of Stats' he tells the story of
   the world in 200 countries over 200 years using 120,000 numbers - in
   just four minutes. Plotting life expectancy against income for every
   country since 1810, Hans shows how the world we live in is radically
   different from the world most of us imagine.
