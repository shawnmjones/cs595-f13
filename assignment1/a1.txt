Assignment #1
Due: 11:59pm Sept 12

1.  Demonstrate that you know how to use "curl" well enough to
correctly POST data to a form.  Show that the HTML response that
is returned is "correct" (e.g., save it to a file and then view
that file in a browser and take a screen shot).

2.  Write a Python program that:
  1. takes one argument, like "Old Dominion" or "Virginia Tech"
  2. takes another argument specified in seconds (e.g., "60" for 
     one minute).
  3. takes a URI as a third argument: 
     http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/scoreboard
     or
     http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/scoreboard?w=1&c=all&y=2012
     or
     http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/scoreboard?w=2&c=all&y=2012
     etc.
  4. downloads the URI, finds the game corresponding to the team
     argument, prints out the current score (e.g., "Old Dominion 27, 
     East Carolina 17), sleeps for the specified seconds, and then
     repeats (until control-C is hit).

3.  Consider the "bow-tie" graph in the Broder et al. paper (fig 9):
    http://www9.org/w9cdrom/160/160.html

    Now consider the following graph:

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    C --> A
    C --> G
    E --> F
    G --> C
    G --> H
    I --> H
    I --> J
    I --> K
    J --> D 
    L --> D
    M --> A
    M --> N
    N --> D
    
    For the above graph, give the values for:

    IN: 
    SCC: 
    OUT: 
    Tendrils: 
    Tubes: 
    Disconnected:
